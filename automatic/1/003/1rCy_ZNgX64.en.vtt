it does take some amount of skill to

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.520 
it does take some amount of skill to
learn<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.390> worth<00:02:15.720> learning<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.290> because

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
call it then all I'm gonna say is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780 
call it then all I'm gonna say is
definitely<00:02:31.380> fake<00:02:31.890> eyelashes<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.580> look

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
definitely fake eyelashes can look

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.090 
definitely fake eyelashes can look
amazing<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.960> if<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.290> naturally<00:02:34.740> occurring

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
amazing but if it's naturally occurring

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.550 
amazing but if it's naturally occurring
like<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.430> an<00:02:35.550> Asian<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.020> try<00:02:37.020> not<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.320> get<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
like with an Asian I try not to get the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.900 
like with an Asian I try not to get the
really<00:02:37.800> long<00:02:37.950> strips<00:02:38.400> you're<00:02:38.670> better<00:02:38.820> off

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
really long strips you're better off

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880 
really long strips you're better off
with<00:02:39.090> sort<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> third<00:02:39.690> lash<00:02:39.990> because<00:02:40.290> when

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
with sort of a third lash because when

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.470 
with sort of a third lash because when
the<00:02:40.980> eyelash<00:02:41.250> comes<00:02:41.490> too<00:02:41.730> close<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.120> here<00:02:42.360> at

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the eyelash comes too close in here at

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.330 
the eyelash comes too close in here at
the<00:02:42.570> inner<00:02:42.720> corner<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:43.470> close<00:02:43.710> in<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> eye

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the inner corner can close in the eye

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.880 
the inner corner can close in the eye
so<00:02:44.700> third<00:02:45.150> sort<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> third<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> lash<00:02:46.590> is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so third sort of a third of the lash is

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.420 
so third sort of a third of the lash is
much<00:02:47.460> better<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:49.050> mean<00:02:49.890> I've<00:02:50.040> got<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> lot
