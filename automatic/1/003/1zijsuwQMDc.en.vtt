this off of that now first couple of

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.269 
this off of that now first couple of
bolts<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.630> pretty<00:00:18.840> easy<00:00:19.080> you'll<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.130> those

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
bolts are pretty easy you'll see those

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.330 
bolts are pretty easy you'll see those
two<00:00:20.490> right<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.630> corresponds<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> some

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
two right there that corresponds to some

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.570 
two right there that corresponds to some
where<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.800> same<00:00:25.800> thing<00:00:25.830> here

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
where we're here same thing here

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.810 
where we're here same thing here
two<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.380> those<00:00:29.010> four<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> easiest

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
two over here those four are the easiest

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.900 
two over here those four are the easiest
bolt<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.300> remove<00:00:31.550> getting<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> more

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
bolt to remove getting to more

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.430 
bolt to remove getting to more
complicated<00:00:33.300> bolts<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> most

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
complicated bolts are the most

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.650 
complicated bolts are the most
complicated<00:00:34.920> ones<00:00:35.370> there's<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.210> ways<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> do

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
complicated ones there's two ways to do

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.500 
complicated ones there's two ways to do
this<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> correct<00:00:37.559> way<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.879> by

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this one is the correct way which is by

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080 
this one is the correct way which is by
removing<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.649> plastic<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> yeah<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
removing the plastic or the yeah the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
removing the plastic or the yeah the
plastic<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.600> goes<00:00:42.660> around<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.200> wheel<00:00:43.350> well

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
plastic that goes around the wheel well

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
plastic that goes around the wheel well
which<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.760> requires<00:00:44.969> removing<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> rim

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
which really requires removing the rim

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.619 
which really requires removing the rim
so<00:00:46.440> remove<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> rim<00:00:47.010> take<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> plastic<00:00:48.450> off

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so remove the rim take the plastic off

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
so remove the rim take the plastic off
and<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.170> give<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> access<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and that will give you access to this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.560 
and that will give you access to this
side<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.890> three<00:00:53.160> bolts<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.270> sitting

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
so make sure you remove all those and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.990 
so make sure you remove all those and
this<00:02:07.649> guy<00:02:07.890> will<00:02:08.129> comes<00:02:08.340> right<00:02:08.580> off<00:02:08.610> it's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this guy will comes right off it's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
this guy will comes right off it's
pretty<00:02:09.060> easy

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
pretty easy

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.990 
pretty easy
and<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.340> your<00:02:11.460> arc<00:02:11.610> seven<00:02:11.910> will

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and there's what your arc seven will

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.660 
and there's what your arc seven will
look<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.270> without<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.020> front<00:02:13.350> bumper<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
look like without a front bumper and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.090 
look like without a front bumper and
then<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.510> guess<00:02:15.690> if<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.020> really<00:02:16.140> crazy<00:02:16.410> you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
then I guess if you get really crazy you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.030 
then I guess if you get really crazy you
take<00:02:17.310> off<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.530> impact<00:02:19.530> material<00:02:19.650> or

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
take off the the impact material or

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.040 
take off the the impact material or
whatever<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.760> that's<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.870> short

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
whatever that is so that's a short

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.220 
whatever that is so that's a short
