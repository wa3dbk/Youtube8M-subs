00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.490 
get this this thing on and as and you
can<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.950> clips<00:02:17.280> onto<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.819> belt<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
can see it clips onto the belt on the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.160 
can see it clips onto the belt on the
figure<00:02:20.069> as<00:02:20.310> well<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.420> pull<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
figure as well so you just pull that and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.800 
figure as well so you just pull that and
then<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.920> pull<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:24.000> he's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
then you pull it up and you can see he's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.649 
then you pull it up and you can see he's
got<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.319> standard<00:02:25.939> standard<00:02:26.939> torso<00:02:27.420> under

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
got just a standard standard torso under

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.010 
got just a standard standard torso under
here<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.019> this<00:02:28.200> really<00:02:28.409> helps<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.830> bulk<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.640> out

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
here so this really helps to bulk it out

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.470 
here so this really helps to bulk it out
and<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.740> clips<00:02:32.130> right<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.490> there<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.330> like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
and just clips right on there just like

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.310 
and just clips right on there just like
so<00:02:33.750> pop<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> head<00:02:34.740> back<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.990> got<00:02:37.170> your

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
so pop the head back on and you got your

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.300 
so pop the head back on and you got your
juggernaut<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.960> he's<00:02:39.960> not<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:40.800> really<00:02:41.190> any

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
juggernaut and he's not not really any

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.960 
juggernaut and he's not not really any
bigger<00:02:41.670> than<00:02:42.000> your<00:02:42.180> average<00:02:43.250> Mega<00:02:44.250> Bloks<00:02:44.400> dude

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
bigger than your average Mega Bloks dude

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.510 
bigger than your average Mega Bloks dude
in<00:02:45.210> fact<00:02:45.680> he's<00:02:46.680> almost<00:02:46.980> even<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.280> little

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
in fact he's almost even a little

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.290 
in fact he's almost even a little
shorter<00:02:48.890> as<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.130> see<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.910> hair

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
shorter as you can see just a hair

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.750 
shorter as you can see just a hair
shorter<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.860> due<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.310> guy's<00:02:53.520> little

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
shorter just due to this guy's little

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.590 
shorter just due to this guy's little
hat<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.530> definitely<00:02:55.950> looks<00:02:56.310> larger<00:02:56.880> you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
hat but it definitely looks larger you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.740 
hat but it definitely looks larger you
can<00:02:57.660> see<00:02:57.840> he's<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.990> lot<00:02:58.140> bulkier<00:02:58.620> certainly<00:02:59.750> but

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
can see he's a lot bulkier certainly but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.780 
can see he's a lot bulkier certainly but
either<00:03:00.930> way<00:03:01.140> he's<00:03:01.290> very<00:03:01.440> very<00:03:01.620> cool<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.520> like
