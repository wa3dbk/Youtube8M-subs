wheat<00:00:16.049> Peter<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:16.740> stage<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> weed<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.490> at

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
wheat Peter what stage of weed are we at

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150 
wheat Peter what stage of weed are we at
here<00:00:17.820> yeah<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.960> whenever<00:00:19.500> you're<00:00:19.830> you're

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
here yeah so whenever you're you're

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.710 
here yeah so whenever you're you're
looking<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> wheat<00:00:20.789> field<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.270> important

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
looking at a wheat field it's important

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.390 
looking at a wheat field it's important
to<00:00:21.810> stage<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.109> both<00:00:22.619> from<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> weed<00:00:23.130> control

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to stage it both from a weed control

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.349 
to stage it both from a weed control
standpoint<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> also<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> fungicide

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
standpoint and also from a fungicide

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.339 
standpoint and also from a fungicide
standpoint<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:29.599> really<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:31.109> into<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
standpoint so really going into the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.790 
standpoint so really going into the
field<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> being<00:00:31.980> able<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:33.870> stage<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
field and being able to to stage that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.229 
field and being able to to stage that
weed<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.190> quite<00:00:35.370> important<00:00:35.850> by<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
weed it's quite important by the way you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.270 
weed it's quite important by the way you
look<00:00:36.480> across<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.050> field<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> gorgeous

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
look across this field what a gorgeous

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.540 
look across this field what a gorgeous
field<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.910> week<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> 27th<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.110> April

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
field a week for the 27th of April

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
field a week for the 27th of April
planted<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> 14th<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> September<00:00:42.840> really

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
planted the 14th of September really

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
planted the 14th of September really
drives<00:00:43.590> home<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> point<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.550> important

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
drives home the point how important

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
drives home the point how important
planning<00:00:45.840> date<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.280> start

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
planning date is but when you start

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.660 
planning date is but when you start
looking<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.210> weak<00:00:49.100> staging<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.219> growth

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
looking at this weak staging it growth

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.750 
looking at this weak staging it growth
stage<00:00:50.910> 31<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:52.460> important<00:00:53.460> stage

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
stage 31 is a really important stage

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
stage 31 is a really important stage
because<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.020> nitrogen<00:00:55.559> needs<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
because that's the nitrogen needs to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
because that's the nitrogen needs to
beyond<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.489> growth<00:00:56.760> stage<00:00:57.000> 31<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> weed

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
beyond by growth stage 31 and weed

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
beyond by growth stage 31 and weed
control<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:59.309> should<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.730> been<00:00:59.879> done<00:01:00.210> by

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
control really should have been done by

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
control really should have been done by
growth<00:01:00.660> stage<00:01:00.899> 331<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> those

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
growth stage 331 so that's one of those

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
growth stage 331 so that's one of those
stage<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.480> quite<00:01:03.750> important<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.350> able<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
stage it's quite important to be able to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.359 
stage it's quite important to be able to
tell<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.110> even<00:01:07.110> though<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.409> split<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> stem

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
tell and even though we split that stem

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.370 
tell and even though we split that stem
and<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> knife<00:01:10.140> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and you can do that with the knife it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.830 
and you can do that with the knife it's
quite<00:01:10.650> simple<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.909> walk<00:01:12.210> into<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> field

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
quite simple to just walk into the field

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
quite simple to just walk into the field
and<00:01:13.140> within<00:01:13.320> three<00:01:13.890> seconds<00:01:14.460> know<00:01:14.729> whether

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and within three seconds know whether

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
and within three seconds know whether
you're<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.240> grow<00:01:15.420> stage<00:01:15.689> 31<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you're at grow stage 31 or not what you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.550 
you're at grow stage 31 or not what you
need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.909> feel<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> base<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
need to do is feel at the base of the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
need to do is feel at the base of the
main<00:01:19.830> stem<00:01:20.250> find<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.850> plant<00:01:21.119> feel<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> base

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
main stem find a plant feel at the base

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
main stem find a plant feel at the base
of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> main<00:01:22.470> stem<00:01:22.950> go<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> soil<00:01:24.299> level

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of the main stem go to the soil level

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.219 
of the main stem go to the soil level
and<00:01:24.990> squeeze<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.270> feel<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.869> stem

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and squeeze and if you can feel the stem

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.980 
and squeeze and if you can feel the stem
crush<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> growing<00:01:30.720> point

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
crush then you know the growing point

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
crush then you know the growing point
has<00:01:31.200> come<00:01:31.439> above<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> ground<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.240> long<00:01:33.509> as

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
has come above the ground so as long as

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
has come above the ground so as long as
the<00:01:33.780> growing<00:01:34.020> point<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.409> below<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.920> ground

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the growing point is below the ground

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
the growing point is below the ground
there<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.610> no<00:01:35.640> stem<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.540> course<00:01:36.840> wheat<00:01:37.079> stems

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
there is no stem of course wheat stems

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.429 
there is no stem of course wheat stems
are<00:01:37.590> hollow<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.659> stem<00:01:39.869> doesn't<00:01:40.229> crush

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
are hollow so if the stem doesn't crush

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530 
are hollow so if the stem doesn't crush
you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.579> past<00:01:41.970> grow<00:01:42.270> stage

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
you know that you're not past grow stage

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
you know that you're not past grow stage
30<00:01:42.899> once<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> stem<00:01:43.710> crushes<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
30 once the stem crushes you know that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.420 
30 once the stem crushes you know that
your<00:01:44.909> ignore<00:01:45.180> stage<00:01:45.420> 31<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.890> here's<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
your ignore stage 31 and so here's a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
your ignore stage 31 and so here's a
plant<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.540> shows<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.020> quite

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
plant here that I think shows that quite

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.880 
plant here that I think shows that quite
nicely

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.440 

and<00:01:53.980> you<00:01:54.070> can<00:01:54.250> actually<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.730> you<00:01:54.940> look<00:01:54.970> closely

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
and you can actually if you look closely

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.570 
and you can actually if you look closely
you<00:01:55.690> can<00:01:55.840> see<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.110> bump<00:01:56.440> here<00:01:56.710> but<00:01:57.370> if<00:01:57.460> you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
you can see the bump here but if you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.970 
you can see the bump here but if you
crush<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.480> stem<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.110> just<00:01:59.320> feel<00:01:59.740> that

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
crush that stem if you just feel that

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.010 
crush that stem if you just feel that
stem<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.640> feel<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.060> crush<00:02:01.390> between<00:02:01.660> your

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
stem you can feel it crush between your

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.500 
stem you can feel it crush between your
fingers<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:03.070> stem<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.490> hollow<00:02:03.760> so<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.180> know

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
fingers the stem is hollow so you know

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.390 
fingers the stem is hollow so you know
for<00:02:04.780> sure<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:05.230> that<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.800> no<00:02:06.010> one<00:02:06.130> has<00:02:06.250> come

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
for sure that that that no one has come

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160 
for sure that that that no one has come
above<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.820> ground<00:02:07.060> then<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.750> can<00:02:07.900> feel<00:02:08.140> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
above the ground then you can feel that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.650 
above the ground then you can feel that
bump<00:02:08.710> in<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.310> stem<00:02:09.580> once<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.000> feel<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.390> bump

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
bump in the stem once you feel that bump

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.440 
bump in the stem once you feel that bump
you<00:02:11.170> say<00:02:11.350> okay<00:02:11.680> that's<00:02:11.860> growth<00:02:12.190> stage<00:02:12.430> 31<00:02:13.090> if

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you say okay that's growth stage 31 if

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.080 
you say okay that's growth stage 31 if
in<00:02:14.230> fact<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.710> go<00:02:14.860> above<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.430> bump<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.060> you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
in fact you go above that bump and you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.770 
in fact you go above that bump and you
can<00:02:16.720> crush<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.380> stem<00:02:17.830> again<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.630> again<00:02:19.630> it's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
can crush that stem again and again it's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.220 
can crush that stem again and again it's
Hollow

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
Hollow

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.780 
Hollow
that<00:02:20.709> means<00:02:20.950> you're<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.280> into<00:02:21.550> growth

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
that means you're going into growth

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.690 
that means you're going into growth
stage<00:02:22.060> 32<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.200> one<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.500> particular<00:02:23.700> you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
stage 32 so this one in particular you

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.510 
stage 32 so this one in particular you
can<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.240> can<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.870> barely<00:02:26.350> crush<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.220> put<00:02:27.430> a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
can you can just barely crush a we put a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.290 
can you can just barely crush a we put a
stem<00:02:27.820> above<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.900> first<00:02:29.320> node<00:02:29.700> 31<00:02:30.700> just

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
stem above that first node 31 just

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.350 
stem above that first node 31 just
starting<00:02:31.900> going<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.350> grow<00:02:32.530> stage<00:02:32.830> 32<00:02:33.520> on<00:02:34.060> this

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
starting going to grow stage 32 on this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.910 
starting going to grow stage 32 on this
particular<00:02:34.660> plant<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.350> that's<00:02:35.530> really

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
particular plant so that's really

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920 
particular plant so that's really
advanced<00:02:36.489> for<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.730> time<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:36.970> year<00:02:37.090> okay<00:02:37.900> so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
advanced for this time of year okay so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.300 
advanced for this time of year okay so
what<00:02:38.170> times<00:02:38.380> types<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.860> things<00:02:39.040> should<00:02:39.130> be

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
what times types of things should be

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.699 
what times types of things should be
looking<00:02:39.670> at<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.850> plant<00:02:40.780> at<00:02:40.900> grow<00:02:41.290> station<00:02:41.650> or

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
looking at a plant at grow station or

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.170 
looking at a plant at grow station or
the<00:02:41.739> thirty-one<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.280> there<00:02:42.430> early<00:02:42.700> diseases

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
the thirty-one is there early diseases

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.140 
the thirty-one is there early diseases
coming<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.750> there<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.650> typically<00:02:45.160> once

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
coming in is there so so typically once

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.810 
coming in is there so so typically once
we<00:02:46.330> get<00:02:46.510> into<00:02:46.810> into<00:02:47.200> stem<00:02:47.470> elongation<00:02:47.820> we

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
we get into into stem elongation we

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.000 
we get into into stem elongation we
would<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> good<00:02:49.690> canopy<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.739> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
would see a good canopy like this and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.890 
would see a good canopy like this and
absolutely<00:02:51.670> we'd<00:02:51.940> be<00:02:52.090> starting<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.540> look<00:02:52.690> at

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
absolutely we'd be starting to look at

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.290 
absolutely we'd be starting to look at
disease<00:02:53.350> pressure<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.190> whether<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:54.910> not<00:02:55.060> we

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
disease pressure and whether or not we

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.720 
disease pressure and whether or not we
needed<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.720> early<00:02:56.170> fungicide<00:02:56.770> of<00:02:57.220> course<00:02:57.550> in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
needed that early fungicide of course in

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.600 
needed that early fungicide of course in
this<00:02:57.970> particular<00:02:58.360> situation<00:02:59.160> it's<00:03:00.160> been<00:03:00.370> so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
this particular situation it's been so

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.550 
this particular situation it's been so
cold<00:03:00.940> at<00:03:01.120> night<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.510> we're<00:03:01.660> not<00:03:01.810> seeing<00:03:02.200> very

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
cold at night that we're not seeing very

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.190 
cold at night that we're not seeing very
much<00:03:02.739> disease<00:03:03.130> here<00:03:03.489> um<00:03:04.030> probably<00:03:04.480> confined<00:03:05.080> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
much disease here um probably confined a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.930 
much disease here um probably confined a
little<00:03:05.500> bit<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.709> septoria<00:03:06.040> quite<00:03:06.489> low<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
little bit of septoria quite low in the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.570 
little bit of septoria quite low in the
canopy<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.660> maybe<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.410> little<00:03:08.620> bit<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:08.920> mildew

canopy and maybe a little bit of mildew

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.759 
canopy and maybe a little bit of mildew
if<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:09.880> look<00:03:10.090> hard<00:03:10.360> into<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.750> overlap<00:03:11.380> areas

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
if we look hard into the overlap areas

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.710 
if we look hard into the overlap areas
one<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.130> key<00:03:12.310> things<00:03:12.580> about<00:03:12.730> mildew<00:03:13.299> is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
one of the key things about mildew is

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.810 
one of the key things about mildew is
that<00:03:14.019> almost<00:03:14.500> always<00:03:14.799> you<00:03:15.160> will<00:03:15.280> see<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.549> come

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
that almost always you will see it come

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.220 
that almost always you will see it come
where<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.090> have<00:03:16.269> either<00:03:16.420> doubled<00:03:16.959> up<00:03:17.019> your

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
where you have either doubled up your

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.470 
where you have either doubled up your
seed<00:03:17.500> or<00:03:18.040> doubled<00:03:18.549> up<00:03:18.610> your<00:03:18.760> nitrogen<00:03:19.180> where

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
seed or doubled up your nitrogen where

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.720 
seed or doubled up your nitrogen where
you<00:03:19.600> get<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.930> really<00:03:20.440> lush<00:03:20.739> canopy<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.519> where

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
you get that really lush canopy is where

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.210 
you get that really lush canopy is where
the<00:03:21.850> mildew<00:03:22.150> builder<00:03:22.720> starts<00:03:23.110> but<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the mildew builder starts but the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.280 
the mildew builder starts but the
research<00:03:24.850> up<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.360> this<00:03:25.480> point<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.019> of<00:03:26.110> course

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
research up to this point and of course

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.140 
research up to this point and of course
research<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.860> always<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> moving<00:03:27.549> target<00:03:27.760> but

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
research is always a moving target but

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.570 
research is always a moving target but
it's<00:03:28.299> quite<00:03:28.510> intriguing<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.890> research<00:03:30.310> would

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
it's quite intriguing the research would

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's quite intriguing the research would
say<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.600> average<00:03:31.959> we<00:03:32.470> only<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.890> about<00:03:32.980> a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
say that on average we only get about a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.820 
say that on average we only get about a
two<00:03:33.400> bushel<00:03:33.790> yield<00:03:34.120> increase<00:03:34.570> from<00:03:35.260> an<00:03:35.380> early

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
two bushel yield increase from an early

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.009 
two bushel yield increase from an early
fungicide<00:03:36.430> kind<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:37.030> this<00:03:37.269> stage<00:03:37.750> or
