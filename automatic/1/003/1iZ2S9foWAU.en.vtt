00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.430
 as a result, the import man is arrested and transferred to it 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.430
 bureau for questioning a quarter one 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.139
 the married couple 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.570
 He is recording a new video clip that the old dictator 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.360
 and look tell you about but see gamers 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.240
 those with a room foundation that exists today at the end user market again 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.320
 whatever you do and they work today, August 31 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.030
 in the shops 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.899
 but unfortunately after all a few ois does not promote the zoom 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.980
 you can use that mistake there 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.160
 are various conversations 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.909
 and a few attempts to return the game it was immediately hit 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.140
 what a pokémon 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.260
 and it will cost it to fight this pokémon 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.200
 it is a few expected however when that was apparently the first you texted 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.990
 from the case 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.699
 but otherwise it is completely mediocre 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.770
 after the match 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.620
 map that 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.090
 that everything is going to change by different formats has a bit 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 turn it upside down and that is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.630
 pokémon 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.110
 pokémon catch up the ride active pokémon from your opponent 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.930
 foot injury with the book voucher from his bank you can basically become a pokémon 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.560
 pull from his bank forward and attack we also hope an omnivore 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.100
 without it you have to throw a dice all students are often that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.090
 pokémon circulating al dabi the opponent could choose which pokémon from 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.260
 the bond and actions from the sponsorship 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.610
 new pokémon look put times is really specific pokémons on the frightened 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.330
 He turned back swollen pokémons that are good like 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 the sign he stopped when they are still small 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.700
 pokémon catcher looks like a kid on your own so he will change 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.240
 how people build their work so he will change hope people and streets no 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.610
 sound and perform they will actually change everything in the game 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.070
 you could not snap the big pokémons quietly on the couch and hide it on and on 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.560
 legs that adorn themselves but I can't do that anymore, in principle you can't 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.420
 pulling every pokémon of the debate forward and seeing the attacker 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.300
 Which 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.910
 especially the fast that becks but become much more dangerous because that fast one 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.300
 even if they can implement not only the plans can execute on 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.880
 those big strong pokémons nice head the smaller the weaker pokémons on the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.090
 bank 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.030
 many players will also have a pokémon cage and are working on a break up and 3 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.630
 percent 4 and you will see that and the so-called trainer becomes derks so index 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.079
 who ensured that 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.549
 We are called opponent cases when the players Kim trainer Kate can do more 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.279
 so use this doll for a while on paper will be a bit much 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.819
 People know people and he is the popo among the German and they can 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.299
 otherwise stop it 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.039
 pokémon emperor important card 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.870
 drastically revised brewers 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.880
 I have been tuned to him 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.499
 the signals that appear make the viewer 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.340
 bah and otherwise I had hoped 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.900
 the pokémon tickets and he was again this episode of pokémon locals
