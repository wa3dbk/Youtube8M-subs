00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.299
 the wind 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.429
 when he blows so hard 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.899
 nothing seems to be able to resist him 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.899
 not even the most massive trees 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.519
 head of state 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.339
 moving air 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.980
 for 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.839
 for 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.390
 the surface advise it up to thailand high pressure bass 

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:33.389
 pressures 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.490
 these cases of pollution are the reflection of differences in temperature etc in the 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.670
 area 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.940
 the group 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.170
 these masters traveling the planet 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 it helps to redistribute energy 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.920
 the movement of people also generated by differences in 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.960
 temperature is constant 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.870
 French 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.120
 against the mother 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440
 and the earth 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.600
 humanity has been able to capture and use the energy conveyed by these funds 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.540
 the installation of wind turbines is to use the wind to turn a wind 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 large list disk when the barrel on the lists 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.220
 the particular form of time allows it to master the mares of 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.840
 movements what constitutes our height 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.570
 the wind is stronger than to release the roughness of the ground the lycÃ©es so 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 placed at the top of a tower of several tens of meters 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.409
 the addition of an automatic system allows to orient the wind turbine facing the belly 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.240
 which increases its crosby efficiency so we see when listing them 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.870
 places do not begin to turn el akel the energy of the movement transmitted by 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.280
 the wind he proposes this energy is then transformed into electricity 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.450
 by performed on monday 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.259
