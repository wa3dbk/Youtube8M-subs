00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.980
 when everyone hops, a lot of people have 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.740
 asked to make a video about how 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.029
 clean the bucket and although I 'm not going to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.190
 discover nothing extraordinary 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.990
 I'm just going to tell you how I do it 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.010
 I and I hope it serves you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.450
 well the cube as a good pet that is 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.570
 he loves to feed he likes to drink 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.490
 a lot of lubricant and eat fluff then 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.740
 It is normal that with the passage of time 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.890
 we have a decrease in performance 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 of the bucket despite lubricating we notice 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.660
 that does not rotate the same as at the beginning 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.450
 then if we separate the pieces 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.880
 I'm going to take two pieces to teach you 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.930
 an example if we separate the pieces 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.600
 we will notice that a lot of dirt accumulates 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.060
 a lot of lady a lot of shit like that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 fill it in the joints of the pieces 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.540
 I do not know if you see it well because it's black 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.030
 but this clearer that's all dirt 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.910
 you are going to see it because taking a rag 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.370
 of cooking a napkin a handkerchief or what 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.700
 what do you want 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.640
 cleaning up on that part 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.909
 fix only with half a piece the dirt 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 Imagine leaving the whole cube as 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.590
 this causes the cube to slow down 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.590
 mix here and I tell you fluff powder 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 lubricant remains of lubricant then 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.950
 a lot of dirt builds up like cleaning it 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.020
 with a dishcloth and if the dirt 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 to the touch after cleaning it to the touch 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.720
 it has to be like drier if we notice 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 to a dirty one we can use a droplet in the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.580
 napkin a drop of alcohol but 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.700
 without abusing because it can be bad for him 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.740
 juice well also for where it is more 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.259
 difficult to get here we have a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.440
 ear swab that I believe 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.960
 that can serve very well for these 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.420
 places for example where we get 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.080
 also the napkin and when cleaning the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.610
 another side so you can see also 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.150
 how much dirt comes out fix what I've 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.629
 recovered here this is pure oil 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.879
 also look at the center piece that 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.880
 of the other pieces is like a mini 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.540
 dirt 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.230
 look almost nothing and I have here a good 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.070
 I work with this cube. 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 say that when I finish cleaning it 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.010
 I managed not to lubricate it and then 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.530
 we wait a bit to make a few sun 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.320
 without lubricant because it is good for 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.080
 remember sensations and compare it later 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.380
 with the lubricant and it's also good 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.980
 for the juice I think the pieces 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.980
 come into friction between them 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.900
 wear a little and I think it's good 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.300
 before pouring the lubricant and then 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.640
 Well, the typical lubricants 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.860
 marough loop that you know is very good 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.140
 but that lasts a little at least the same 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.900
 you hold on version 2 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.940
 this is the waylon by the way or if not 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.600
 these lubricants that I have in format 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:22.040
 so kubik led syringe 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.380
 viscosity 4 viscosity 1 lighter 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.450
 there is of all kinds what is important is that 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.110
 leave the bucket very clean from time to time 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.020
 When you have to clean up, you have to put on 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.740
 handsome and take a little cologne 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.810
 but you know cologne, not all of them 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.060
 the days do not have to abuse is good 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.380
 cuberos and I hope you liked the 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.340
 video and especially that is very useful 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.340
 see you later
