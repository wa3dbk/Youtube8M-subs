00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 hey people in welcome to one 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.049
 another episode of ultimate team 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.460
 roulette episode number eleven today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.230
 already so we are already relatively far 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.820
 even advanced 90 already 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.650
 Team chemistry is a very good one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
 worth but of course we wanted that too 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.969
 Keep it up so we have come and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
 perfect this value to 100 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.390
 that would be desirable the first opponent 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 We quickly found what we were looking for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.279
 received today in our stadium and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.109
 I do not know what it is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 So it should be good games though 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.010
 maybe ramos has maybe five 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.830
 chemistry so wrong position plus too little 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 left on board not completely emi 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.010
 blasczykowski normal case not so well 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 I do not know what he can do with it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 Anyway, wanted a good team 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.200
 but a little bit emi what yes in ultimate 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.460
 team very very important is the first one 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.079
 chance had the same direction again 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.399
 middle conclusion but we keep coming 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.989
 no problem today the corner dangerous 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.899
 in the middle there is rio ferdinand the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.250
 old man and barzagli but only there 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.809
 with can now unfortunately times parry 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.579
 continue to play 1 in one direction only 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 palace in the middle and there is hernandez 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.969
 chicharito but what is he doing? 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.350
 Do you want to do something very nice with 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.160
 the fallback and then it works 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.690
 thing clearly over it 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.760
 It would not have been necessary to do that, though 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 what's up palacio then with features like 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.790
 can completely place through the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.409
 ward off by wandering without him too 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.909
 Thus, once attacked no 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 difficult game for him one to zero 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.979
 by 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.119
 I mean, if you leave him that free 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.830
 then of course you have to do it with it 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.200
 expect that you will be punished for that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.360
 is just foolish and therefore the 100th 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 baroque later one to one what please 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.689
 make today's chesney with a whole 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.119
 You can also use weak action 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.380
 Keep it honest because I was good 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.970
 He is free through but the shot was 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 really not good not not placed 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.150
 strongly not where you should 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.439
 actually can hold then 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.369
 richards, however, on the right 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.750
 side still the first half 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.600
 nice flank on the long post there 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.950
 palacio is back over it the chance for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.659
 to restore their leadership 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.460
 through his second goal of the match though 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.320
 Unfortunately do not make sense because he too 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.579
 hochtief chicharito then suddenly 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.259
 completely free by the huge chance 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.360
 chicharito and that is not in there though 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.829
 at the posts and the montolivo makes 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.869
 the thing purely two to one through 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.310
 montolivo for me nice prep work too 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.570
 of chicharito albeit very indirectly 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.960
 He was actually doing it himself 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 wanted 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.399
 and unfortunately only the post hits but 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 Yet that's two to one in any case 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.939
 then, just before the half, my 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.399
 adrian ramos also good shot 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.840
 But this time Chesney is watching 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.149
 can fix something as before and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 again ibo and again it is never there 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.000
 makes it better than the 1 2 1 and can 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.430
 also keep the ball 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 quite good benefits him from him until 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.760
 this error just so currently two 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.800
 to one for me through the gates of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.540
 montolivo and ballast and thus one 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.950
 relatively good guidance around here and points 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.990
 Of course, some money for new ones 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.810
 Get transfers from this game 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.910
 already the 58 minutes suddenly completely 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.709
 free through with his pace car emerick 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.690
 aubameyang with the chance but chesney 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.780
 is there and year crowned his good 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.250
 performance and builds it in the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.270
 i can lukas labor 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.650
 not really dribble dribbles 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.660
 Nevertheless, by Lukas Weber with the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.770
 Chance blocks a lot of luck for you 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.360
 my opponent the advertising is not in it 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.100
 although labor did not shoot 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 can not and really offensive not at all 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.459
 but that was well done like that 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.860
 chicharito then completely free 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.410
 is fouled correctly red and wrong no 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.330
 foul no red that was in my eyes 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.800
 A completely clear emergency brake must be here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.970
 actually is wrong and give red 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.380
 the referee sees it again 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.360
 unlike that he from fifa unfortunately 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.500
 knows and decides to keep going 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.420
 to leave for whatever reason 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.970
 then he quotes on palacio palace yes 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.170
 not nice lupfer just over well 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.550
 done with his weak left then 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.140
 lopped the ball very close by 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.420
 bad luck for me that the ball is not in it 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.799
 again hernandez is extremely much of him 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.600
 see next chance for him though 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.100
 it's thursday again and it can be very 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.480
 good parrying can only be there with general yes 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.840
 one of the best goalkeepers in this 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.180
 game 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.530
 Now that he is here with two to one 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.060
 in the game, however, in spite of 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 this permanent pressure of me especially 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.590
 achieved by the toronto and thus 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.310
 We took the victory and some coins 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.170
 home 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.250
 from these coins resulted then that 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.170
 we could buy a new player 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.700
 eric the number 8 and that was the discount 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.019
 a left wing player in itself 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.360
 not bad because we have a left 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.549
 wing players need because there was 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.410
 palace before and the plus some more 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.950
 while amra is waiting now 3 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.959
 that's just fine 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.640
 yes, but in the end not optimal 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.410
 after all, a left wing player better 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.329
 as nothing, it was the next opponent 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.310
 had quickly found a seriati with 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:03.480
 pirlo with vidal with balotelli tevez 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.530
 cuadrado caceres yes all all sorts of good 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.940
 players especially the internal defense 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.230
 very strong a very fast player 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.209
 a fast and very strong player 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.470
 a good combination mostly but the 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.000
 first chance had one right away 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.920
 striker balotelli with the chance though 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.169
 disney star and can parry the ball 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.669
 zero to zero will continue for ten minutes 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.019
 played nice ball on but the new one 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.150
 man the new building is brought by both 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.410
 and that nani but the shot unfortunately 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.910
 not dangerous enough you could 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.500
 even discuss an eleven-meter in 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.300
 my eyes on the discounts something 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.200
 rudely picked up by the legs 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.790
 umpire did not see it that way 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.660
 thus the chance for monnet the unfortunately 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.730
 could not use 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.320
 then the connection broke off bonucci 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.820
 here I am still trying to shoot or 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.800
 But the connection breaks anyway 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.570
 The game is just eleven 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.910
 minutes past 150 coins there are 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.930
 after all, and yes from my side it came 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.340
 not as you can see here I am 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.930
 still in it is so because of an opponent 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.310
 somehow the connection I lost 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.620
 do not think that he saved now 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.410
 why did I also say it was 0 10 0 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.760
 both teams were about equally good 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.220
 would have made no sense to break off there 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.320
 so yes once again again all next 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.419
 opponents found and he too with one 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.400
 strong team namely a pr team with 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.919
 Remy star was the type of the star 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.050
 typical storm front in the cloud cloud the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.280
 young nasri ramirez the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.660
 home defense a bit weak 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.610
 Many, above all, are not physically based 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.290
 have great strength with milled and 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.300
 koscielny but still a very good one 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.070
 team first chance for me hernandez with 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.110
 the shot but there is today cech and 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.280
 can fend off to the corner again is on 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.140
 coutinho prevails in dribbling 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.520
 has plenty of space coutinho and that is 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.870
 not in post 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.280
 good luck for my opponent but 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.900
 nani again with the flank but then in 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.880
 final effect clarified good scene of 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.770
 brazilian from in services of the fc 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.840
 liverpool but unfortunately only the post 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.910
 then again with me 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.950
 chicharito and this time he meets 100 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.570
 better done than before with many 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.540
 opportunities where he often did not meet but 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.990
 Here he meets the goal to 1 0 to 38 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.729
 minutes 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.919
 nasri then here with too much space on 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.030
 Storage tries it directly 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.010
 millimeter past the gate very quite 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.260
 Good chance for him but luck is 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.400
 the ball just past the goal very nice 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.350
 made in all involved 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.120
 good luck for me again chicharito then 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.540
 Constant calmness in uneasiness Pohl im 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.419
 game 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.620
 hernandez with not the gate as well 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.120
 here again quite over more like 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.590
 already kullert of storage 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.080
 the ball just past the post 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.479
 a lot of bad luck for me nani then has too much 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.510
 place nani tries to go through nani has 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.460
 the chance makes the gate 20 here again 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.600
 very weak from the defense acted 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.700
 he just too much space 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.060
 go through loose and free and makes 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.380
 the thing easy easy pure 20 70 c again 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.090
 the said nani moves into the middle 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.590
 tried with the shot from this 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.160
 this is not really true 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.930
 that's in it 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.400
 1 pm beautiful gate of nani 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.080
 second home game 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.240
 the first one was relatively easy to do 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.710
 it's very easy for him to defend himself 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.240
 it by a terrific individual 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.009
 performance owed by him that the 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.069
 ball goes in super dribbling 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.439
 super shot 213 0 next chance then 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.369
 led the four again a bit hard 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.779
 is brought by the two 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:47.399
 But here , too , told the referees 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:47.789
 That was not a thing we let go 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.740
 to run 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.839
 in return storage good chance though 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.369
 Chesney once more on the ball great pass 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.689
 play by him this really everything 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.439
 kept with that had nothing 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.779
 oppose 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.039
 as well as louis krimi the 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:00.569
 subsequent corner, however, dangerous 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.300
 nasri in the middle there as chelny per 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.919
 head but chesney of course there 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.960
 otherwise the game is so direct 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.270
 Slow to the end to 85 nasri again 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.860
 blocked with the chance of header 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.270
 and then again world but that can 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.620
 except not running too much 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.960
 why this ball then in the end 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.569
 also with me lands 90 minutes of storage 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.550
 and who is completely really great 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:22.080
 You just have to be able to play a game of it 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.330
 you do not say anything else and thus 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.979
 also a deserved 3 10 0 victory before 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.289
 all jason worked hard through his 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.849
 top performance and yes more important victory 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.979
 important points important money especially 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.659
 also on our way to the course 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.919
 perfect team and that's it 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:36.779
 again from today's episode 

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.099
 that was mine, I hope so 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:42.499
 The next time was until then 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.499
 until then and bye bye
