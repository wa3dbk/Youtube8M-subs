murka followed by trend trend take up a
rather<00:05:56.760> large<00:05:58.310> footprint<00:05:59.310> in<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.550> show<00:06:00.140> I'm

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
rather large footprint in the show I'm

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.360 
rather large footprint in the show I'm
not<00:06:01.260> surprised<00:06:01.590> they've<00:06:01.740> got<00:06:01.860> so<00:06:02.160> many

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
not surprised they've got so many

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.240 
not surprised they've got so many
different<00:06:02.790> products<00:06:03.410> now<00:06:04.410> this<00:06:04.590> was<00:06:04.770> fun

I<00:06:06.260> suppose<00:06:07.260> this<00:06:07.560> little<00:06:07.920> tool<00:06:08.520> could<00:06:08.880> be

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
I suppose this little tool could be

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.840 
I suppose this little tool could be
useful<00:06:09.210> for<00:06:10.160> guitar<00:06:11.160> inlay<00:06:13.430> it's<00:06:14.430> not<00:06:14.610> big

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
useful for guitar inlay it's not big

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.650 
useful for guitar inlay it's not big
enough<00:06:14.880> for<00:06:15.360> a<00:06:15.570> fretboard<00:06:16.020> even<00:06:16.320> sadly<00:06:17.660> but

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
enough for a fretboard even sadly but

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.480
