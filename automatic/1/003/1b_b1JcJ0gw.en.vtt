00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.800
 The producer is an Italian company called Mammon . 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:23.960

 The air company to brand the opportunity now and make the grandson to light that 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.809
 He said he got inspired talking about it . 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:43.489
 Yes, so I released it today from my sister-in-law 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.489
 It's a desk stand that's just like any other . 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.109
 I'll talk to you first about the components. 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.530
 Once the power is on, the power cable contains one and that is the adapter 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:58.159
 Adapter adapter is not just black 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 This half is half white color is built around two servants of these three minutes 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.040
 Now its size on the inside as on the menu for the power under control so 105 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.020
 &amp; See 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.260
 I can see the logo now. There's a very unique logo. 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:17.000
 And the actual product tree like this 4 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.990
 I have an Extend, too . 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.340
 There are types and sheep Amuretoganimini There are opponents and large size 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.660
 I have a mini size, but I have a bigger size in the middle. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.830
 It's really big. Now it's coming out on both sides of our background. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.950
 It's very big. 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:41.480
 And here's a circle with a circle of light, here is the logo of the door. 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.380
 And again, this is another part of this circle , the middle part. 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.460
 Here you can adjust the angle while turning, and below that 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.600
 Circle 1 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.920
 The base is a base part of information required enacted Ugg Now switch or now 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.420
 By touch 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.110
 The control switch or a doeguyo or are now connected to the power cable, and I proceed 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.330
 The base is attached to the adapter to connect the part 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:11.090
 So we'll components have a very simple cable adapters world series 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.200
 It contains three total 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.770
 Once the product itself stand 90 to the middle button 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.030
 Turn it on and off, 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:30.069
 The erection of lighting as a search 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.610
 I can adjust the brightness of the lighting i total 10 steps 1 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.840
 Level 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.709
 It is said that it is possible to control the adjustment, but there are not many LEDs 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.750
 And 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:47.060
 Whatever my situation because I know that I wear and also sell fine 2-up 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.810
 The biggest advantage is that you can adjust the lighting accordingly. 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.049
 Guys it's moving the world title three joint application 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.410
 Once in the base 1 in the middle 1 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:03.260
 Now , it says that it's going to be a year away from the light emitting part. 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:07.880
 Gun control is very unique designer rattling bass is now the n Trinity 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.510
 Symbolism and this and paw study symbolize the sun, the moon and the earth 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.780
 I will 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.230
 So , at the same time , 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.600
 And once in the middle 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:25.459
 In addition, we know how to fully rotate in large widths at one time very Eun Kyung 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.500
 I thought so, but not so far, it was a little mid-width, 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.900
 And in the last light 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.790
 Here, in the second syllable containing dog anthem 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:41.209
 I can give you a big boost . 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:46.609
 It 's possible to turn 180 degrees left and right. 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:51.290
 What went down at about a 45 degree neck kkeokyeotda still possible that watching 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:56.930
 I have to adjust the angle of my mind to give the height 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.500
 I can not control my brightness until I'm a very big 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.060
 I think the little guy has to start from the design unique 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:10.010
 I thought that it was not a bad product. 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.849
 It is easy to use even when working with the application mode . 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.430
 I just wrote a darker easily stand on two eojeon than my old one it 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:22.430
 It's dark now, so much more 8 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.270
 Increasing the water look good and get an erection so you can catch well geureongeot look for work 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.000
 Let's do it 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.680
 It looks very good. It's different from my previous version. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.370
 I want to be on the stand a lot. 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.250
 Uh, well, you can not adjust the brightness anyway . 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.360
 I know it's not good, but I can not control the brightness . 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.810
 Besides, I just know that the button is not pressed and turned off. 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:52.849
 I know you can only adjust the angle up and down. 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:57.590
 I think it is a more comfortable stand to use than that. 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:05:01.400
 The company will recommend the company side of the company to do something precise 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.870
 It is very good for those who work at the desk 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.190
 I was explaining. 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.960
 In making the product according to a baseball've Proud job again. Oh Snow 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:16.460
 I think it's a little less painful and then you'll be able to. 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:20.810
 I've been reviewing the stand for some time today. 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:25.250
 If you think of frozen eye health and design, 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.819
 If you think that you would need a much more luxurious stand 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.880
 silver 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:34.130
 I think that it is appropriate product. 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.640
 In the same case yesterday, the lead-free sesame seeds reached me and I was to make a review like this. 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.280
 5 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.610
 I think this is not a bad idea even more than you think, especially the scandal 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.020
 Listen to the brightness control switch like 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:53.150
 Here then today is those who have used examples zest back crossed until lunch 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.150
