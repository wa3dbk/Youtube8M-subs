 Hello Sarah Petrovsky first 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.820
 Today we will tell how to enter quotas for 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.150
 staff cars are locked 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.150
 radio cassette player 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.260
 in anybody stopped early this volcano code 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.170
 service book you got 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.730
 together with the car now I will tell you how 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.099
 this is done in practice 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.930
 First of all, you need to make sure that 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.289
 yours was not blocked if 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.449
 after switching on you hear the sound 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:38.040
 signal 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.990
 which is consistent 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.680
 distributed from all speakers 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.860
 this is your choice 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830
 while the tape recorder continues to work in 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.930
 regular mode can play music which 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.490
 accompanied by this very 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.800
 repetitive signal 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.630
 about two three minutes after 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.870
 the inclusion of the sbu will stop yes and nato 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.230
 a tape recorder screen will appear 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.870
 an invitation to keep that code he 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.800
 consists of four digits 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.900
 the copy we need is specified in the service 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.730
 the book on the second page is down in 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.580
 In this case, it is 07 06 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730
 Here you can use the number keys 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.410
 located on the front panel 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.570
 radio cassette player 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.850
 the first digit of the code corresponds to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.860
 keys 1 second digit 2 third digit 3 well 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.110
 fourth respectively 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.420
 Key 4, select the required numbers inside 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.890
 The code is repeated by pressing on 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.950
 corresponding key for example 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.020
 the second digit in our code is from the series 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.830
 mean we have to press deuce then 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.050
 number of times for the screen to appear 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.330
 number 7 if you flew over and by chance 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.640
 clicked more times nothing 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.740
 scary 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 figure go around from zero to nine 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.340
 similarly pressing the 4 key 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 choose number 6 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 m 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.670
 2 now we have the opposite 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.929
 the same thing that's just those 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.549
 in confirmation of the plan introduced 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.809
 press and hold key 6 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.039
 if you did everything correctly distributed 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.829
 beep and cassette transition in 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.449
 normal operation 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.489
 if under was entered incorrectly 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.439
 retry will be prompted 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.689
 lamp after 90 seconds 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.199
 I hope that our instructions will be given to you 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.400
 helpful all the best
