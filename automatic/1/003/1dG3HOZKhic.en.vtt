now<00:02:09.550> because<00:02:09.700> I'm<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:09.940> my<00:02:10.090> small<00:02:10.509> little

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
now because I'm in my small little

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.300 
now because I'm in my small little
studio<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:12.069> am<00:02:13.060> running<00:02:13.739> exceedingly<00:02:14.739> low<00:02:15.010> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
studio I am running exceedingly low and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
studio I am running exceedingly low and
it's<00:02:15.610> still<00:02:15.940> really<00:02:16.060> low<00:02:16.270> you'll<00:02:16.569> hear<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:16.840> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it's still really low you'll hear in a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.920 
it's still really low you'll hear in a
second<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:18.069> have<00:02:18.280> your<00:02:18.670> shape<00:02:19.090> which<00:02:19.390> that's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
second you have your shape which that's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.740 
second you have your shape which that's
basically<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.910> kind<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.180> base<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.540> want

right there when it clips on the front
end<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.080> cabinet<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.680> cannot<00:03:06.069> really<00:03:06.250> see

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
end of the cabinet you cannot really see

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.440 
end of the cabinet you cannot really see
it<00:03:06.730> too<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.900> basically<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:10.090> a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it too well but basically this is a

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.060 
it too well but basically this is a
front<00:03:10.840> load<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.079> cabinet<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.590> an<00:03:11.680> 18-2

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
front load of cabinet you have an 18-2

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.890 
front load of cabinet you have an 18-2
offer<00:03:12.280> right<00:03:12.459> there<00:03:12.640> with<00:03:13.269> like<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.570> said<00:03:13.870> a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
offer right there with like I said a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.440 
offer right there with like I said a
four-inch<00:03:14.829> voice<00:03:15.130> coil<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:16.299> thing

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
four-inch voice coil and this thing

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.830 
four-inch voice coil and this thing
could<00:03:16.570> pound<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.290> main<00:03:18.280> reason<00:03:18.489> why<00:03:18.940> an<00:03:19.450> 18

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
could pound and main reason why an 18

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.630 
could pound and main reason why an 18
inch<00:03:19.959> woofer<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.470> such<00:03:20.680> deep<00:03:21.040> bass<00:03:21.310> is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
inch woofer can have such deep bass is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.740 
inch woofer can have such deep bass is
out<00:03:21.910> down<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.660> all<00:03:22.780> ear<00:03:22.989> space<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
out down here it's all ear space for the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.449 
out down here it's all ear space for the
sound<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.870> resonate<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.530> get<00:03:27.010> louder<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.400> you

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
sound to resonate and get louder so you

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.229 
sound to resonate and get louder so you
the<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:28.390> whole<00:03:28.859> comb<00:03:29.859> section<00:03:30.459> off<00:03:30.609> here<00:03:31.060> and

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
the the whole comb section off here and

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.229 
the the whole comb section off here and
then<00:03:31.359> you<00:03:31.480> have<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:32.410> deep<00:03:32.790> resonating<00:03:33.790> space

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
then you have the deep resonating space

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.500 
then you have the deep resonating space
down<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.510> which<00:03:35.200> ideally<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:36.700> makes<00:03:36.970> for<00:03:37.480> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
down here which ideally this makes for a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.160 
down here which ideally this makes for a
very<00:03:37.569> very<00:03:38.170> nice<00:03:38.650> sub<00:03:38.920> configuration<00:03:39.989> ok<00:03:40.989> so

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
very very nice sub configuration ok so

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.960 
very very nice sub configuration ok so
right<00:03:41.440> now<00:03:41.620> um<00:03:42.040> you're<00:03:42.459> gonna<00:03:42.549> get<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.760> better

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
right now um you're gonna get a better

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.849 
right now um you're gonna get a better
sample<00:03:43.269> for<00:03:43.569> how<00:03:43.660> loud<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:44.079> can<00:03:44.260> really<00:03:44.470> get

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
sample for how loud this can really get

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.479 
sample for how loud this can really get
um<00:03:45.239> tomorrow<00:03:46.239> at<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.420> gig<00:03:46.600> but<00:03:46.890> tonight<00:03:47.890> I'm
