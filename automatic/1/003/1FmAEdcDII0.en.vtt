00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
board for a minute the idea was to do is

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.249 
board for a minute the idea was to do is
go<00:00:11.130> through<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.639> then<00:00:11.910> holy<00:00:12.450> pull<00:00:12.870> each<00:00:13.049> one

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
go through and then holy pull each one

go through and then holy pull each one
out<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.620> go<00:00:13.940> TDM<00:00:14.940> should<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.839> keep<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.139> well

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.960 
out and go TDM should we keep it well
let's<00:00:16.770> talk<00:00:16.949> about<00:00:17.100> why<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.580> should<00:00:17.730> keep<00:00:17.820> it

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970

let's talk about why we should keep it
TDM<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.539> pretty<00:00:18.750> easy<00:00:18.779> okay<00:00:19.650> put<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.010> back

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189

TDM was pretty easy okay put that back
so<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.880> did<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
so that's what we did that with all the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.000 
so that's what we did that with all the
game<00:00:21.630> Rosie<00:00:21.869> said<00:00:22.020> okay<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.560> game<00:00:22.830> mode

yes<00:00:23.640> no<00:00:23.880> maybe<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.330> tried<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.170> cut<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.680> many<00:00:25.800> as

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
yes no maybe and tried to cut as many as

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
yes no maybe and tried to cut as many as
we<00:00:26.039> possibly<00:00:26.160> could<00:00:26.519> they<00:00:26.849> still<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.689> put

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
we possibly could they still can be put

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.269 
we possibly could they still can be put
back<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> game<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.130> they're

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
back into the game it's not like they're

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.640 
back into the game it's not like they're
gone<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:30.300> playlist<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.260> update<00:00:31.410> them

tomorrow and they'll be something
completely<00:00:33.270> different<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.809> idea<00:00:34.079> was

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
completely different the idea was

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.889 
completely different the idea was
especially<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.370> launch<00:00:35.610> anyways<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
especially for launch anyways is to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.040 
especially for launch anyways is to
introduce<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:39.059> game<00:00:39.300> modes<00:00:39.540> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and rescue and then creates a prototype

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
and rescue and then creates a prototype
for<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.710> sometimes<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.549> super

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
for it sometimes that's super

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
for it sometimes that's super
straightforward<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.810> easy<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.350> search<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
straightforward and easy like search and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.960 
straightforward and easy like search and
rescue<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.189> straightforward<00:01:14.400> didn't

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
rescue is pretty straightforward didn't

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
rescue is pretty straightforward didn't
take<00:01:15.090> too<00:01:15.299> long<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.560> quickly<00:01:16.560> script<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.950> up

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
take too long to quickly script that up

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
take too long to quickly script that up
then<00:01:17.549> introduced<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.390> funny<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
then introduced it the funny thing is is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
then introduced it the funny thing is is
with<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.500> these<00:01:19.740> modes<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.520> end<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.790> playing

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
with all these modes we end up playing

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
with all these modes we end up playing
in<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:22.590> previous<00:01:22.890> games<00:01:23.159> maps<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.090> yeah<00:01:24.299> we

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
in the previous games maps but yeah we

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
in the previous games maps but yeah we
taught<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.780> try<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.470> every<00:01:25.920> game

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
taught what we try to do is every game

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760 
taught what we try to do is every game
is<00:01:26.430> keep<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.450> maps<00:01:27.659> alive<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
is keep some maps alive from the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.560 
is keep some maps alive from the
previous<00:01:29.040> game<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.790> test<00:01:30.090> maps<00:01:30.299> and

the Canaries you know and what we do is
we<00:01:39.270> play<00:01:39.689> test<00:01:39.990> multiplayer<00:01:40.650> pretty<00:01:41.310> much

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
we play test multiplayer pretty much

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.270 
we play test multiplayer pretty much
from<00:01:41.520> day<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:41.970> every<00:01:42.869> night<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.439> every<00:01:44.100> night

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
from day one every night so every night

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
from day one every night so every night
for<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:45.000> an<00:01:45.149> hour<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.630> hour<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> half

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
for about an hour to an hour and a half

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
for about an hour to an hour and a half
we<00:01:46.649> play<00:01:46.829> multiplayer<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> whole<00:01:47.790> team

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
we play multiplayer not the whole team

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
we play multiplayer not the whole team
but<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.600> small<00:01:48.899> portion<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> team<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.829> we

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
but a small portion of the team so we

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.350 
but a small portion of the team so we
might<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.220> two<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:50.520> three<00:01:50.670> games<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
might get two or three games going and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630 
might get two or three games going and
then<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:52.259> becomes<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> pitch<00:01:53.250> meeting<00:01:53.579> in

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
then that's becomes the pitch meeting in

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
then that's becomes the pitch meeting in
a<00:01:53.700> sense<00:01:53.909> afterwards<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.590> group<00:01:55.799> up

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
a sense afterwards we have we group up

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.590 
a sense afterwards we have we group up
and<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.219> discuss<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.420> did

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and we go discuss what we just did

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.569 
and we go discuss what we just did
discuss<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> play<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.430> like

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
discuss the play you know I really like

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.510 
discuss the play you know I really like
the<00:01:59.700> way<00:02:00.350> search<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.409> rescue<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> can

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the way search and rescue that you can

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
the way search and rescue that you can
revive<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> way<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.409> doing<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
revive but we need a way of doing that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.520 
revive but we need a way of doing that
like<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.969> tag<00:02:06.540> idea<00:02:06.899> wasn't<00:02:07.140> necessarily

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
like the the tag idea wasn't necessarily

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
like the the tag idea wasn't necessarily
the<00:02:07.680> first<00:02:07.890> thing<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.190> came<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.330> they

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the first thing that came up then they

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.760 
the first thing that came up then they
would<00:02:09.599> say<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.869> well<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.560> player

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
would say like well what if the player

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.220 
would say like well what if the player
drops<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.280> tag<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.910> that's<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
drops a tag and that's how you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500 
drops a tag and that's how you
revive<00:02:13.920> somebody<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.610> oh<00:02:14.730> okay<00:02:15.060> well<00:02:15.239> let's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
revive somebody like oh okay well let's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.149 
revive somebody like oh okay well let's
try<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.050> if<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.379> go<00:02:16.500> back<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.830> desks

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
try that so if they go back to the desks

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.979 
try that so if they go back to the desks
they<00:02:17.310> should<00:02:18.150> make<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.330> change<00:02:18.690> then

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
they should make that change then

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.280 
they should make that change then
tomorrow<00:02:19.409> we<00:02:20.159> play<00:02:20.190> again<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.209> it's<00:02:21.330> got<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
tomorrow we play again but it's got the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
tomorrow we play again but it's got the
tag<00:02:22.470> dropping<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.220> then<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.760> comments

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
tag dropping thing then more comments

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.460 
tag dropping thing then more comments
and<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.390> changes<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> changes<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.349> changes

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
and it changes and changes and changes

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.990 
and it changes and changes and changes
so<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> idea<00:02:26.340> gets<00:02:27.150> molded<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.560> time<00:02:29.040> until

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so the idea gets molded over time until

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.390 
so the idea gets molded over time until
it's<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.720> yep<00:02:31.019> this<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.470> good<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.160> very

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
it's like yep this is good it's a very

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.449 
it's like yep this is good it's a very
organic<00:02:32.910> yet<00:02:33.330> overly<00:02:33.959> thorough<00:02:34.349> process<00:02:34.739> we

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
organic yet overly thorough process we

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.339 
organic yet overly thorough process we
cut<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.910> lot<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.420> than<00:02:36.720> maybe<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.140> ship

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
cut a lot more than maybe we ship

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.800 
cut a lot more than maybe we ship
sometimes<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.040> feel<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:38.940> ghosts<00:02:39.329> we

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
sometimes I feel like with ghosts we

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.390 
sometimes I feel like with ghosts we
didn't<00:02:40.549> bloat<00:02:41.549> we<00:02:42.239> cut<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> lot<00:02:43.319> our<00:02:43.950> fans<00:02:44.129> going

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400

didn't bloat we cut a lot our fans going
to<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.730> some<00:02:45.629> people<00:02:45.870> won't<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.470> know

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
to like that some people won't you know

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.839 
to like that some people won't you know
all<00:02:46.890> right<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.099> we<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.670> know<00:02:47.819> that

this needed to be its own new game we
wanted<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.030> let<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.239> game<00:02:57.480> grow<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.470> its<00:02:58.500> own

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
wanted to let this game grow on its own

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
duty games we were a little too serious

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.659 
duty games we were a little too serious
on<00:03:34.109> multiplayer<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.650> we're<00:03:35.280> concentrating

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
on multiplayer and we're concentrating

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.099 
on multiplayer and we're concentrating
too<00:03:36.090> much<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.359> making<00:03:36.630> sure<00:03:36.750> everything<00:03:37.019> was

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
too much on making sure everything was

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.319 
too much on making sure everything was
super<00:03:37.560> competitive<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.459> for<00:03:39.090> modern

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
super competitive and then for modern

super competitive and then for modern
warfare<00:03:39.450> 3<00:03:39.859> we<00:03:40.859> introduced<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.400> idea<00:03:41.579> of

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
warfare 3 we introduced this idea of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.270 
warfare 3 we introduced this idea of
community<00:03:42.419> playlists<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.500> community<00:03:44.099> maps

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
community playlists and community maps

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.490 
community playlists and community maps
and<00:03:44.549> community<00:03:44.940> sort<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.180> modes<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.810> that's

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
and community sort of modes and that's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.809 
and community sort of modes and that's
where<00:03:47.190> some<00:03:48.090> people's<00:03:48.450> ideas<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:49.109> of<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:50.700> know

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
where some people's ideas of of you know

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.589 
where some people's ideas of of you know
an<00:03:51.000> infected<00:03:51.540> mode<00:03:51.750> or<00:03:53.030> drop<00:03:54.030> zone<00:03:54.269> or

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
an infected mode or drop zone or

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.180 
an infected mode or drop zone or
something<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.019> those<00:03:55.410> kind<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.859> modes

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
something like that those kind of modes

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.599 
something like that those kind of modes
came<00:03:57.180> from<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.510> idea<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.840> with<00:03:58.829> community

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
came from the idea that with community

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.470 
came from the idea that with community
modes<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.780> we<00:04:01.290> have<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> place<00:04:01.980> for<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:03.269> not

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
modes that we have a place for the not

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.559 
modes that we have a place for the not
serious<00:04:04.109> non-competitive<00:04:05.120> modes<00:04:06.120> so

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
serious non-competitive modes so

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.920 
serious non-competitive modes so
infected<00:04:07.079> is<00:04:07.319> not<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.819> competitive<00:04:08.819> mode<00:04:09.060> but

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
infected is not a competitive mode but

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.140 
infected is not a competitive mode but
it's<00:04:10.049> fun<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.680> think<00:04:10.919> that<00:04:11.099> that<00:04:11.549> has<00:04:11.579> been

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
it's fun and I think that that has been

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.210 
it's fun and I think that that has been
a<00:04:12.389> drive<00:04:12.690> for<00:04:12.930> us<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.319> last<00:04:13.500> few<00:04:13.709> games<00:04:13.889> is

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
a drive for us in the last few games is

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.909 
a drive for us in the last few games is
let's<00:04:15.090> not<00:04:15.449> worry<00:04:16.169> about<00:04:16.320> whether<00:04:16.680> or<00:04:16.799> not

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919

let's not worry about whether or not
this<00:04:17.130> game<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:17.880> fair<00:04:18.630> competitively<00:04:19.560> let's

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
this game is fair competitively let's

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.909 
this game is fair competitively let's
