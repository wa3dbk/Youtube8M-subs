 hello very good to all friends how are you 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.279
 you are the minister- 7rm and we are in a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.860
 new video once again one a boxing of 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.510
 the tea set there via yearly this time 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.430
 we are in video and you what fifteen 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.800
 As you know this year I did not buy the 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.360
 playstation3 edition because the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.340
 first version of playstation 4 was 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.470
 much better although we see they have removed 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.949
 many modes is still a game 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.629
 incredible respect to graphics regarding 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.820
 game modes that is to say has taken us away 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.040
 a game mode some kind of combat 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.110
 the argument mode and all that but the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.269
 graphics the gameplay has changed and 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.250
 it seems much more real much more playable 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.769
 so I really wanted to have 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.180
 this game and encourage you to buy what 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.890
 I'm going to start uploading videos from now 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.739
 same since you see this a boxing that 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.860
 what the engraving just when I saw it I 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.710
 they have brought so much desire to 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.909
 put me to record jumplist and they are four 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.560
 although the videos are going to occupy a lot 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.750
 more but I think it's worth it 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.040
 it's sad because it's amazing the graphics 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.560
 I also want to record start to start 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.990
 record at 60 fps is because I believe 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.450
 that we are going to have a great time in this 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.580
 new season campaign to say it 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.990
 some way to tamiu video 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.330
 so let's go to it let's go with the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.050
 boxing 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.810
 You see I have a sting reserved 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.770

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.960
 the price of the games of 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.560

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.430
 minister wikis and here we see the new 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.310
 graphics that are water that I before we go 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.440
 to try to open this is to use the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.820
 mouth 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:16.110

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.750
 without seeing the codes because 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.730

 start recording because I feel like 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.230
 because I want to adapt to this new 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.459

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.629
