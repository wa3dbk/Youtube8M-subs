00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 the team and yves opening packs and more 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.830
 It's Easter 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 I really have very, very good players 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 finally for the episode for this episode of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
 not much but for the next 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.489
 episode you'll see that it's 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.320
 really huge players 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.450
 you could see that I cut too 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.550
 between the times when I have to confirm to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.590
 and purchasing and opening the package so 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.940
 that these episodes I guess I want 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.920
 to do yet where about 3.4 I know 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.690
 not at all because I actually 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 opens with microsoft points that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 I buy myself at home 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.480
 and finally me I said cheaper I 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.520
 did not say 25 euros like everything in the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.549
 supermarkets and at micromania and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.860
 where I want about 13 euros 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.049
 ensure my life as a good team occupants 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.610
 the team is he I have my team of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.110
 barclays I'm almost done it myself 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.369
 missing more than a few players I know 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.140
 I did not do a lot of episodes 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 so it's probably sorry to have you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 like a lot of episodes I do not know what 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.280
 that I'm going to do I think I'm going 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.490
 to win all couples at all 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.560
 trophies de dÃ©tourna ultimate team 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.689
 as you can see I do not have much 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.009
 good players is good in the next 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.189
 pack you'll see that I would have 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.600
 really great players during the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.689
 next pack in the next episode 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.560
 I liked a player who told me 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.369
 extremely helpful for my typical team 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.320
 I will not tell you that they 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.579
 think it'll spoil the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 surprise and it's really a very very 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 good game that if I tell you to do a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.780
 dedication to crazy rybak who loves 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.759
 opening pack utilities i have it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.930
 looks really like that I like 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.110
 make videos like that because he 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.340
 is 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.780
 what I know who will already have a 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 person well so it would 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 nice to him to watch food so 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.870
 when you could see I have a 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600
 new intro a new intro that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 was made by jicks it's a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.319
 graphist there you could see I had a 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 day to booster pitroipa 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.840
 it's a player who plays bloodshed at 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.560
 against the speed 94 anyway I even 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.400
 sell the 12012 bet even well 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.600
 if the general is here and not too much who has 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.000
 been done by jicks damian me so I 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.290
 want to thank him 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.120
 so I think that's the one that's 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.670
 the last pack where I know in a year there 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.900
 is in the note right after excuse me 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.700
 there if I 'm cold so I do not know 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.160
 if it sounds good but I'm still 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.440
 dream about it and yes always 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.989
 so right now the room a try of 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.340
 farid French team that is to say with 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.510
 hybrid that is to say with left of 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.709
 players of the teams of France and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.630
 right of league team players 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.120
 1 so it will be a team and hybrids 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.950
 league 1 in France 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.250
 I try to do the best with 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.420
 good players like manga bc bat 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.450
 valbuena past the best players who 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.329
 is that they are in league 1 and is in 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.860
