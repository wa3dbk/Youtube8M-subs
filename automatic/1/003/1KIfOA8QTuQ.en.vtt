as<00:01:36.329> well<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.600> use<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:37.439> tool<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.040> Windows

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
as well just use what tool that Windows

as well just use what tool that Windows
gives<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> software<00:01:40.560> itself

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
gives you now if the software itself

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830 
gives you now if the software itself
seems<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.759> powerful<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.509> easier

for you to use by all means stick with
it<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:46.979> recommendation<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.700> you're

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it but my recommendation if you're

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.080 
it but my recommendation if you're
asking<00:01:48.150> out<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.740> tried<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.520> rely<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
asking out right I I tried to rely on

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.389 
asking out right I I tried to rely on
third-party<00:01:51.450> software<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:53.220> as

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
third-party software as little as

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.210 
third-party software as little as
possible<00:01:53.570> because<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:55.409> always<00:01:55.920> been<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
possible because it's always been the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.770 
possible because it's always been the
case<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:57.060> hardware<00:01:58.049> manufacturers<00:01:58.920> just

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
case that hardware manufacturers just

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
case that hardware manufacturers just
inherently<00:02:00.780> can't<00:02:01.680> develop<00:02:02.280> software<00:02:02.670> they

software sucks and there's tons of

you know if you're you're having

you know if you're you're having

problem<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.050> may<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.290> software<00:02:23.740> problem<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
problem it may be a software problem and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.060 
problem it may be a software problem and
in<00:02:24.430> eliminating<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.600> extra<00:02:26.260> layer<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.830> may

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
in eliminating that extra layer you may

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.190 
in eliminating that extra layer you may
be<00:02:27.130> well<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.120> guess<00:02:28.390> eliminating<00:02:29.110> your

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
be well I guess eliminating your

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.740 
be well I guess eliminating your
potential<00:02:29.650> problem<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.670> that's<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.450> guess

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
potential problem so that's a I guess

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.240 
potential problem so that's a I guess
that's<00:02:31.960> my<00:02:32.110> perspective<00:02:32.740> but<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.100> don't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
that's my perspective but if you don't

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.980 
that's my perspective but if you don't
use<00:02:33.400> those<00:02:33.550> features<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.240> worthless<00:02:34.540> oh<00:02:34.900> you

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
use those features it's worthless oh you

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.960 
use those features it's worthless oh you
must<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.380> talking<00:02:35.470> about<00:02:35.880> something<00:02:36.880> specific
