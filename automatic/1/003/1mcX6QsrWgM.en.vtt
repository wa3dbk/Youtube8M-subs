00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.940
 and so proceed to the installation panel 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.959
 everything is done very simply here I mean 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.019
 already pinned down i arranged too 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.129
 plate it means put the panel 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.310
 exactly the frame 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:27.009
 retracts screwdriver or drill, and thus 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.449
 way screwed here the same thing 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.450
 tie here if st-pier can 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:37.719
 steppler snapping well since 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.719
 I do not have so much I did a drill 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:48.559
 the next panel means we also set 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:51.649
 we set tight saved chase and up 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:57.170
 fasten and naturally have 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.969
 cut ventilation means these joints 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.129
 just do a swarm joint someone 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.170
 nothing needs to be customized as later 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.140
 it will all get decorative 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.479
 corner all here and so begin 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.479
 close it up for now 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.450
 Well, the main work is all done 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.600
 the frames are sewn with panels like this 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.600
 looks like 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.640
 put the hatch so here it looks 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:36.710
 counter screen so put 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:42.340
 hatch here here so it opens there 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.340
 hot water meter brought out the liner for 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 . 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.509
 so that the joints of the junction, I close this 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.350
 corner 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.119
 It was sold the same as the panel and 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.810
 he bends in different directions if needed 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.500
 the inner corner is folded inward and removed 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.340
 We need external I drink out of his 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.100
 I will stick on liquid nails 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 so it will look and closed 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.620
 vertical angles and I do not put 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.269
 why because first you need to do 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.330
 ceiling 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.910
 put the ceiling plinth and already these 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.360
 corners are adjacent plinth Well 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.700
 what is this angle like that angle 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.000
 turned out here, too, will be the outer corner 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 so it all closes but yes yes it's all 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:50.180
 I will put after after the ceiling 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:56.360
 This is how it all looks very comfortable. 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:00.640
 attach the lamppost a little place 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.550
 takes about one centimeter 17 on 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.200
 budget option frame say so to me 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:14.450
 like this way to strengthen the panels 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.940
 This is how it looks like this from this. 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.660
 side on this side it remains to us that 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.980
 it remains to put this door and 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.310
 accordingly make an adjunction here 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:38.030
 I will show all this how I will do 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:42.490
 further here such a toilet turns out like u 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.490
 my idea suits me the result 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.410
 Now I would like to show how I cut 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.980
 panels can be cut different 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.790
 ways you can cut with a knife 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.080
 cut with a hacksaw with small can be cut 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:07.040
 grinder I cut the panels like this 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.870
 knife do some things we measure 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.700
 the length 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:28.040
 for example, I put a saint to make it 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:32.050
 there was a wave of visas getting absolutely 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.420
 perfect weight on both sides 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.700
 the panel now I will show how to cut 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.630
 corner decorative criminal case too 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.290
 closes and 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.570
 the junction area is very well cut 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:52.460
 scissors for metal 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:55.630
 gorgeous cut very smooth 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.590
 almost perfect cut is obtained 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:03.850
 still such nuance means when you bend 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.550
 outer corner is bent normally 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.190
 bends normally when you bend 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.470
 the inner corner if you immediately bend 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.230
 the inner corner is often that simple 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.850
 the corner breaks here preferably first 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:22.370
 bend the outer corner like this and then 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.159
 unfold and gently fold it into 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.740
 the inner 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:30.340
 like that then he is smoothly coordinated and not 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.650
 breaks well in general, that's what I wanted 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.650
 say such nuances
