don't know but there's nothing I can see

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.220 
don't know but there's nothing I can see
on<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.550> back<00:00:39.699> of<00:00:39.910> this<00:00:39.970> thing<00:00:40.239> it's<00:00:40.600> basically

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
on the back of this thing it's basically

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.770 
on the back of this thing it's basically
just<00:00:41.820> stupid<00:00:42.820> because<00:00:43.059> now<00:00:43.180> I'm<00:00:43.330> either<00:00:43.449> stuck

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
just stupid because now I'm either stuck

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.340 
just stupid because now I'm either stuck
with<00:00:43.930> this<00:00:44.050> design<00:00:44.470> or<00:00:45.339> I<00:00:45.850> got<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:46.900> go<00:00:47.019> get<00:00:47.199> an

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
with this design or I got to go get an

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.020 
with this design or I got to go get an
exact<00:00:47.739> replica<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.550> this<00:00:48.670> one's<00:00:48.820> out<00:00:48.940> of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
exact replica and this one's out of

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.400 
exact replica and this one's out of
production<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:49.750> there's<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:49.989> few<00:00:50.140> floating

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
production so there's a few floating

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.140 
production so there's a few floating
around<00:00:50.559> in<00:00:50.800> eBay<00:00:51.129> but<00:00:51.519> I<00:00:51.730> don't<00:00:51.879> really<00:00:52.000> even

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
around in eBay but I don't really even

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.790 
around in eBay but I don't really even
like<00:00:52.269> this<00:00:52.540> design<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:52.960> kind<00:00:53.470> of<00:00:53.500> like<00:00:53.650> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
like this design I kind of like the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.160 
like this design I kind of like the
fishbone<00:00:54.280> look<00:00:55.149> better<00:00:55.420> which<00:00:55.719> looks<00:00:55.960> more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
fishbone look better which looks more

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.139 
fishbone look better which looks more
like<00:00:56.289> this<00:00:56.469> one<00:00:56.680> this<00:00:57.399> one<00:00:57.610> isn't<00:00:57.879> as<00:00:57.969> nice

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
like this one this one isn't as nice

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.000 
like this one this one isn't as nice
quality<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.899> a<00:00:58.989> knockoff<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.980> I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
quality it's just a knockoff that I

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.209 
quality it's just a knockoff that I
found<00:01:00.309> on<00:01:00.489> on<00:01:01.480> eBay<00:01:01.989> for<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.289> couple<00:01:02.559> bucks<00:01:02.739> but

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
found on on eBay for a couple bucks but

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.660 
found on on eBay for a couple bucks but
I'm<00:01:03.820> gonna<00:01:04.059> take<00:01:04.330> this<00:01:05.289> one<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.830> I'm<00:01:06.430> gonna

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
I'm gonna take this one and I'm gonna

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.490 
I'm gonna take this one and I'm gonna
basically<00:01:06.940> put<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> over<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.780> silhouette<00:01:08.259> but

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
basically put it over the silhouette but

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.380 
basically put it over the silhouette but
the<00:01:08.590> problem<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.460> can<00:01:09.580> see<00:01:09.820> through

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
the problem is so you can see through

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.389

or you're gonna bang it even cheaper so
I'm<00:01:53.170> gonna<00:01:53.320> basically<00:01:53.500> make<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.070> white<00:01:54.250> part

look nice it'll kind of like outline it
it's<00:01:58.689> not<00:01:58.840> gonna<00:01:58.960> look<00:01:59.049> good<00:01:59.140> in<00:01:59.259> white<00:01:59.500> unless

lines nice clean edges basically once
get<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.810> on<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.170> bike<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:50.530> centered<00:03:50.890> I'm

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
get this on the bike and centered I'm

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.850 
get this on the bike and centered I'm
gonna<00:03:51.220> throw<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:52.120> carbon<00:03:52.480> fiber<00:03:52.750> piece<00:03:53.530> on

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
gonna throw the carbon fiber piece on

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.100 
gonna throw the carbon fiber piece on
and<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:54.790> gonna<00:03:54.910> look<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:55.840> not

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
and it's gonna look like that it's not

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.650 
and it's gonna look like that it's not
gonna<00:03:56.230> look<00:03:56.440> as<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.850> know<00:03:57.970> as<00:03:58.090> jagged<00:03:58.540> you

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
gonna look as you know as jagged you

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.789 
gonna look as you know as jagged you
know<00:03:58.780> I'm<00:03:58.900> not<00:03:58.989> gonna<00:03:59.170> have<00:03:59.290> all<00:03:59.380> these<00:03:59.500> little

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
know I'm not gonna have all these little

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.979 
know I'm not gonna have all these little
gaps<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.120> might<00:04:01.239> look<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.540> little<00:04:01.570> cleaner

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
gaps so it might look a little cleaner

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.050 
gaps so it might look a little cleaner
actually<00:04:02.860> I'm<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.400> hoping<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.850> don't<00:04:03.880> have

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
actually I'm just hoping I don't have

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.050 
actually I'm just hoping I don't have
any<00:04:04.269> sticking<00:04:05.459> issues<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.640> know<00:04:06.760> what<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:06.910> mean

any sticking issues you know what I mean
like<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.400> hope<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:10.170> tank<00:04:11.170> protector<00:04:11.530> tank<00:04:12.250> pad

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
like I hope the tank protector tank pad

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.199 
like I hope the tank protector tank pad
actually<00:04:13.000> sticks<00:04:13.360> well<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.730> vinyl<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:16.030> I'm

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
actually sticks well to the vinyl so I'm

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.360 
actually sticks well to the vinyl so I'm
gonna<00:04:16.359> have<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:16.780> test<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.709> if<00:04:18.190> it

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
gonna have to just test it out and if it

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.580 
gonna have to just test it out and if it
doesn't<00:04:18.549> then<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.479> peel<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:19.870> sucker<00:04:20.229> off<00:04:20.380> and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
doesn't then I peel this sucker off and

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.590 
doesn't then I peel this sucker off and
I<00:04:20.650> just<00:04:20.859> go<00:04:21.370> with<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.609> vinyl<00:04:21.850> until<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.300> figure

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
I just go with the vinyl until I figure

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.930 
I just go with the vinyl until I figure
something<00:04:22.630> else<00:04:23.140> on<00:04:23.320> either<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> point<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.729> I

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
something else on either the point is I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.500 
something else on either the point is I
need<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.180> find<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:26.490> tank<00:04:27.490> protector<00:04:27.910> that's<00:04:28.150> at

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
need to find a tank protector that's at

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.960 
need to find a tank protector that's at
least<00:04:28.570> bigger<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.320> size<00:04:30.010> than<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.669> sucker

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
least bigger in size than this sucker

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.750 
least bigger in size than this sucker
because<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.630> have<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.160> permanent<00:04:33.160> paint

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
because I have this permanent paint

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.990 
because I have this permanent paint
damage<00:04:34.180> underneath<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.770> I'm<00:04:36.640> sure<00:04:36.820> there's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
damage underneath it so I'm sure there's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.770 
damage underneath it so I'm sure there's
a<00:04:37.060> few<00:04:37.240> on<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.419> market

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
a few on the market

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.360 
a few on the market
I<00:04:37.900> know<00:04:38.110> Pro<00:04:38.320> Grip<00:04:38.470> doesn't<00:04:38.800> really<00:04:38.950> make<00:04:39.160> too

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
I know Pro Grip doesn't really make too

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.370 
I know Pro Grip doesn't really make too
many<00:04:39.460> others<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.030> don't<00:04:40.390> have<00:04:40.630> gaps<00:04:40.960> like

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
many others that don't have gaps like

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.860 
many others that don't have gaps like
this<00:04:41.560> one<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:42.790> is<00:04:42.970> actually<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.330> program

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
this one this is actually a program

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.270 
this one this is actually a program
design<00:04:44.200> as<00:04:44.349> well<00:04:44.530> but<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.770> think<00:04:44.979> this<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.250> a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
design as well but I think this is a

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.690 
design as well but I think this is a
knockoff<00:04:45.729> from<00:04:46.090> China<00:04:46.479> so

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
knockoff from China so

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.930 
knockoff from China so
I'm<00:04:48.300> gonna<00:04:49.100> slap<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.130> on<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> bike<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.730> see<00:04:50.820> what

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
I'm gonna slap it on a bike and see what

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.470 
I'm gonna slap it on a bike and see what
happens

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
happens

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.550 
happens
I<00:04:51.830> see<00:04:52.830> what<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:52.980> mean<00:04:53.250> by<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:55.050> haze<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.500> I

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
I see what I mean by the the haze that I

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.210 
I see what I mean by the the haze that I
got<00:04:55.740> here<00:04:55.980> it's<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.190> metallic<00:04:56.700> paint<00:04:58.130> get<00:04:59.130> it

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.570 
the focus
probably<00:05:01.440> won't<00:05:01.650> because<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.130> cell<00:05:02.340> phone

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580

straight tank line and now all I have to

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.040 
straight tank line and now all I have to
do<00:05:39.480> is<00:05:39.600> work<00:05:39.840> my<00:05:40.020> way<00:05:40.170> down<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:41.870> just<00:05:42.870> kind<00:05:43.020> of

work the air bubbles out just keep
pushing<00:05:45.210> outward<00:05:45.540> this<00:05:46.170> is<00:05:46.320> a<00:05:46.380> little<00:05:46.590> bit

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
pushing outward this is a little bit

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.350 
pushing outward this is a little bit
easier<00:05:46.980> than<00:05:47.130> doing<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.490> cell<00:05:47.730> phone<00:05:47.940> spring

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
easier than doing a cell phone spring

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.470 
easier than doing a cell phone spring
screen<00:05:48.960> protector<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:49.940> if<00:05:50.940> you<00:05:51.060> get<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.300> little

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
screen protector and if you get a little

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.010 
screen protector and if you get a little
bit<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.840> wrinkles<00:05:53.480> you<00:05:54.480> always<00:05:54.690> get<00:05:54.810> one<00:05:54.930> of

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
bit of wrinkles you always get one of

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.080 
bit of wrinkles you always get one of
those<00:05:55.140> if<00:05:56.010> you<00:05:56.100> take<00:05:56.280> credit<00:05:56.610> card<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:56.970> wrap

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
those if you take credit card and wrap

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.380 
those if you take credit card and wrap
it<00:05:57.270> with<00:05:57.360> something<00:05:57.980> soft<00:05:58.980> and<00:05:59.430> work<00:06:00.180> those

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
it with something soft and work those

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.790 
it with something soft and work those
out<00:06:02.000> but<00:06:03.000> if<00:06:03.540> I<00:06:03.690> haven't<00:06:03.870> run<00:06:04.110> if<00:06:04.290> I<00:06:04.410> run<00:06:04.590> into

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
out but if I haven't run if I run into

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.930 
out but if I haven't run if I run into
problems<00:06:05.160> I'm<00:06:05.250> gonna<00:06:05.400> have<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.640> just<00:06:05.760> get<00:06:05.910> a

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
problems I'm gonna have to just get a

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.870 
problems I'm gonna have to just get a
blow<00:06:06.150> dryer<00:06:06.420> and<00:06:06.630> heat<00:06:06.780> it<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.220> then<00:06:08.220> kind<00:06:08.790> of

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
blow dryer and heat it and then kind of

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.700 
blow dryer and heat it and then kind of
stretch<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.780> material<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:10.230> little<00:06:10.290> bit<00:06:10.560> around

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
stretch the material a little bit around

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.560 
stretch the material a little bit around
the<00:06:10.800> curves<00:06:12.800> okay<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:13.860> here<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.280> is<00:06:14.400> it<00:06:15.330> did<00:06:15.510> a

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
the curves okay so here it is it did a

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.230 
the curves okay so here it is it did a
pretty<00:06:15.750> decent<00:06:15.960> job<00:06:16.520> getting<00:06:17.520> it<00:06:17.670> on<00:06:17.820> without

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
pretty decent job getting it on without

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.760 
pretty decent job getting it on without
too<00:06:18.990> many<00:06:19.050> wrinkles<00:06:19.410> or<00:06:19.770> air<00:06:19.950> bubbles<00:06:21.770> and

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
too many wrinkles or air bubbles and

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.050 
too many wrinkles or air bubbles and
actually<00:06:23.190> that's<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.520> one<00:06:23.550> that<00:06:23.760> bothers<00:06:23.910> me

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
actually that's the one that bothers me

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.370 
actually that's the one that bothers me
the<00:06:24.240> most<00:06:24.300> I'm<00:06:24.630> gonna<00:06:24.720> probably<00:06:24.900> work<00:06:25.140> that

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
the most I'm gonna probably work that

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.320 
the most I'm gonna probably work that
well<00:06:25.500> no<00:06:25.620> but<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.250> bottom<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.730> couldn't<00:06:27.180> avoid

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.730 
well no but the bottom I couldn't avoid
the<00:06:27.390> bottom<00:06:27.870> causing<00:06:28.260> wrinkles<00:06:28.860> I<00:06:30.680> trying<00:06:31.680> to

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
the bottom causing wrinkles I trying to

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.510 
the bottom causing wrinkles I trying to
heat<00:06:31.920> it<00:06:32.070> up<00:06:32.160> with<00:06:32.310> my<00:06:32.490> breath<00:06:32.790> um<00:06:34.190> did<00:06:35.190> my<00:06:35.340> best

heat it up with my breath um did my best
no<00:06:36.060> one's<00:06:36.240> gonna<00:06:36.330> notice<00:06:36.570> that<00:06:36.860> especially

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
no one's gonna notice that especially

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.530 
no one's gonna notice that especially
when<00:06:38.040> you're<00:06:38.370> standing<00:06:38.670> from<00:06:38.940> this<00:06:39.090> distance

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
when you're standing from this distance

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.320 
when you're standing from this distance
I<00:06:39.780> mean<00:06:40.260> come<00:06:40.410> on<00:06:40.580> that<00:06:41.580> actually<00:06:41.940> looks<00:06:42.150> good

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
I mean come on that actually looks good

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.140 
I mean come on that actually looks good
the<00:06:42.510> way<00:06:42.540> it<00:06:42.660> is<00:06:43.520> but<00:06:44.520> I'm<00:06:44.730> gonna<00:06:44.940> probably

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
the way it is but I'm gonna probably

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.560 
the way it is but I'm gonna probably
stick<00:06:45.660> the<00:06:45.780> carbon-fiber<00:06:46.290> one<00:06:46.590> on<00:06:46.710> top<00:06:46.920> of<00:06:47.130> it

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
stick the carbon-fiber one on top of it

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.570 
stick the carbon-fiber one on top of it
if<00:06:48.570> it<00:06:48.660> doesn't<00:06:48.930> it<00:06:48.990> here<00:06:49.290> then<00:06:49.620> I'll<00:06:50.370> just

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
if it doesn't it here then I'll just

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.980 
if it doesn't it here then I'll just
take<00:06:50.760> it<00:06:50.790> off<00:06:51.000> and<00:06:51.240> just<00:06:51.510> stick<00:06:51.810> with<00:06:51.900> the

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
take it off and just stick with the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.840 
take it off and just stick with the
vinyl<00:06:52.320> it's<00:06:52.920> better<00:06:53.100> than<00:06:53.250> nothing<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:53.700> don't

against the tank some people buy the
grip<00:07:18.289> pads<00:07:18.529> so<00:07:18.800> that<00:07:18.889> they<00:07:18.979> have<00:07:19.129> extra<00:07:19.490> grip

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
grip pads so that they have extra grip

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.049 
grip pads so that they have extra grip
when<00:07:21.620> they're<00:07:21.800> cornering<00:07:22.669> and<00:07:22.789> things<00:07:22.939> like

when they're cornering and things like

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:24.549 
when they're cornering and things like
that<00:07:23.120> and<00:07:23.479> when<00:07:23.539> they're<00:07:23.749> coming<00:07:24.139> to<00:07:24.229> a<00:07:24.259> fast

that and when they're coming to a fast

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:25.959
