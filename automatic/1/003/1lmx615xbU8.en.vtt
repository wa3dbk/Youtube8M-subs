to dry up I get discoloration on my skin

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
to dry up I get discoloration on my skin
so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.880> put<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so I actually put this on and it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
so I actually put this on and it's
really<00:01:37.140> helped<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.710> sort<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> even<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.400> my

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
really helped to sort of even out my

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
really helped to sort of even out my
skin<00:01:38.549> tone<00:01:39.030> especially<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> summertime

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
skin tone especially in the summertime

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
skin tone especially in the summertime
but<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.100> great<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.490> acne<00:01:41.670> scars

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
but this is really great for acne scars

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
but this is really great for acne scars
I<00:01:42.540> highly<00:01:42.840> recommend<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.320> put<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I highly recommend it put this on a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
I highly recommend it put this on a
q-tip<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.340> dab<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.270> acne<00:01:45.420> scar

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
q-tip and just dab it on the acne scar

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.760 
q-tip and just dab it on the acne scar
so<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> put<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.710> over

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.740 
so you don't want to put this all over
your<00:01:46.920> face<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.210> acne<00:01:48.540> prone

your face because if you are acne prone

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539
