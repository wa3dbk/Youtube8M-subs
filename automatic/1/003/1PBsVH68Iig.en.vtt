but yeah seriously like I understand

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.710 
but yeah seriously like I understand
that<00:02:39.220> cheating<00:02:39.730> especially<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.360> take-home

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
that cheating especially on take-home

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.740 
that cheating especially on take-home
tests<00:02:41.110> will<00:02:41.379> happen<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> gen<00:02:43.569> ed

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
tests will happen but this is a gen ed

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.870 
tests will happen but this is a gen ed
man<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.799> got<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.129> little<00:02:45.340> bit<00:02:45.489> smarter

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
man you got to be a little bit smarter

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.120 
man you got to be a little bit smarter
about<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.180> change<00:02:46.450> them<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.530> perhaps

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
about it change them but I think perhaps

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.740 
about it change them but I think perhaps
that's<00:02:48.400> where<00:02:48.549> more<00:02:48.819> cheating<00:02:49.090> occurs<00:02:49.540> is

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
that's where more cheating occurs is

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.880 
that's where more cheating occurs is
because<00:02:49.780> when<00:02:50.110> you're<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.319> those<00:02:50.500> gen<00:02:50.739> ed

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
because when you're in those gen ed

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.140 
because when you're in those gen ed
courses<00:02:51.190> people<00:02:51.370> are<00:02:51.579> in<00:02:51.640> classes<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.030> they

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
courses people are in classes that they

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.580 
courses people are in classes that they
don't<00:02:52.329> really<00:02:52.450> care<00:02:52.720> about<00:02:52.870> you're<00:02:53.290> not

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
don't really care about you're not

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.680 
don't really care about you're not
really<00:02:53.920> pursuing<00:02:54.459> seriously<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.390> yeah

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
really pursuing seriously so yeah

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.420 
really pursuing seriously so yeah
exactly<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.410> do<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:56.769> it's<00:02:57.130> good<00:02:57.400> that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
exactly but I do think it's good that

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.309 
exactly but I do think it's good that
Harvard<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.690> after<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.110> because

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
Harvard is going after this because

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.430 
Harvard is going after this because
sometimes<00:02:59.890> what<00:03:00.069> we<00:03:00.190> see<00:03:00.400> especially<00:03:00.670> with

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
sometimes what we see especially with

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.330 
sometimes what we see especially with
universities<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.739> groups<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.099> general

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
universities and just groups in general

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.100 
universities and just groups in general
that<00:03:03.459> have<00:03:03.579> very<00:03:03.760> high<00:03:03.819> reputations<00:03:04.629> it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
that have very high reputations it's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.990 
that have very high reputations it's
when<00:03:05.260> something<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.280> has<00:03:06.549> it's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
when something like this that has it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.850 
when something like this that has it's
really<00:03:07.269> bad<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.540> them<00:03:07.930> they<00:03:08.140> happens<00:03:08.680> they

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
really bad for them they happens they

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.990 
really bad for them they happens they
just<00:03:09.040> kind<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.250> tried<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.549> sweep<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.819> under<00:03:09.970> the
