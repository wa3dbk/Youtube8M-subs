00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 and you are doing a quantity of 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.959
 activities inside the pool was 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.699
 learning to swim you're watching 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.520
 float up 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.900
 you are doing a lot of gymnastics 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.289
 today what we are going to do is 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.720
 work hard but always under the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.400
 water let's try to start nicolÃ¡s 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.630
 which is the most problem can get 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.039
 to have with breathing so 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.039
 we started with pop voice 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.620
 you had a 35-second apnea 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.880
 you hold 35 seconds I was dizzy already 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.250
 I could not anymore I could do a second more 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.720
 well and there was only one element left 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.070
 of the water is a record we are going to do all 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.150
 from that wall down water 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.150
 until you arrive and return 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.770
 practically they do the truth in 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:35.310
 police set 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.310
 they pulled up they arrested together and take off 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.159
 the goal was simple because we wanted 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.709
 improve their ability 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.899
 cardiorespiratory and good obviously 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.569
 you can not drive we need a 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.429
 Olympic pool for her alone so that 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.899
 she can do the exercise well 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.640
 nobody bothers her that nobody is in the 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.099
 water that no one talks to you that nobody 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 approach ok to see let's see how the 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.989
 time to return for how it will have gone 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 to lucia with the activity now I 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.500
 Contact 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 the grape 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120
 now 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 i 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.420
 well the tails so nobody gets upset 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.820
 to see right and family you can go 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.130
 can stumble and you can attack 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.630
 she 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.050
 Street 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.050
 yes 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.660
 the source of our hat guard and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.660
 OK 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.460
 after things turn 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.940
 but permanently in conflicts never 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.760
 We have done the same thing happens to 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.360
 those in groubles and friendly 3 to be 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360
 alone in life 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.900
 holy sky sergio so they are a 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.370
 group and we go to physical activities 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.349
 all together so that also so that 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.930
 help them to collaborate but 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.909
 obviously she does not want or does not want 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 being part of the group is bothered by 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.410
 group because they bother the smells of 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.260
 the gym good a little bit all 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.670
 and good the truth is that I leave you 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.410
 Handle yourself with the rest of your classmates 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.730
 on tour we can not depend made a 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.830
 exception to see if you could do the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.660
 exercise of your voice that no one is 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.580
 approach in the sink that everyone 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.519
 try against you and exercise what 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.239
 You can now make friends with you a little 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.180
 the environment 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.039
 corina 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.600
 it seems to me that we have to start 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.610
 do some kind of exercise for thing 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.289
 learn to respect first respect 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.600
 someone who took you a few years second 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.880
 respect your coach if you respect the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.229
 campus medical voice before it's that 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.580
 end up talking or anyone ends up 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.080
 talk and raise your hand to talk 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.389
 do not even hear what you are 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.949
 saying then being an attempt that 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.590
 started the program in not reacting 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.740
 So much good but you have to learn 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.370
 really to respect the person who 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.539
 we have ready let's go lucia to the balance 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.539
 like nobody understands me 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.400
 misunderstood 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.230
 and someone that someone could get in 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.200
 my shoes would ever understand me 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.410
 little when beloved territory 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.450
 and it guides us but it's hard to get in 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.050
 instead of in your place yes yes I will 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.050
 I understand
