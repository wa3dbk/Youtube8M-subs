00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
I have a job in which I have to make

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.619 
I have a job in which I have to make
some<00:00:04.380> precise<00:00:04.740> folding<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.730> some<00:00:06.299> printed

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
some precise folding of some printed

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.980 
some precise folding of some printed
material<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.319> half<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:08.179> this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.330> for<00:00:09.630> little

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
material in half and this is for little

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.890 
material in half and this is for little
accordion<00:00:10.260> book<00:00:10.679> but<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> things<00:00:12.719> I'm

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
accordion book but one of the things I'm

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.860 
accordion book but one of the things I'm
going<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.259> show<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.710> how<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> make<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
going to show you is how to make this

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
going to show you is how to make this
happen<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.080> little<00:00:16.470> faster<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.310> don't<00:00:17.490> have

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
happen a little faster so you don't have

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.210 
happen a little faster so you don't have
to<00:00:17.699> keep<00:00:17.820> matching<00:00:18.090> up<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.869> edges<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:20.130> you

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
to keep matching up the edges when you

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.390 
to keep matching up the edges when you
fold<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.150> paper<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.619> each<00:00:23.010> one

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
fold the the paper like this on each one

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
fold the the paper like this on each one
and<00:00:23.730> then<00:00:24.449> folding<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.439> half<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.619> I'm

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
and then folding it in half so what I'm

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.669 
and then folding it in half so what I'm
going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.640> take<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.910> triangle<00:00:30.679> like

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
going to do is I take a triangle like

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.260 
going to do is I take a triangle like
this<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> I'm<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> tape<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> down<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.149> my

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
this and I'm going to tape it down to my

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:49.360 
this and I'm going to tape it down to my
work<00:00:36.450> surface

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.670 

and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.180> another<00:00:51.270> triangle<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.200> I'm

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and then I have another triangle and I'm

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.900 
and then I have another triangle and I'm
going<00:00:52.830> to<00:00:52.890> sit<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.490> make<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> little

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
going to sit here and make a little

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.960 
going to sit here and make a little
corner<00:00:54.770> I'll<00:00:55.770> take<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.580> place<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
corner I'll take that in place and to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.280 
corner I'll take that in place and to
make<00:01:03.090> sure<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.390> doesn't<00:01:03.570> even<00:01:04.050> move<00:01:04.260> around

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
make sure it doesn't even move around

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.240 
make sure it doesn't even move around
too<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.220> press<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.480> that<00:01:06.620> now<00:01:07.620> all<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.980> have

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
too much press like that now all I have

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.930 
too much press like that now all I have
to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:09.290> fit<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.410> corner<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.920> push<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
to do is fit the corner in push this

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.600 
to do is fit the corner in push this
over<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> fold<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:19.620> have<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.400> very

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
over and fold and have this very very

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
over and fold and have this very very
quickly<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.690> I<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.260> to<00:01:22.380> worry<00:01:22.560> about

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
quickly and I don't have to worry about

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:33.160 
quickly and I don't have to worry about
matching<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.430> everything<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.300> perfect

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.660 

the<00:01:34.170> next<00:01:34.440> step<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.950> making<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.610> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the next step for making this a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.140 
the next step for making this a
accordion<00:01:36.450> insert<00:01:36.810> work<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:38.160> add<00:01:38.400> flaps<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
accordion insert work is to add flaps to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
accordion insert work is to add flaps to
it<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.009> attached

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it like this so that it can be attached

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.180 
it like this so that it can be attached
to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.150> board's<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.590> what<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> do

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
to the board's so what I'm going to do

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.050 
to the board's so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:47.580> set<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> jig<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.040> I'll<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.610> start<00:01:50.940> out

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
is set up a jig and I'll you start out

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.960 
is set up a jig and I'll you start out
with<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> piece<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.350> binders<00:01:52.680> board<00:01:52.980> I've<00:01:53.700> cut

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
with a a piece of binders board I've cut

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.390 
with a a piece of binders board I've cut
some<00:01:54.000> little<00:01:54.240> strips<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.830> glue<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
some little strips I'm going to glue the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.390 
some little strips I'm going to glue the
first<00:01:57.120> one<00:01:57.330> on<00:01:57.510> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.870> a<00:01:58.020> stop<00:02:01.130> which<00:02:02.130> will

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
first one on this is a stop which will

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.949 
first one on this is a stop which will
hold<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> fore<00:02:03.750> edge<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:05.659> insert<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:08.959> put

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
hold the fore edge of the insert and put

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.920 
hold the fore edge of the insert and put
this<00:02:10.200> down<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.739> here<00:02:11.600> then<00:02:12.600> I'll<00:02:12.720> take<00:02:12.900> my

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
this down on here then I'll take my

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.150 
this down on here then I'll take my
triangle<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.330> set<00:02:15.330> another<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.830> for<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> top

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
triangle and set another one for the top

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.250 
triangle and set another one for the top
I<00:02:20.989> need<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> little<00:02:22.200> longer<00:02:22.470> board<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:24.260> I've

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I need a little longer board here I've

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.190 
I need a little longer board here I've
made<00:02:25.530> some<00:02:25.980> longer<00:02:26.310> boards<00:02:26.670> now<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.209> I'll

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
made some longer boards now and I'll

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.199 
made some longer boards now and I'll
attach<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:30.170> head<00:02:31.170> stop<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:32.070> now<00:02:32.790> these<00:02:32.970> have

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
attach the head stop here now these have

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.570 
attach the head stop here now these have
to<00:02:33.390> be<00:02:33.420> longer<00:02:33.989> because<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.440> usually<00:02:34.830> attach<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
to be longer because I usually attach a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.780 
to be longer because I usually attach a
ruler<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:35.970> some<00:02:36.840> sort<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> straight<00:02:37.560> edge<00:02:37.790> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
ruler or some sort of straight edge to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.630 
ruler or some sort of straight edge to
this<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:41.190> suspended<00:02:42.080> above<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
this so that it's suspended above the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
this so that it's suspended above the
place<00:02:45.630> where<00:02:45.840> I'm<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.260> make<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.650> score

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
place where I'm going to make the score

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.350 
place where I'm going to make the score
so<00:02:48.660> then<00:02:48.840> I'll<00:02:48.959> set<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.470> piece<00:02:50.190> in

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
so then I'll set the piece in

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.830 
so then I'll set the piece in
and<00:02:52.780> then<00:02:53.680> do<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:58.650> another<00:02:59.650> one<00:02:59.890> here<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.840> this

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
and then do a another one here and this

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.330 
and then do a another one here and this
one<00:03:02.050> I'm<00:03:02.140> going<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.350> set<00:03:02.770> down<00:03:02.950> about<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
one I'm going to set down about a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.860 
one I'm going to set down about a
quarter<00:03:03.700> inch<00:03:03.730> longer<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.570> there's<00:03:04.780> a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
quarter inch longer so that there's a

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.450 
quarter inch longer so that there's a
freedom<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.380> movement<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:06.010> know<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:06.340> the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
freedom of movement you know in the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.750 
freedom of movement you know in the
space<00:03:06.790> here<00:03:10.590> now<00:03:11.590> before<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> do<00:03:12.130> anything<00:03:12.460> else

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
space here now before I do anything else

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.380 
space here now before I do anything else
I'm<00:03:13.750> going<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.080> take<00:03:14.290> some<00:03:14.530> packing<00:03:14.950> tape<00:03:16.470> and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
I'm going to take some packing tape and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.460 
I'm going to take some packing tape and
line<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.630> bottom<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:24.240> jig<00:03:25.240> here<00:03:25.600> this

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
line the bottom of the jig here this

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.950 
line the bottom of the jig here this
packing<00:03:27.130> tape<00:03:27.340> not<00:03:28.180> only<00:03:28.450> helps<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.810> keep

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
packing tape not only helps it keep

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.830 
packing tape not only helps it keep
clean<00:03:29.380> but<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.160> provides<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.820> smooth<00:03:31.330> surface

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
clean but it provides a smooth surface

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.150 
clean but it provides a smooth surface
for<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.080> paper<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.440> slide<00:03:32.860> against<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:38.680> you're

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
for the paper to slide against if you're

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.970 
for the paper to slide against if you're
doing<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.430> lot<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:39.700> these<00:03:39.790> things<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.980> paper

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
doing a lot of these things the paper

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.460 
doing a lot of these things the paper
tends<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.550> resist<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.240> surface<00:03:46.690> you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
tends to like resist the surface you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.380 
tends to like resist the surface you
know<00:03:47.620> here<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.820> doesn't<00:03:51.970> have<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.240> go<00:03:52.360> down

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
know here and it doesn't have to go down

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.420 
know here and it doesn't have to go down
the<00:03:52.690> ellipsoid<00:03:53.080> perfectly<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.890> has<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.220> sort

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
the ellipsoid perfectly just has to sort

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:05.940 
the ellipsoid perfectly just has to sort
of<00:03:54.520> cover<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.850> surface<00:04:01.470> okay<00:04:04.739> for<00:04:05.739> just

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
of cover the surface okay for just

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.080 
of cover the surface okay for just
another<00:04:06.190> little<00:04:06.519> piece<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:06.970> here<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.360> reform

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
another little piece in here to reform

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:19.650 
another little piece in here to reform
to<00:04:10.090> reinforce<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:11.019> surface<00:04:11.500> here<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:19.450> there

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
to reinforce this surface here so there

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.940 
to reinforce this surface here so there
we<00:04:19.810> have<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.950> all<00:04:21.100> shiny

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
we have a it's all shiny

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.880 
we have a it's all shiny
now<00:04:23.950> put<00:04:24.370> your<00:04:24.580> uh<00:04:24.930> make<00:04:25.930> your<00:04:26.140> your<00:04:26.440> master

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
like this and the usual way we do that

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.030 
like this and the usual way we do that
is<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.330> set<00:04:31.330> your<00:04:31.360> dividers<00:04:31.960> your<00:04:32.500> dividers<00:04:32.770> at

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
is to set your dividers your dividers at

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.570 
is to set your dividers your dividers at
each<00:04:33.130> end<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.580> then<00:04:34.150> use<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.510> ruler<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.580> score

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
each end and then use a ruler and score

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.240 
each end and then use a ruler and score
and<00:04:37.140> what<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.290> just<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.860> keep<00:04:39.100> from

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
and what is just like you to keep from

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
with the folded pieces in the jig here

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.080 
with the folded pieces in the jig here
so<00:04:44.650> I'm<00:04:44.740> going<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:45.010> take<00:04:45.220> just<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.580> simple<00:04:45.910> piece

I'm going to put my score knife in my
scoring<00:05:11.900> divide<00:05:12.710> folder<00:05:13.610> right<00:05:14.240> in<00:05:14.390> here<00:05:15.730> so

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
scoring divide folder right in here so

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.980 
scoring divide folder right in here so
that<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.970> know<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.420> score<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.780> going<00:05:17.930> to

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
that I know that the score is going to

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.470 
that I know that the score is going to
go<00:05:18.140> into<00:05:18.290> the<00:05:18.440> right<00:05:18.620> place

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
then I'll take tape and tape this to the

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:49.650 
then I'll take tape and tape this to the
upper<00:05:28.580> support<00:05:36.190> at<00:05:37.190> both<00:05:37.460> ends

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660

to actually stand these up and insert
them<00:06:58.900> inside<00:06:59.260> each<00:06:59.560> other<00:06:59.830> it<00:07:00.250> also<00:07:00.400> makes<00:07:00.760> it

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
them inside each other it also makes it

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.240 
them inside each other it also makes it
easier<00:07:01.240> for<00:07:01.450> when<00:07:01.810> you<00:07:01.930> have<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.170> pick<00:07:03.010> them<00:07:03.160> up
