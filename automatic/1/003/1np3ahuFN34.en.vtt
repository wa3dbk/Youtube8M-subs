00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 how dearly esteemed youth I am 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.830
 strawberry are seeing me a new delivery 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.830
 of almost creative 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.889
 they say that if two people are always 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.840
 according to everything one of them is not 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.460
 necessary we live in a world full of 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.590
 people so inevitably we're going to 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.090
 have disagreements disagreements that almost 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.740
 always scale to become 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.230
 heated discussions in which each 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.730
 one defends his point of view but if 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.320
 you think carefully, you're going to give 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.539
 mind that the discussions are pretty 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.099
 useless because even if you lose 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.560
 something much more important that is the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.900
 sympathy of the other whom you have made 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.940
 be bad with yourself and now wait 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.680
 his moment of revenge in the next 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.920
 is that is animated is the secret of 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.539
 how to always win a discussion I hope 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.430
 Enjoy it and also read your 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.140
 comments on twitter a strong hug 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.280
 dear youth and here we see each other 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 with more the next 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.970
 her and where are you going we go for the right 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.380
 down the wide road no no no no I think 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.600
 that we should go for the other 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.570
 but if the other way is the narrow one is 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.240
 difficult for that reason remember that in 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.430
 the bible says wide is the way that you 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.800
 leads to the doom that lives have made 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.170
 eight rooms this is the good way 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.660
 trust me you have lost here 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.990
 like 500 times already the walker spoke to 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.970
 the voice of experience look do what 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.920
 hell you want and go on your way 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.479
 difficult I'm going around here is where 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.479
 you think you're going with the food of the two 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.890
 her and where are you going we go for the right 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.560
 down the wide road no no no no I think 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.930
 that we should go for the other seriously and 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.940
 that's good even though this path is more 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.100
 difficult we're going to get there less time 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 that way it will take us several hours 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.460
 more and I also remembered what he says in 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.460
 the bible of the wide road 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.510
 maybe he's right I was going for the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.120
 wide road because it's more comfortable but 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.250
 no idea how long it takes to look at the truth 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.110
 I wanted to go for this one but you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.970
 you have more experience than me for these 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.160
 roads and sure you've been in 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.450
 many situations like this before like this 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.000
 that I think the smartest thing is 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.840
 trust in you 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.030
 Well I'm not so sure 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.460
 such if we eat a sandwich here 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.650
 while we reviewed the map and decided 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.650
 what is the best way to perfect
