way<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.600> guess<00:01:06.600> let's<00:01:06.810> check<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> other

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
way I guess let's check out the other

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.910 
way I guess let's check out the other
C's<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.340> oh<00:01:09.290> yeah<00:01:10.290> um<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:15.710> right<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
C's for now oh yeah um all right so

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.630 

naman<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.479> sanely<00:01:54.840> high

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
naman has some and it's sanely high

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.370 
naman has some and it's sanely high
stats<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:58.219> as<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.939> he<00:02:00.329> invaded<00:02:00.930> all

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380

but<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.719> even<00:02:03.719> though<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.170> hood<00:02:04.439> did

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
but one and even though one hood did

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.859 
but one and even though one hood did
nothing<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:07.039> this<00:02:08.479> experiment<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.750> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
nothing and this experiment so it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.980 
nothing and this experiment so it's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.160 

or<00:02:14.990> maybe<00:02:15.230> not<00:02:15.850> he'll<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> massive<00:02:17.750> amount

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
