00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
gonna use my rolling pin keep it moving

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.130 
gonna use my rolling pin keep it moving
if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.629> find<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.260> gonna<00:01:04.439> stick<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.040> you

press it right on to the fondant and use

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.969 
press it right on to the fondant and use
your<00:01:40.700> rolling<00:01:41.060> pin<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.960> get<00:01:42.079> it<00:01:42.259> into<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
your rolling pin to get it into the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.270 
your rolling pin to get it into the
cracks<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:43.850> crevices<00:01:44.409> or<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.709> can<00:01:45.920> place

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
cracks and crevices or you can place

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.419 
cracks and crevices or you can place
your<00:01:46.750> fondant<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.959> top<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.619> your<00:01:48.799> cake<00:01:49.069> board

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
your fondant on top of your cake board

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:57.639 
your fondant on top of your cake board
and<00:01:53.829> do<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> same<00:01:55.219> thing<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:55.929> all<00:01:56.929> depends<00:01:57.530> on

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
and do the same thing so all depends on

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.370 
and do the same thing so all depends on
what<00:01:58.220> you're<00:01:58.399> trying<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.789> achieve<00:01:59.140> the<00:02:00.140> best

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
what you're trying to achieve the best

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.429 
what you're trying to achieve the best

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
way I find is to actually place your

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.139 
way I find is to actually place your
fondant<00:02:03.979> on<00:02:04.220> your<00:02:04.700> board<00:02:05.119> because<00:02:06.729> if<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.970> do

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
fondant on your board because if you do

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
fondant on your board because if you do
it<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.390> other<00:02:08.420> way<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.349> once<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.399> have<00:02:10.610> your

over<00:03:05.090> your<00:03:06.010> 12-inch<00:03:07.930> project<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
over your 12-inch project this is just a

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.089 
over your 12-inch project this is just a
smaller<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.959> but<00:03:12.109> I<00:03:12.169> really<00:03:12.530> like<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.889> design

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
smaller one but I really like the design

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.970 
smaller one but I really like the design

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
that comes out with it and then you're

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.390 
that comes out with it and then you're
just<00:03:16.130> gonna<00:03:16.340> go<00:03:16.519> ahead<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.910> use<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> knife<00:03:17.510> and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400

now<00:03:36.269> at<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.659> point<00:03:36.959> my<00:03:38.150> board<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.510> ready<00:03:39.750> for

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
now at this point my board is ready for

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.820 
now at this point my board is ready for
