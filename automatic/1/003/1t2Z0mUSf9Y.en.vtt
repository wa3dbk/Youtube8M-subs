 Manchego cheese grated here are they 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.340
 practically seven super ingredients 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.770
 simple and for the preparation is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 still much simpler let's put 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.829
 that in the blender the cream and this one 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.230
 potato cake and pumpkin the truth 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.820
 it's like it's very typical but 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 we usually think about zeal nothing 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 more with potatoes and the combination of the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
 pumpkin field is great and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.719
 especially for children to disguise 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.579
 a little to eat vegetables 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.469
 different sequences that good gourd 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.739
 because it brings many vitamins in addition 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.210
 that it has a lot of water, few calories and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.070
 a lot of fiber so is that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.490
 is excellent and let me tell you that the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 Pope is the 4th the fourth food 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.040
 main worldwide after the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 rice and corn wheat 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.119
 let's put then in the blender 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 cream chipotle chicken soup 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.970
 in powder and we are going to liquefy this creampie 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.509
 nothing more fractioned in the very creampie 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 simple and we have practically 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.440
 list and while we are forming our 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.880
 potato cake and pumpkin I have to 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.950
 choose what you can be two 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.410
 forms the first time how are we going to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 see here in the program in two layers of 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.720
 a layer of potatoes and arranged layer of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.179
 pumpkin or if you cut your 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.119
 sliced pumpkin what can be is 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.679
 intersperse a slice of potato a slice 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.820
 of pumpkin a slice of potato one of 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.830
 Pumpkin so you can see both 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.960
 colors and light that also very much its 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.970
 cake in another way what are we going to 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 to do here is to accommodate our potatoes in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.030
 respect us needed square 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.069
 of which we usually have at home 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 we have here are slices of potato 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.130
 pretty thin so they soften 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.230
 much easier remember that the potato 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.959
 takes longer than the pumpkin then like 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.489
 we're going to bake them at the same time 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.069
 I suggest you please that the potato be 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.590
 pretty pretty thin so you do not know 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.660
 let us go free the potato and the pumpkin 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.470
 defenders and fees that you have 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.530
 that also think about that then the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.360
 well fine potato and zucchini 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.680
 Well, also thin but at 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.739
 better we can have a little more 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.580
 thick we're going to cover it here with a 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.350
 little bit of our boy mix is 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.060
 in our chipotle cream we are going to 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.940
 cover also with cheese of course 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.250
 with ham cited we are quoted that we have 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.500
 here cut into slices and the next 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.760
 base layer of pumpkin let's put a 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.269
 reverse 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.340
 so that it looks more to this list 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.980
 it is a delight the truth is a delight 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.189
 lady and we are taking advantage of truth 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.140
 the good one because many times you do not know 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.370
 how to prepare pumpkins you have to give 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.930
 this stuffed in that the ribbons 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.810
 conservative and that the reaction of all 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.880
 forms but this cake and combined with 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.070
 the pumpkin and the potato is fabulous 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.170
 is ready let's also cover a 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:31.770
 little with the cream is perfect let's 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.300
 put back some ham cited 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.480
 to this rich a little bit more then the ham 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.270
 then ham ham of normal or lose 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.730
 well it can also be the ham of 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.140
 turkey or turkey breast because you already know 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.770
 I 'm a super fan of turkey breast 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.030
 at home at home of course they have 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.790
 generally turkey breast and everything 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.160
 full of turkey trying that way of what 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.880
 we use a little less 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.550
 calories and make our vices something 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.350
 a little bit lighter especially in 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.330
 matter of fat because the ham of 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.760
 legs has a little more fat and 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.750
 of calories than turkey breast now 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.910
 there are people who like the breast of 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.980
 turkey, well, wonderful, the ham is 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.960
 rich and can be ham leg ham 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.670
 as I told them or turkey ham also 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.780
 that works very well and that has not 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.820
 tried problem because it is also 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.210
 quite rich enough well let's 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.230
 cover here with the remaining chips 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.150
 we can make the layers that you 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.630
 want depending also on the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.760
 amount of crema that have made a 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.200
 Once the creampie was enough 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.770
 To cover 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.130
 23 these three capitals we are going to put the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.200
 rest of the chipotle cream covering 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.090
 perfectly well our potatoes win 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.730
 more than delight the truth is that something 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.840
 so simple and with you try it 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.880
 they will see what delight is ready 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.880
 let's put a little ham 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.519
 let's cover it with the cheese for 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.889
 gratin and I'm going to take it to the oven 

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:06.219
 preheated to 180 degrees felt by 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.439
 course for about 25 30 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.199
 minutes to see that the potato on 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.689
 all the potato has softened lady 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.819
 because remember that pumpkin softens 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.589
 it's much easier to cook much more 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.269
 easy much more quickly than the potato 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.459
 if they already feel that the 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:22.779
 patita is already was requested 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.219
 at this moment it is ready and by 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.439
 course is the cheese has been gratinated 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.509
 I took this to the oven and you 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:30.279
 they are here in a commercial court of 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.929
 flown lady our takeoff because 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.249
 ok we are with the chops is 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:37.409
 extracting that it's also worth it 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.409
 see them like this is that it clears we think 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:42.550
 Step by step pumpkin pie and pap 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.379
 to gratin liquefy the cream with the chili 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.569
 Chipotle and chicken powder consommé 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.459
 reserve in a refractory as a 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.259
 layer of potatoes on top of a pumpkin 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.209
 a little ham and cover with a little 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.619
 the cream and the grated cheese repeat the 

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:56.139
 procedure until finishing with the 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:58.119
 ingredients bakes for 40 minutes or 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:02.129
 until the potatoes are cooked and the 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.129
 already gratin cheese offers 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.389
 you knew that in the world there are five thousand 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.060
 varieties of potatoes and in Peru 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.310
 they find about three thousand has been 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.409
 cultivated for eight thousand years in 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.930
 South America and the main food 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:23.300
 for the Incas who developed 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.300
 Advanced techniques for storing them
