00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.850
 how and when we be right small 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.189
 this little boy and is it worth 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.950
 generally bring them because not 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.270
 aware of turning on the fact that 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.700
 relationship with girls like 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.539
 correctly builds so as 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.850
 growing up and first become 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.850
 as well as walking 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.440
 that is, how to apply it like this 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.180
 Here is the concentration as you can 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 get goals so that they have near 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.830
 for example, only one woman lived 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.830
 good question 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.450
 maybe we can't perfect now 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.950
 so an organization for our children in this 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.930
 culture becomes harder 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.600
 and harder 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.150
 Well, although the local culture is not so 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.810
 difficult as we say in Europe and America 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.509
 there really is not difficult sometimes 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.320
 impossible in that environment but here there is 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.400
 some already 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.590
 still possibility ounces ie boys 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:31.060
 bring up like muttering reef this whole 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:35.080
 the art of pure men and about 8 9 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.840
 years awakens this background in a child 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.550
 naturally he will have new 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.600
 feeling of excitement and he gets scared 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.610
 just never experienced it before 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.380
 calm down to prepare sexy 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.960
 feelings can be experienced in a dream let's say 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.250
 or well or someone like him not 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.829
 important it could be a teacher at school 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.530
 even children feel that way but look 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.659
 at this age when just already 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.520
 this background is awakening, it has not yet matured 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.700
 you just start waking up right away 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.530
 teach morality what it is 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.180
 friendship teach their friendship begin already 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.549
 eight nine ten eleven years 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.220
 that period when they are very drinking in this 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.880
 group aiming true friendship to teacher 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.400
 true friendship then morally 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.010
 moral principles they very much appreciate in 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.020
 this age when you say no 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.760
 fear they fear but the feeling remains 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.370
 so in a long time you can not keep exactly the same 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.930
 but when you morale instill friendship 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.170
 loyalty such high ideals here 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.770
 story telling about it this 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.210
 this is what you need to sublimation platonic 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.650
 feelings remain memorized 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.350
 they so much pure love is good 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.730
 remove problems big 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.880
 here keep this pure love like 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.380
 You can need longer with the help of such 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.860
 moral principles of philosophical 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.860
 of principles 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.940

 give an example until what time is it 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.120
 the main thing to give in time to give it 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.800
 the child will understand this even if 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.090
 error committed some he corrected 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.550
 quickly he himself will fix the main 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.960
 in time to give these values 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.790
 why study mahabharata well then 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.790
 many such very moral 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.620
 examples of some kind of heroism 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.020
 love and loyalty 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.310

 hurt for russia and holds open 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.970
 felt in detail how they feel 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.680

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.330
 it is to admire it open the desired 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:08.459
 the moment they become clean when we give 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:10.810
 this to children is all important at night 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.459
