00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello youtube personal good today I go 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.290
 to teach you how to make the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.330
 some coconut or the first the first 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 The first thing I have to say is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.119
 that we take a piece of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.550
 coconut so that you have a child to filter 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.300
 water faster then 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.369
 and how can you see here? 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.750
 here is also without a piece of peel 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 of the body 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.910
 I do this because the bud leaves more 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.480
 quicker to get out and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.480
 here guys 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.420
 so soon it will come out the bud is okay 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.059
 easier to get out with than I have 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.550
 to talk about the same coconut he so 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 in this state 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.079
 if the bud leaves you can eat the nucleus 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 You you remember that I told 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.750
 you a superfood that the armies 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.250
 used to be to get around 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.360
 then the coconut is one of them because later it is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.470
 every palm tree all the whole 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.009
 The core of an edible palm neckel 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.070
 and bamboo 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 bamboo also gives to buy eat 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.500
 people can eat the core of it, which is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.790
 it is a species of palm and too right 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:39.570
 the coconut 's nothingness' core also gives 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.960
 to eat right until this is what it is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 palm is the coconut defend 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.320
 eating is also good here people here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.390
 I'll show you soon that I 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.909
 I put in the water it's just you change water 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.420
 every day that will leave the bud here 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.909
 You change water every day, not here. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.430
 to create dengue 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.640
 if you're not afraid to leave you water 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.539
 more than change every day, right? 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.039
 I think it works better then it was 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.300
 This is what I wanted to talk about, right? 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.460
 I am 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.740
 the coconut fits in those 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.680
 I told you about the superfoods I 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.830
 I think it's a great an excellent 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 means for survival to 'list 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.490
 Survival is a good list, that's all.
