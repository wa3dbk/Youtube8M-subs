middle then you fold it like this and
place<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.239> well<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:02.149> then<00:01:03.149> from

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
place it really well like that then from

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.870 
place it really well like that then from
there<00:01:03.809> we're<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.339> little

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there we're going to make this little

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.000 
there we're going to make this little
very<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.450> legal<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> folk<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.740> that

very what legal of the folk like that
and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:09.210> fold<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.189> hold<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and then fold it like this hold it and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
and then fold it like this hold it and
then<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.689> over<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> see

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
then this one over here like you see

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.570 
then this one over here like you see
right<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.420> fold<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.580> like

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
right here we fold it like that like

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
right here we fold it like that like
that<00:01:20.900> they<00:01:21.900> will<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.290> an<00:01:22.409> ear<00:01:22.650> /<00:01:23.210> /<00:01:24.210> h<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that they will put an ear / / h and the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
that they will put an ear / / h and the
edge<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.250> truth<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> edge<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.110> square

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
edge I truth to the edge of the square

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.370 
edge I truth to the edge of the square
lights<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:32.700> open<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
lights off and then from here we open it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.440 
lights off and then from here we open it
like<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.210> frustrate<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
like that you can frustrate like that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.230 
like that you can frustrate like that
then<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.600> fold<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.640 

so<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.780> record<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.560> I'm

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
so this one record that's what I'm

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.440 
so this one record that's what I'm
talking<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.940> guess<00:01:48.180> should

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
talking about this one I guess should

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.350 
talking about this one I guess should
pull<00:01:48.750> off<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.500> paper<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.730> one's<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.330> here

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pull off the paper this one's right here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.730 
pull off the paper this one's right here
is<00:01:51.870> like<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.470> i<00:01:53.070> need<00:01:53.370> about<00:01:54.170> about<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.410> eight

more from here so you can pass it all

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.730 
more from here so you can pass it all
the<00:01:59.460> way<00:01:59.640> down<00:01:59.670> from<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.140> put<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.590> all

the way down from here and put it all

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
the way down from here and put it all
the<00:02:02.010> way<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.910> it's<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.900> each

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the way up to here it's about in each

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
the way up to here it's about in each
more<00:02:06.980> but<00:02:07.980> if<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> glue<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> can

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
more but if you have a glue you can

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600 
more but if you have a glue you can
actually<00:02:09.660> get<00:02:09.780> proof<00:02:10.140> coo<00:02:10.649> coo<00:02:10.679> right<00:02:11.250> here

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
actually get proof coo coo right here

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.360 
actually get proof coo coo right here
and<00:02:12.300> fold<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:14.400> right<00:02:14.690> from<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.370> then

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and fold it that's right from there then

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690 
and fold it that's right from there then
you<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.570> put<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.490> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you go and you put this this one so you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.820 
you go and you put this this one so you
can<00:02:20.910> actually<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.650> for

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
can actually go like that this is for

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.820 
can actually go like that this is for
you<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.130> i<00:02:23.280> cook<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.709> put<00:02:25.709> it

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you if i cook if you go like this put it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.400 
you if i cook if you go like this put it
like<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:27.420> sure<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.690> all<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> way<00:02:28.020> in

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
and then you can put the glue over here

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.250 
and then you can put the glue over here
and<00:02:31.970> put<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.120> all<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:34.020> way<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:36.080> they're<00:02:37.080> going
