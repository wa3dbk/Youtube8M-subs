lots of for not accountable and we can

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:55.260 
lots of for not accountable and we can
also<00:01:41.530> use<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.490> lot<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:47.249> and<00:01:49.590> lotsa<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.909> not

animals<00:01:56.049> now<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.399> what<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:58.030> recommend<00:01:58.479> for

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
animals now this is what I recommend for

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.929 
animals now this is what I recommend for
example<00:01:59.770> when<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.789> talk<00:02:01.270> about<00:02:01.299> dreams<00:02:02.289> of

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
example when you talk about dreams of

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.700 
example when you talk about dreams of
send<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.990> healer<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.859> your<00:02:06.670> head<00:02:07.350> grains<00:02:08.350> of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
send the healer in your head grains of

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.930 
send the healer in your head grains of
sugar<00:02:09.450> things<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.020> use<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.400> neutral

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
sugar things like that use the neutral

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.540 
sugar things like that use the neutral
form<00:02:13.510> which<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.620> lot<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.400> lots<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:16.440> okay<00:02:17.550> so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
form which is a lot or lots of okay so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.400 
form which is a lot or lots of okay so
we<00:02:19.450> don't<00:02:19.990> know<00:02:20.260> whether<00:02:20.770> it's<00:02:20.920> much<00:02:21.460> or<00:02:21.850> mini

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
we don't know whether it's much or mini

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.590 
we don't know whether it's much or mini
go<00:02:23.410> ahead<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.860> use<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.310> lot<00:02:24.610> or<00:02:25.110> lots<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:27.330> okay

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
go ahead and use a lot or lots of okay

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.920 
go ahead and use a lot or lots of okay
so<00:02:29.280> again<00:02:30.280> much<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:32.260> non<00:02:32.530> countenance<00:02:33.930> when

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
so again much for non countenance when

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.340 
so again much for non countenance when
we<00:02:35.140> talk<00:02:35.380> about<00:02:35.410> large<00:02:36.100> quantities<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.350> middle

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
we talk about large quantities a middle

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.780 
we talk about large quantities a middle
when<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:38.770> talk<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.010> low<00:02:39.910> quantities<00:02:41.790> maybe

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
when we talk about low quantities maybe

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.110 
when we talk about low quantities maybe
for<00:02:43.510> counter<00:02:44.050> goals<00:02:44.320> when<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.770> talk<00:02:45.010> about

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
for counter goals when we talk about

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.830 
for counter goals when we talk about
large<00:02:46.120> quantities<00:02:47.020> of<00:02:47.730> fuel<00:02:48.730> when<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:49.600> talk

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
large quantities of fuel when we talk

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.150 
large quantities of fuel when we talk
about<00:02:50.010> lower<00:02:51.010> quantities<00:02:52.440> ok<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.770> then<00:02:53.950> from

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
about lower quantities ok so then from

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:12.260 
about lower quantities ok so then from
here<00:02:54.750> large<00:02:55.750> quantities<00:03:03.840> local<00:03:04.840> quantities

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.880 

here<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.610> large<00:03:15.610> quantities<00:03:17.580> and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
here this is for large quantities and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.400 
here this is for large quantities and
this<00:03:20.890> one<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.370> for<00:03:21.640> low<00:03:21.940> quantities<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.760> few

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
this one is for low quantities a few

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.710 
this one is for low quantities a few
okay<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:27.040> i<00:03:27.370> hope<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:30.520> clears<00:03:30.820> up<00:03:31.240> your

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
okay so i hope this clears up your

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.820 
okay so i hope this clears up your
claims<00:03:32.080> about<00:03:32.500> when<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.100> use<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.990> when

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
claims about when to use of you and when

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.400 
claims about when to use of you and when
to<00:03:36.070> use<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.670> little<00:03:38.310> okay<00:03:39.510> okay<00:03:40.510> thanks<00:03:41.290> for
