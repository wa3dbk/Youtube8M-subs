00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone and find on phobia and today 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.069
 we keep talking about the movie the avengers 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.769
 2 era of altron and I myself will already be touched 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.420
 talked in the last issue but today 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.099
 continue the conversation from others 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.590
 antagonists to be with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.590
 meet and challenge our heroes 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.939
 but we will begin with the baron vargan von 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.130
 striker 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.880
 well or striker as in a number of old 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 transfers the most interesting what exactly he 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.890
 they red skull is primordial 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.930
 the leader of the hydra although now more often 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.969
 red skull can be seen at the helm 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:50.969
 as the brightest villain cap like 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:55.739
 calculate the hydra member until the morning that is 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:59.340
 it is but repeat my time exactly the background 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 stalker along with the order of evil ninjas under 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 name hand created a hydra and you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.369
 noticed that Americans are generally very 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.640
 strange picture of ninja 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.560
 Well, there is a hand clans of the foot I need 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 own comic pro can not be drawn 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.290
 and call it put under the knee dimple 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.320
 by the way this is the name of the place under 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.570
 Knee the film precisely von striker 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.090
 will cause a new gathering of the avengers 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 obviously his role in the new film will be 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 something like the appearance of a rhino in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.900
 the entry of the new spiderman is also 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.390
 the appearance of this character 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.450
 will be an introduction to the history of twins 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 Peter i want and maxims also known 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.240
 like mercury and scarlet witch pietro evanda 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.700
 children of one of the most legendary 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.189
 magnet mutants and gypsy magda a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.380
 last name they got from their adoptive father 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.380
 named Jung Maksimov 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.650
 when over time the abilities of twins 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.110
 began to enter into full force local 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.080
 take a vanda for a witch and try 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.280
 burn yes here it is European remote 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.970
 eyes of americans 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 and you're still offended by the cranberries twins 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.680
 saves the magnet and those of gratitude 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.260
 join his fraternity of evil 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.209
 mutants go we have one of the most important 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.100
 aspects of these characters 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.110
 despite the fact that in the universe of comics heroes 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.840
 and the villains quite often change places 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.239
 for vanda and pietro this can be said 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.100
 permanent state most of 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.050
 time, they are rather positive 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.150
 characters but their connection to the magnet 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.459
 thanks for saving quite 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 strongly associate them with the father and therefore 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.940
 often on comic book pages and in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.780
 animated series they stand on the side 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.970
 magnet 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.610
 although more often they can be seen on the side 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.890
 avengers wanda even had some time 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.290
 wife navi same not yes yes that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.480
 created by the altron not this 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.200
 my opinion is rather unnatural 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.200
 union of robots 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.630
 as for the ability they have vanda and 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.030
 pietro completely different perhaps 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.489
 pietro is the closest analogue of the slash of 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.390
 universe di si i even have a logo on 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.750
 breasts it seems 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.680
 his main ability is 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.570
 superhuman speed well and 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.579
 strong enough body to this 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.070
 speed to survive he can run on 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.970
 water walls dodge bullets and all 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:34.130
 it is generally very, very fast 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 very fast runner hi 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 all the power of the scarlet witch is very 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.640
 varied but mostly revolves around 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.310
 manipulation of reality 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.830
 probabilities as well as in every possible way magical 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.410
 spheres well or witch spheres the bottom line is that 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.800
 in addition to the mutant upgrade scarlet witch 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.280
 uses house magic and what does 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.290
 magicians will ask me attentive viewer 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.400
 I have no idea 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.770
 Eldar Nosta them no scene Nightingale 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.840
 dude you will be cool 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:22.970
 no dude sucks pancake only one 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:24.460
 think you'll look cool time 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.350
 the horror of some 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.390
 Well, learn more about the history of characters 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.910
 you can from the comic book avengers 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.470
 origin vision and the scarlet witch 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.270
 the twins lit up in the original 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.520
 comics about the adventures of the X-Men for 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.720
 number 4 released in march 1964 in 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.570
 the scene after the captions of the movie captain 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.790
 america winter soldier 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.220
 the first avenger is another war we already 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.500
 managed to get acquainted with pietro ivangai and 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.650
 in this scene, baron von striker says 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.870
 what begins the era of miracles and here we are 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.540
 we enter the territory of pure theories and 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.910
 guesses first thing marvel studios not 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.010
 can use the term mutants then 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.410
 is there any character that has gen x 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.850
 is under the influence of the 20th century fox 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.650
 so the twins 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.320
 marvel cinematic universe 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.020
 will be someone else on the other hand 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.550
 despite the fact that the scarlet witch mutant in 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.919
 her biographies are often featured 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.110
 mystical elements mentioned magic 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.060
 demons and everything else but as we remember by 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.130
 the stories of the torus which of god have made 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.470
 just alien with overdeveloped 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.350
 technology existence of magic in the world 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.510
 avengers unlikely for a long time 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.940
 there was a fan theory about what 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.669
 vandoy pietro translate from mutants to 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.320
 nowhere this seemed quite logical 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.590
 actually not people from mutants 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.540
 different him 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.430
 login except that the mutants 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.680
 It evolved in a natural way 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.690
 the revolution is not people from homo sapiens was 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.530
 artificially accelerated alien 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.300
 race cry 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.380
 and if you think most of the mutants and 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.570
 the rest of superheroes 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.340
 superpowers also differ not 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.160
 very much the same in favor of this theory 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.960
 spoke and long-standing close relationship and mercury 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.060
 with one of non-people crystal and a 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.790
 mekmillen also known as crystal 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.190
 crystal damn forever zapara with these 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.740
 accented however the producer kevin figs 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.480
 stated that at least not people and possess 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.510
 potential for appearing on a large 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.070
 screen but mercury and scarlet witch will not 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.040
 representatives of this race 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.050
 so what did the words of pc rudera mean 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.530
 that this is no longer a world of heroes and no world 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.240
 spies maybe only possible marvel 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.730
 decided to bring into the universe a new 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.980
 mystical element yes sure it is 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.950
 unlikely but think 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.330
 the next four years we are promised a movie 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.950
 about doctor strange 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.230
 and doctor strange magician he is not superman 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.600
 not an alien they are something like he 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.350
 a wizard who fights demons and 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.660
 all that 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.940
 besides the words pc shuber directly 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.340
 hinting about the emergence of a new force in 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.140
 marvel universe but given also that in 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.570
 the final scene was attended by the scepter 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.700
 Loki which is another fan of 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.580
 theories concluded another one of the stones 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.340
 infinity maybe wanda and pietro 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.560
 upgraded with the help of his power 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.780
 same marvel universe has repeatedly us 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.380
 showed that the functional stones 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.600
 infinity depends on only one 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.270
 writers desire Well output 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.700
 the film the avengers 2 era of altron is scheduled 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.890

 and look at Pietro Maksimov 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:29.250
