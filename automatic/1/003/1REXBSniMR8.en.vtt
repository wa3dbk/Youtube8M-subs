now there before options are you've got

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
now there before options are you've got
to<00:00:24.230> which<00:00:24.800> are<00:00:25.009> 72<00:00:25.310> 200<00:00:25.789> x<00:00:25.999> 2.8<00:00:26.779> one<00:00:27.679> of<00:00:27.800> them

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
to which are 72 200 x 2.8 one of them

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.249 
to which are 72 200 x 2.8 one of them
has<00:00:28.310> an<00:00:28.609> outlet<00:00:29.449> no<00:00:29.599> no<00:00:29.749> they<00:00:29.899> both<00:00:30.050> have

has an outlet no no they both have

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.749 
has an outlet no no they both have
ultrasonic<00:00:30.829> motors<00:00:31.130> but<00:00:31.339> one<00:00:31.489> of<00:00:31.609> them<00:00:31.699> has

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
ultrasonic motors but one of them has

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.120 
ultrasonic motors but one of them has
got<00:00:31.880> vibration<00:00:32.599> reduction<00:00:32.689> or<00:00:33.130> image

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
got vibration reduction or image

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.340 
got vibration reduction or image
stabilization<00:00:34.760> as<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.510> cotton<00:00:35.780> canon<00:00:36.109> terms

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
stabilization as the cotton canon terms

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.939 
stabilization as the cotton canon terms
and<00:00:36.590> then<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.579> got<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.410> 72<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.559> hundreds<00:00:39.920> of

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
and then it's got to 72 to hundreds of

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.549 
and then it's got to 72 to hundreds of
which<00:00:40.070> are<00:00:40.250> an<00:00:40.370> f4<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.840> remember<00:00:41.989> that<00:00:42.230> one

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
cheapest one which is the 70-200 f4 USM

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.119 
cheapest one which is the 70-200 f4 USM
that's<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.960> ultrasonic<00:01:03.530> motion<00:01:03.710> remain<00:01:04.010> it's

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
that's it ultrasonic motion remain it's

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.980 
that's it ultrasonic motion remain it's
nice<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.430> facts<00:01:04.730> app<00:01:05.089> focusing<00:01:05.600> but

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
nice and facts app focusing but

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.050 
nice and facts app focusing but
similarly<00:01:06.260> there<00:01:06.409> are<00:01:06.440> four<00:01:07.040> different<00:01:07.580> types

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
similarly there are four different types

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.130 
similarly there are four different types
of<00:01:08.530> these<00:01:09.530> lenders<00:01:09.860> as<00:01:10.760> shown<00:01:11.450> by<00:01:11.600> my<00:01:11.720> canon

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140

japanese magazine which we've got here
now<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.780> question<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.290> what<00:01:15.980> is<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.580> point<00:01:16.790> on

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
now the question is what is the point on

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.620 
now the question is what is the point on
what<00:01:17.590> which<00:01:18.590> lanes<00:01:18.890> would<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.220> buy<00:01:19.630> now

obviously the cheapest lens is the f4
and<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.410> one<00:01:24.560> without<00:01:24.890> any<00:01:25.220> image

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
and the one without any image

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.580 
and the one without any image
stabilization<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.720> cool<00:01:26.990> thing<00:01:27.200> about<00:01:27.260> all

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
stabilization the cool thing about all

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.410 
stabilization the cool thing about all
these<00:01:27.860> lenses<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> they're<00:01:28.700> very<00:01:28.730> well

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
these lenses is that they're very well

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.900 
these lenses is that they're very well
water<00:01:30.140> no<00:01:30.590> not<00:01:30.830> water<00:01:31.010> resistant<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.610> weather

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
water no not water resistant of weather

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.060 
water no not water resistant of weather
resistant<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.230> it's<00:01:33.350> raining<00:01:33.560> on<00:01:33.800> top<00:01:33.980> of

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
resistant so if it's raining on top of

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.880 
resistant so if it's raining on top of
your<00:01:34.190> camera<00:01:34.490> or<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.820> lens<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:36.590> probably

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
your camera or this lens you probably

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.230 
your camera or this lens you probably
will<00:01:37.190> be<00:01:37.340> fine<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.730> don't<00:01:37.970> think<00:01:38.090> you'll<00:01:38.210> have

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
will be fine I don't think you'll have

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.120 
will be fine I don't think you'll have
any<00:01:38.360> problems<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.320> rain<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.620> doesn't<00:01:39.890> rain

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
any problems in the rain it doesn't rain

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.430 
any problems in the rain it doesn't rain
will<00:01:40.340> get<00:01:40.580> inside<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.450> actual<00:01:41.630> lens<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
will get inside the actual lens and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.830 
will get inside the actual lens and
start<00:01:42.650> growing<00:01:43.280> fungus<00:01:43.550> inside<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
start growing fungus inside so the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.010 
start growing fungus inside so the
question<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.260> f4<00:01:46.250> or<00:01:46.430> f<00:01:46.640> 2.8<00:01:47.020> image

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
question is f4 or f 2.8 image

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.560 
question is f4 or f 2.8 image
stabilization<00:01:48.350> or<00:01:48.800> not<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:50.210> all<00:01:50.300> depends

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
stabilization or not and it all depends

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.670 
stabilization or not and it all depends
on<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.690> type<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:50.960> photography<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.560> you're

doing hockey if you're doing any of
these<00:02:04.790> things<00:02:05.090> then<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.610> image

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
these things then the image

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.359 
these things then the image
stabilization<00:02:08.769> isn't<00:02:09.769> really<00:02:10.069> good<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.280> be

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
stabilization isn't really good to be

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.650 
stabilization isn't really good to be
beneficial<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.000> because<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> shutter

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
beneficial to you because the shutter

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.040 
beneficial to you because the shutter

slower than the length of the lens so if

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
slower than the length of the lens so if
you've<00:02:26.400> got<00:02:26.430> 200<00:02:27.060> millimeter<00:02:27.420> lens<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.590> want

action sports with lots of light then

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.790 
action sports with lots of light then
you<00:02:45.450> don't<00:02:45.720> need<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.260> image<00:02:46.500> stabilization

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
you don't need the image stabilization

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.530 
you don't need the image stabilization
one<00:02:47.250> if<00:02:47.490> you're<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.000> mountain<00:02:48.390> where

one if you're out on the mountain where
it's<00:02:48.660> got<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:48.990> loads<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.530> snow<00:02:49.740> loads<00:02:50.130> of

sunshine f4 absolutely fine if you are
shooting<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.870> slightly<00:02:55.110> maybe<00:02:55.350> more

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
shooting in a slightly maybe more

shooting in a slightly maybe more
indoors<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.520> you're<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.570> lighting<00:02:58.020> isn't<00:02:58.230> so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
indoors and you're the lighting isn't so

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.580 
indoors and you're the lighting isn't so
great<00:02:59.600> then<00:03:00.600> that's<00:03:00.810> where<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.110> kind<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.380> want

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
great then that's where you kind of want

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.550 
great then that's where you kind of want
the<00:03:01.740> f<00:03:01.890> 2.8<00:03:02.240> so<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.330> f<00:03:03.420> 2.8<00:03:03.630> will<00:03:04.170> help<00:03:04.380> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the f 2.8 so the f 2.8 will help you

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.320 
the f 2.8 so the f 2.8 will help you
keep<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> hundredth<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.000> second

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
keep it at a hundredth of a second

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.690 
keep it at a hundredth of a second
shutter<00:03:06.510> speed<00:03:06.600> instead<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.140> 50th<00:03:07.470> or<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:08.550> put

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
shutter speed instead of 50th or to put

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.460 
shutter speed instead of 50th or to put
it<00:03:08.730> another<00:03:08.850> way<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.240> can<00:03:09.450> have<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.750> at<00:03:09.900> iso

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
it another way you can have it at iso

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.340 
it another way you can have it at iso
1600<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.460> set<00:03:12.030> off<00:03:12.210> with<00:03:12.450> f<00:03:12.690> for<00:03:12.960> you<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.230> have

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
1600 and set off with f for you to have

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.020 
1600 and set off with f for you to have
it<00:03:13.380> at<00:03:14.840> 3200<00:03:15.840> iso<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.489> where<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.820> image

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
it at 3200 iso so that's where the image

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.330 
it at 3200 iso so that's where the image
quality<00:03:18.239> will<00:03:18.630> also<00:03:18.959> benefit<00:03:19.350> by<00:03:19.530> having<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
most expensive lens but it's the one

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.510 
most expensive lens but it's the one
which<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:36.030> use<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.420> every<00:03:37.140> situation

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
which you could use in every situation

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.949 
which you could use in every situation
if<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.209> need<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.570> every<00:03:39.750> situation

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
if you don't need it in every situation

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.420 
if you don't need it in every situation
if<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:41.010> where<00:03:41.160> you're<00:03:41.250> definitely

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
if you know where you're definitely

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.890 
if you know where you're definitely
going<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.730> be<00:03:41.820> having<00:03:41.910> fast<00:03:42.390> shutter<00:03:42.600> speeds

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
going to be having fast shutter speeds

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.729 
going to be having fast shutter speeds
and<00:03:43.020> all<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.230> then<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.500> doesn't<00:03:43.650> really

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
and all that then it doesn't really

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.220 
and all that then it doesn't really
matter<00:03:43.980> if<00:03:44.610> you're<00:03:44.850> doing<00:03:45.060> weddings<00:03:45.480> where

matter if you're doing weddings where
you<00:03:46.530> most<00:03:47.100> likely<00:03:47.310> will<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.610> taking<00:03:48.000> photos<00:03:48.360> at
