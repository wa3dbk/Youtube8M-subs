00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.190
 the truth everything changed us in the first 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.830
 curve we have a great possibility of a 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.720
 great result both personally 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.800
 like the whole team was not a 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.990
 possibility of having fought for a 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.730
 victory and a podium also and good nothing 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.310
 one of the hands going with his team 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.550
 but from today we pay for mistakes of others 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.460
 Czech pilots the smoke that came out of the car 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 the field and it hurt you a bit or because 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.190
 the starts or the middle pastor like that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.680
 he went ahead I do not know no 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.890
 pastor stepped forward yes he went ahead 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.079
 but 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.070
 well, it went ahead pretty 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.260
 and they are super jones art 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.989
 I think it's an affection I've heard 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.250
 comments that say pastor provoked 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.320
 that the grill 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.270
 but I think that pastor has nothing 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.260
 what to do with the pastor made his mistake and 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.260
 then turn off after 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.140
 the big mistake was that bryant that 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.020
 grosjean 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.450
 I think it hit hamilton and well 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.430
 it's a disaster in the first corner 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.860
 grace of or nothing happens could have been 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.400
 quite serious but good no no no happens 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.800
 to older 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.150
 surely you have seen the incident and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.760
 it's completely bryant apology 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.760
 I think I think that sr 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.310
 I wanted to put hamilton in a position 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.710
 where there was no place for me I think that 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.720
 he could not move anymore but anyway that's 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.189
 my opinion at the end the stewards think 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.780
 that they must make a decision I think 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.899
 someone should be penalized someone should 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.220
 pay for that career because you do not know 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.759
 will spoil the career of many 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.289
 pilots and I think they should have 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.360
 consequences because he has already done 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.250
 similar careers that today in Monaco and 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.460
 others but good that is true someone 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.810
 should be prioritized because it is logical 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.659
 do not 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.740
 whoever the steelers think that 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.740
 It was my fault, I think it's not 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.979
 unfortunately good ended everything 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.110
 also when you hit her there pastor 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.000
 just as you had been stuck back would 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.640
 my car was totally destroyed 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.950
 then I think I touched a pastor or I do not know 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.610
 but I feel if it was a disaster and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.080
 after good I already once I 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.610
 had stuck I did not have the spoiler anymore 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.810
 the entire rear axle is the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.850
 back suspension was all 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.760
 totally shattered we go to a 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.230
 circuit that you also like italy 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.940
 can go well there the sauber and what 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.280
 Well, there are only a few days until 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.220
 revenge to get that bitter taste and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.220
 then good only seven days and it's going to 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.190
 think of monza to get us out of this 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.020
 weekend that promised much 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.020
 but good to think about what's coming
