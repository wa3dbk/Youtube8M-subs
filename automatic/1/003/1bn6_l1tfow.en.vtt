of<00:02:04.500> each<00:02:04.799> other<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:06.020> little<00:02:07.020> teepee<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of each other in a little teepee in this

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.330 
of each other in a little teepee in this
case<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> build<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.569> combined<00:02:10.340> fire

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
case I'm going to build a combined fire

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640 
case I'm going to build a combined fire
it's<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> combined

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's going to be a combined

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.479 
it's going to be a combined
TP<00:02:14.340> fire<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:16.439> beginnings<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.280> log

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
TP fire and the beginnings of a log

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.039 
TP fire and the beginnings of a log
cabin<00:02:17.519> I'm<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.239> going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.569> too<00:02:18.780> fancy

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
cabin I'm not going to get too fancy

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.740 
cabin I'm not going to get too fancy
with<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.560> log<00:02:19.739> cabin<00:02:20.069> log<00:02:20.939> cabin<00:02:21.450> would<00:02:21.599> be

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
with the log cabin log cabin would be

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.089 
with the log cabin log cabin would be
basically<00:02:23.209> like<00:02:24.209> your<00:02:24.480> Lincoln<00:02:25.260> Log<00:02:25.290> sets

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
basically like your Lincoln Log sets

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.009 
basically like your Lincoln Log sets
where<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.420> build<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:28.730> frame<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.060> larger

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
where you just build a frame of larger

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.789 
where you just build a frame of larger
wood<00:02:31.349> around<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.909> pile<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> tinder<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.409> this

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
wood around this pile of tinder and this

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.490 
wood around this pile of tinder and this
teepee<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.459> I'm<00:02:35.609> beginning<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.450> create<00:02:36.810> with

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
teepee that I'm beginning to create with

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.819 
teepee that I'm beginning to create with
kindling<00:02:38.099> now<00:02:38.720> if<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> notice<00:02:40.230> all<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.680> my

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
kindling now if you notice all of my

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.970 
kindling now if you notice all of my
wood<00:02:41.099> snaps<00:02:41.609> easily<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:43.500> nothing

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
wood snaps easily there's nothing

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.580 
wood snaps easily there's nothing
nothing<00:02:44.459> green<00:02:45.000> here<00:02:45.540> that's<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.319> sign<00:02:46.560> that

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
nothing green here that's the sign that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.780 
nothing green here that's the sign that
it's<00:02:46.950> dry<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.790> ready<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.659> burn<00:02:48.959> okay<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.609> it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
it's dry and ready to burn okay if it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.569 
it's dry and ready to burn okay if it
didn't<00:02:51.090> snap<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:52.069> probably<00:02:53.069> not<00:02:53.220> quite

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
didn't snap it's probably not quite

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.119 
didn't snap it's probably not quite
dried<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.319> hasn't<00:02:55.709> been<00:02:55.829> off

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
dried out and that it hasn't been off

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.089 
dried out and that it hasn't been off
the<00:02:56.670> tree<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.239> very<00:02:57.450> long<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:58.650> going<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
the tree for very long it's not going to

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.640 
the tree for very long it's not going to
burn<00:02:59.310> well<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.349> how<00:03:01.500> I'm

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
burn well so now you can see how I'm

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.920 
burn well so now you can see how I'm
laying<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.220> loosely<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:03.329> next<00:03:03.659> thing<00:03:03.810> I'm

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
laying that loosely the next thing I'm

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.270 
laying that loosely the next thing I'm
going<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.109> do<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.379> I'm<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> take<00:03:05.930> fuel

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
going to do is I'm going to take fuel

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.140 
going to do is I'm going to take fuel
which<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.930> two<00:03:09.930> fingers<00:03:10.500> or<00:03:10.739> bigger<00:03:11.159> and<00:03:11.459> I'm

which is two fingers or bigger and I'm

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.069 
which is two fingers or bigger and I'm
going<00:03:12.389> to<00:03:12.540> create<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.230> Lincoln<00:03:13.889> Log<00:03:14.159> setup

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
going to create that Lincoln Log setup

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.550 
going to create that Lincoln Log setup
that<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.139> told<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.709> about<00:03:16.799> just<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.609> bit<00:03:17.819> ago<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
as I build I'm going to be building

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:34.300 
as I build I'm going to be building
slightly<00:03:25.410> inward<00:03:29.299> okay<00:03:30.949> you<00:03:31.949> get<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.400> idea

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
slightly inward okay you get the idea

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.159 
slightly inward okay you get the idea
this<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.370> going<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.909> create<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> good<00:03:36.690> bed<00:03:36.989> of

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
this is going to create a good bed of

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.039 
this is going to create a good bed of
coals<00:03:37.730> for<00:03:38.730> me<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:39.000> cook<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.419> now<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:39.659> reach<00:03:40.019> down

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
coals for me to cook on now I reach down

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.569 
coals for me to cook on now I reach down
underneath<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.579> birch<00:03:44.579> bark

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
underneath and I like that birch bark

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.860 
underneath and I like that birch bark
now<00:03:47.579> there's<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.849> lot<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.209> things<00:03:48.419> that<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.690> can

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
now there's a lot of things that you can

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.640 
now there's a lot of things that you can
use<00:03:49.079> other<00:03:49.409> than<00:03:49.530> birch<00:03:49.859> bark<00:03:50.810> if<00:03:51.810> your<00:03:52.229> car

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
use other than birch bark if your car

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.390 
use other than birch bark if your car
camping

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
camping

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.009 
camping
you<00:03:54.239> could<00:03:54.599> have<00:03:55.729> soaked<00:03:56.729> some<00:03:57.060> newspaper<00:03:57.629> in

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
you could have soaked some newspaper in

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.710 
you could have soaked some newspaper in
wax<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:59.250> works<00:03:59.519> very<00:03:59.790> well<00:04:00.060> or<00:04:00.329> cardboard

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
wax that works very well or cardboard

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.199 
wax that works very well or cardboard
and<00:04:01.199> wax<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.799> would<00:04:02.340> work<00:04:02.489> real<00:04:02.760> well<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.180> a

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
and wax that would work real well as a

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.289 
and wax that would work real well as a
fire<00:04:03.510> starter<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.699> see<00:04:05.879> there's<00:04:06.120> no

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
fire starter so you can see there's no

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.920 
fire starter so you can see there's no
great<00:04:06.599> science<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:07.319> this<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:08.220> easy<00:04:08.870> once<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
great science to this it's easy once you

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.540 
great science to this it's easy once you
build<00:04:10.260> your<00:04:10.530> fire<00:04:10.799> you're<00:04:11.340> set<00:04:11.669> for<00:04:11.940> hours
