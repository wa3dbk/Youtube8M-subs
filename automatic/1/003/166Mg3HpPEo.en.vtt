00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
difficult one to get around but I just

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
difficult one to get around but I just
see<00:00:40.290> I've<00:00:40.530> made<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> successfully<00:00:41.370> moving<00:00:41.969> on

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
see I've made it successfully moving on

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810 
see I've made it successfully moving on
through<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.160> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> clearly<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.670> get

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
through the this is clearly we get

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.310 
through the this is clearly we get
drugged<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.329> everything<00:00:45.870> beyond<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
drugged because everything beyond this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.459 
drugged because everything beyond this
point<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.160> gets<00:00:47.370> insane<00:00:48.030> yeah<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
point just gets insane yeah it's kind of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.020 
point just gets insane yeah it's kind of
like<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> bad<00:00:49.890> dreams<00:00:50.129> map<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> cover<00:00:50.820> on

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
like the bad dreams map that I cover on

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
like the bad dreams map that I cover on
the<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.690> Trials<00:00:52.110> Evolution<00:00:52.140> Tuesdays<00:00:52.739> last

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the on Trials Evolution Tuesdays last

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
the on Trials Evolution Tuesdays last
week<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.430> believe<00:00:53.489> where<00:00:54.239> everything<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
week I believe where everything just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
week I believe where everything just
disappearing<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.620> coming<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:55.980> from

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
disappearing and coming out from

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.560 
disappearing and coming out from
underneath<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.640> things<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.239> being<00:00:57.360> built

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
underneath you things are being built

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
underneath you things are being built
it's<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.590> insane<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.460> physics

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's just insane and all these physics

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.130 
it's just insane and all these physics
but<00:01:00.000> playing<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:00.870> without

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
but playing into the game without

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
but playing into the game without
slowing<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.579> phenomenal

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
slowing it down is it's a phenomenal

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
slowing it down is it's a phenomenal
uh-huh<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.589> obviously<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.070> redlynx

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
uh-huh but obviously it's redlynx

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.620 
uh-huh but obviously it's redlynx
creating<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.450> their

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
creating it they kind of know how their

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.730 
creating it they kind of know how their
editor<00:01:06.900> works<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.260> pretty<00:01:07.439> sure<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:07.650> don't

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
editor works a pretty sure they don't

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
editor works a pretty sure they don't
have<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> problem<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:09.570> through

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
have this kind of problem going through

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
go I wanted to see if the helicopter

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
go I wanted to see if the helicopter
actually<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.140> anything<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.830> looks

actually do anything or is it for looks
turns<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.240> does<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.689> something<00:01:22.880> probably

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
turns out it does do something probably

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.609 
turns out it does do something probably

we go this is this is a cleaner run I

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.550 
we go this is this is a cleaner run I
want<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.630> actually<00:02:40.750> go<00:02:40.930> through<00:02:41.140> see<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.470> I

you rocks prick watch being built just
now<00:03:08.680> I'm<00:03:08.830> always<00:03:08.980> letting<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> building

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
now I'm always letting in a building

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.460 
now I'm always letting in a building
right<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.900> then<00:03:11.020> all<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.230> sudden<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
right and then all of a sudden the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.410 
right and then all of a sudden the
building<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.830> gonna<00:03:11.920> disappear<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.670> still<00:03:13.300> make

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
building is gonna disappear I still make

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.390 
building is gonna disappear I still make
a<00:03:13.450> pretty<00:03:13.630> decent<00:03:13.810> time<00:03:14.200> every<00:03:15.070> time<00:03:15.190> that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
a pretty decent time every time that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.680 
a pretty decent time every time that
floor<00:03:15.550> disappears<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.270> trip<00:03:16.510> it's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
floor disappears it's a trip it's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.539 
floor disappears it's a trip it's
difficult<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.170> kind<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.530> maintain<00:03:17.860> control

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
difficult to kind of maintain control

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.180 
difficult to kind of maintain control
because<00:03:19.140> instinct<00:03:20.140> tells<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.500> I'm<00:03:20.860> gonna

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
because instinct tells you I'm gonna

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.770 
because instinct tells you I'm gonna
land<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.519> something<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.090> then<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.269> disappears

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
land on something and then it disappears

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.910 
land on something and then it disappears
and<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.170> he<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:23.290> kind<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.560> throws<00:03:23.769> off<00:03:23.890> your

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
and so he just kind of throws off your

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.240 
and so he just kind of throws off your
game<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.640> small<00:03:25.120> mistake<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.570> there

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
game a small mistake right there

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.080 
game a small mistake right there
probably<00:03:27.250> lost<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.489> little<00:03:27.580> bit<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.790> time<00:03:27.880> it's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
probably lost a little bit of time it's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.240 
probably lost a little bit of time it's
a<00:03:28.120> half<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.480> second<00:03:28.840> not<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> big<00:03:29.860> deal<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.100> think

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
