00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
create something more like this that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
create something more like this that
actually<00:00:39.360> sweeps<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> side<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> does

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
actually sweeps to the side and does

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.979 
actually sweeps to the side and does

when I release this watch how it just

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.889 
when I release this watch how it just
went<00:01:49.409> short<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> long<00:01:50.750> oscillate

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
went short to long oscillate

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.620 
went short to long oscillate
okay<00:01:52.409> now<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.040> helps<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.090> cutting<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
okay now that helps you not cutting this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
okay now that helps you not cutting this
angle<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.140> by<00:01:55.320> simply<00:01:55.680> twisting<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> now

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
angle just by simply twisting it now

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.190 
angle just by simply twisting it now
we're<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.149> through<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> we're

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
we're going to go through and we're

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
we're going to go through and we're
actually<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> layer<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.369> angle<00:01:59.850> out

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
actually going to layer this angle out

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.719 
actually going to layer this angle out
so<00:02:00.780> you're<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
so you're going to do that with a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
so you're going to do that with a
blender<00:02:03.270> okay<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.350> watch<00:02:04.560> we're<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.890> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
blender okay so now watch we're going to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
blender okay so now watch we're going to
do<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> blender<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> angle

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
do with the blender you see the angle

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.350 
do with the blender you see the angle
once<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> you're<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.119> take

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
once I have that you're going to take

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.050 
once I have that you're going to take
diagonal<00:02:10.200> forward<00:02:10.590> sections<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> take<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
diagonal forward sections so I take a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.460 
diagonal forward sections so I take a
diagonal<00:02:12.569> forward<00:02:12.750> section

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
diagonal forward section

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100 
diagonal forward section
I<00:02:13.560> bring<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.610> over<00:02:15.060> now<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.990> this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I bring this up and over now I want this

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.620 
I bring this up and over now I want this
hair<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.470> start<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.830> swing<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.520> side<00:02:17.820> take

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
hair to start to swing to the side take

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.930 
hair to start to swing to the side take
your<00:02:18.660> bunch<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.500> place<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.490> bottom

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
your bunch here place that on the bottom

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.790 
your bunch here place that on the bottom
so<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> bunch<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:21.900> goes<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> bottom<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
so the bunch here goes on the bottom you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
so the bunch here goes on the bottom you
come<00:02:23.040> through<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.460> weave<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.760> shear<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
come through you weave your shear in and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.230 
come through you weave your shear in and
I'm<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:25.950> weaving<00:02:26.130> out<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.550> edge<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
I'm just weaving out to the edge just to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.420 
I'm just weaving out to the edge just to
soften<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.780> edge<00:02:27.900> close<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.650> backstroke

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
soften the edge close and backstroke

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.060 
soften the edge close and backstroke
open<00:02:30.150> close<00:02:30.420> backstroke<00:02:31.290> open<00:02:31.770> close

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
open close backstroke open close

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.190 
open close backstroke open close
backstroke<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.300> you're<00:02:33.450> taking<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.020> weight

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
backstroke so you're taking the weight

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.230 
backstroke so you're taking the weight
out<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.760> hair<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
out of that so that hair is going to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.330 
out of that so that hair is going to
move<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.810> way<00:02:37.020> leave<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.680> section<00:02:37.950> alone

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
move this way leave that section alone

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.480 
move this way leave that section alone
take<00:02:39.060> another<00:02:39.390> diagonal<00:02:39.870> forward<00:02:40.500> suction

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
take another diagonal forward suction

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.280 
take another diagonal forward suction
number<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:42.330> took<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.810> corner<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
number we took it to the corner of the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.910 
number we took it to the corner of the
eye<00:02:43.320> bring<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.340> section<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.360> over<00:02:45.920> take

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
eye bring this section up and over take

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.550 
eye bring this section up and over take
just<00:02:47.790> go<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.120> slightly<00:02:48.660> inside<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
just go up just slightly inside the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.090 
just go up just slightly inside the
length<00:02:49.770> weave<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.880> blunt<00:02:51.150> sheer<00:02:51.540> inside<00:02:52.290> this

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
length weave the blunt sheer inside this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.670 
length weave the blunt sheer inside this
is<00:02:53.310> helping<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.730> take<00:02:53.940> off<00:02:54.120> weight<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.530> look

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
is helping you take off weight but look

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.530 
is helping you take off weight but look
at<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.860> angle<00:02:56.190> I'm<00:02:56.250> cutting<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:57.030> short<00:02:57.390> too

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
at the angle I'm cutting it's short too

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.720 
at the angle I'm cutting it's short too
long<00:02:57.780> what<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.620> mean<00:02:58.770> Sam<00:02:59.100> take<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> look

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
long what do you mean Sam take a look

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.330 
long what do you mean Sam take a look
when<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.450> cut<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.990> push<00:03:01.530> back<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.190> going

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
when you cut this push back that's going

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.400 
when you cut this push back that's going
to<00:03:02.400> give<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.700> variations<00:03:03.300> lengths<00:03:03.570> but<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
to give you variations lengths but the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.770 
to give you variations lengths but the
angle<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.800> put<00:03:05.040> was<00:03:05.220> short<00:03:05.580> too<00:03:05.880> long<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:06.540> watch

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
angle I put was short too long now watch

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.370 
angle I put was short too long now watch
when<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.800> comb<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:10.050> hair<00:03:10.290> is

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
when you comb this out now this hair is

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.260 
when you comb this out now this hair is
not<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.280> much<00:03:11.310> weight<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.090> it

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
not going to have so much weight to it

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.050 
not going to have so much weight to it
and<00:03:12.450> now<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.080> going<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> start<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> swing<00:03:14.310> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and now it's going to start to swing to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.030 
and now it's going to start to swing to
the<00:03:15.090> side<00:03:15.450> okay<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.590> see<00:03:16.620> what<00:03:16.920> we

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the side okay so you can see what we

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.800 
the side okay so you can see what we
ended<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.459> just<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.000> simple<00:03:18.510> side

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
ended up with just a simple side

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.880 
ended up with just a simple side
sweeping<00:03:19.410> French

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890

now<00:03:20.310> look<00:03:20.489> how<00:03:20.610> short<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.030> took<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.570> can

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
now look how short I took this you can

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.259 
now look how short I took this you can
keep<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.170> as<00:03:22.380> long<00:03:22.620> as<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.890> want<00:03:23.130> I'm<00:03:23.670> really

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
keep this as long as you want I'm really

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
into these side sweeping fringes that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.840 
into these side sweeping fringes that
have<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.070> softness<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.670> then

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
have a little bit of softness and then

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.060 
have a little bit of softness and then
they<00:03:27.060> sweep<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.720> side<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.890> whole
