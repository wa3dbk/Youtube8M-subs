00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
don't really need to see that so let's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.910 
don't really need to see that so let's
skip<00:01:04.860> through<00:01:06.320> alright<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.560> easy

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
skip through alright and that's easy
