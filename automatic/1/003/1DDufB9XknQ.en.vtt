00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and look yet two different sizes you've

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
and look yet two different sizes you've
got<00:00:50.730> carpenter<00:00:51.120> ants<00:00:51.800> all<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.100> same

got carpenter ants all the same

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
got carpenter ants all the same
you've<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:54.239> termites<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> actually

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you've got termites then if you actually

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.979 
you've got termites then if you actually
see<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.000> term<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> straight

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
see them the term it's got a straight

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.889

pale about a quarter-inch these are the
the<00:01:18.540> workers<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.759> live<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> ground

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the workers and they live in the ground

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
the workers and they live in the ground
they<00:01:21.840> need<00:01:22.049> moisture<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:23.070> basically<00:01:23.670> eat

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they need moisture they basically eat

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.240 
they need moisture they basically eat

supplementary reproductive the termite

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
supplementary reproductive the termite
probably<00:01:56.520> does<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lot<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.270> damage<00:01:57.630> than<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
probably does a lot more damage than the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.830 
probably does a lot more damage than the
other<00:01:58.680> wood-boring<00:01:59.250> insects<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.509> would<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
other wood-boring insects which would be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950 
other wood-boring insects which would be
carpenter<00:02:01.320> ants<00:02:01.710> powder<00:02:02.340> post<00:02:02.579> beetles<00:02:02.960> and

carpenter ants powder post beetles and
carpenter<00:02:04.890> bees<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.329> usually<00:02:06.770> you'll

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
carpenter bees and so usually you'll

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.210 
carpenter bees and so usually you'll
first<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.220> those<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
first see those so

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.600 
first see those so

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
get becomes hard this is why when you we

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.460 
get becomes hard this is why when you we
do<00:02:57.250> termite<00:02:57.670> investigations<00:02:58.420> we'll<00:02:59.020> see<00:02:59.290> that

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
do termite investigations we'll see that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.370 
do termite investigations we'll see that
some<00:02:59.740> of<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.980> joists<00:03:00.580> are<00:03:01.540> damaged<00:03:02.170> and

didn't like those joists that could add

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.180 
didn't like those joists that could add
oil<00:03:06.490> Lattimore<00:03:07.180> those<00:03:07.720> joists<00:03:08.200> were<00:03:08.800> in<00:03:09.040> the
