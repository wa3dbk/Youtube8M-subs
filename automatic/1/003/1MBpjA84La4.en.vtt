00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.250
 how many years have passed since the last one 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.170
 Once I mean he has launched his own 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.289
 console with a new supermario game 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.360
 if it says exactly since June 1996 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.840
 when he came out in super mario stores 64 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.520
 but with nintendo 64 even 22 are 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.259
 the seasons that separate us from super 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.010
 mario world arrived in japan in 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.200
 1990 and only 4 months since its launch 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.940
 by new super mario bros 2 for 3ds a 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.410
 this bros primary news for wii u 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.239
 there will therefore be a problem with 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.130
 overexposure of course the team of 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.950
 nintendo and drove for the first time 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.270
 from masataka takemoto and supervised there 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.310
 would miss anything else from takashi tezuka 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.920
 as well as much higher from shigeru 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.540
 miyamoto doesn't seem to think so it is for 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.310
 this tried to bet 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.440
 probably on something of 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.210
 calming being sure that the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.190
 public would have appreciated another 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.320
 sea ​​game in 2d that after all is 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.600
 been a blockbuster both on and on 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.530
 of them and now on 3ds we see how it is 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 gone with this new edition 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.960
 the first feature that jumps immediately 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.399
 to the eye of new super mario bros e 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.320
 obviously this is the first game 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.539
 of mario totally in high definition 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.640
 not all levels can be said 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.140
 succeeded in the same way one passes by 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.810
 realization all in all online 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.460
 standard with that style of the series a 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.049
 something more particular like this 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.579
 level we are seeing inspired by a 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.960
 van Gogh's famous painting though 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.259
 in my opinion it does not merge 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.270
 fine with with the game environment 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.280
 up to other stages much more 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.080
 hit the most successful ones from 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 see in their simplicity in their 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.270
 graphic cleanliness and obviously capable of 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.729
 refer to the mind also to that super 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.319
 mario world already mentioned above the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.440
 game of course you can face 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.060
 entirely with the ujw gamepad 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.150
 looking at it in the controller screen 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 whole to the whole adventure there are 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.329
 finally new game modes in 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.560
 which one can use or a character 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.720
 nintendo or your own we are 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 speaking mainly of the gods 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.390
 challenges that are difficult are many and there 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.850
 they will really push to the limit and finally 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.500
 the turbo mode in which you require to 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.970
 pass a certain number of levels 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.150
 as fast as possible with one 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.859
 obligatory scrolling that makes the rhythm 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.900
 really exciting and particularly 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:45.190
 difficult that even this mode is there 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.190
 really liked it a lot 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.550
 but always the characteristic 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.620
 main of every mario game and the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.840
 its level design and its being the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.730
 best is perhaps the ultimate game of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.590
 platforms remained all the more so when you 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.420
 expresses in a 2d environment like the whole 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.490
 saga of new super mario bros 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.380
 also in this case the level design for 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.630
 the note turns out to be much finer 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.550
 that the nem usic mario bros 2 for 3ds 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.470
 here there are no filling levels e 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.330
 rarely seems to find himself in front of 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.940
 situations already experienced above all 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.950
 from the third world forward the designers of 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.770
 nintendo start throwing at him 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.510
 player a set of found behind 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.870
 the other really never seems to end 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.350
 the ability of the team and the new of the 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.090
 new takemoto director to create new ones 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.330
 ways to test skills 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.990
 of new players also manticas 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.650
 game map that returns a map 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.540
 all-encompassing just like that of 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.540
 super mario world in which to jump from a 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.110
 point to the other with secret passages e 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.120
 even with a couple of forks, not many 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.550
 of course, there are plenty of exits 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.900
 secret as we are 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.820
 in this case when the flag e 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.020
 red indicates the pause face to say 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.630
 that 1 secret st is reached for 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.970
 reach a level otherwise 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.940
 inaccessible, and another course 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.830
 the focus of the situation is not alone 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.380
 get to the end of the level for 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.060
 how much all the obstacles that come 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.680
 put in front of players be 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.990
 however sufficient to make it one 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.320
 challenge rather interesting but also 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.170
 Collect all the star coins that 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.330
 they are scattered throughout every world 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.160
 they are three and only obviously getting them 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.050
 all will then be able to access the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.230
 end to a last portion of the game that 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.150
 in short, if you don't want spoilers, don't 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.980
 we don't tell you , we don't reveal it though 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.440
 it is quite predictable enough for 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.240
 anyone who knows the world enough 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.190
 of super mario how you see the ideas 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.320
 really many are born 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.780
 although the mechanics and structure of 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.480
 the game is absolutely not upset 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.970
 there are the classic levels there are the le 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.500
 fortresses of metamondo and finally there are 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.610
 clashes with bosses clash with the 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.620
 bosses that never reveal themselves 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.140
 particularly challenging as the other 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.330
 in the tradition even if at least in 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.300
 a couple of cases there is some effort 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.210
 to be able to make it all a little 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.770
 more a little more galvanizing a little more 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.750
 adrenaline in particular 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.030
 final clash with bowser was 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.590
 decidedly modified compared to 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.110
 level of difficulty offered by the new 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.490
 super mario bros wii but let that that 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.800
 be the one to find out 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.170
 obviously there are bonus sections in 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.870
 which is trying to collect lives o 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.870
 objects that can be extra objects 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.130
 use from the game map but not 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.290
 within the same level 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.100
 contrary to what happens in 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.270
 in versions for portable consoles 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.250
 here we have some examples for 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.350
 the note of secrets and needs 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.630
 to explore all the ravines 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.880
 all angles of each level for 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.520
 try to bring them back home 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.770
 three star coins to take home 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.420
 three star coins must be made 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.850
 reference to all one's own 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.920
 experience of mario or players 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.260
 to mature a whole new one because as at 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.360
 usually the nintendo team manages to 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.470
 communicate through the game with i 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.240
 players in a splendid manner 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.140
 letting guess what it could 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.140
 to be hidden
