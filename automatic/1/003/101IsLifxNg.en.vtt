00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.230
 fascinate because I loved it so without 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.750
 more preambles let's start with the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.930
 ingredients and the day the preparations 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.420
 for light we will need a package of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.490
 biscuits or biscuits maría las 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.369
 that they get more easily too 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.770
 we will need a large cup of cream 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.259
 of milk a large cup of milk 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.410
 condensed three or four tablespoons of 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.930
 milú a glass of milk four to five 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.060
 tablespoons cornstarch or corn starch 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.910
 a spoonful of vanilla essence 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.910
 clear and an envelope of unflavored gelatin 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.920
 the preparation is very simple we are going to 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.159
 put our cream in the blender 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.549
 milk condensed milk 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.679
 two tablespoons of milo and a spoonful 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.500
 of clear vanilla essence while 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.649
 so much in a glass of warm milk are we going to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.959
 dissolve the unflavored gelatin and also 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.119
 the starch of corn or cornstarch when 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.350
 let's have this dissolved let's add it 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.619
 to the mixture that is in the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
 blender and we're going to liquefy the assembly 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.969
 does exactly the same as the assembly that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.799
 we make with the lemon dessert we are going to 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.259
 put in a refractory the size of 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.179
 our preference a base with the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.179
 Mary cookies or biscuits 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.090
 then we are going to add the mixture and 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.459
 then we are going to put another layer of 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.410
 cookies can do it with the amount 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 of layers that you prefer but have in 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.790
 account that the mixture must reach up to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.770
 the end is where we are going to spread 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.250
 the spoonful or the two tablespoons that 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.840
 they left us with milo to decorate and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.099
