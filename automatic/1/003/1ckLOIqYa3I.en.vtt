00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.210
 so you've also been very important curiously that you do not 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.780
 twenty-one 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 but if you convince him 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.039
 he was the most instructional character 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.489
 of birth is the only 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.359
 i surely many of the people avoid will ask or have they 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.720
 I have been asked 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.900
 titín step or why mussel the series because it said tuccio more than 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.779
 hungry the voice was going very well 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.960
 there I do remember perfectly that it was the first year of being a world 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.649
 the other character more as I tell you and at that time in the year of 80 and 96 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.260
 96 when I went to live atlanta I went to work for cartoon network 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.000
 for tnt 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.860
 When I came back from Atlanta, he started working as a director of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.950
 production 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.620
 percent in their ipsa inc another dubbing company the series of 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.060
 I was with those commonly done for a hundred see me 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.230
 where the godmother inter worked 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.400
 then when I enter as production director at sinsheim 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 comes the series tuccio more dt forgiveness of world zeal 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 percent 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.740
 when questioning 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.650
 the godmother calls me to tell me that nobody 2 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.430
 your character arrived 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 the series arrived 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.620
 but I told Carlos the owner qaa 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.420
 and he said no we can not call he's in the competition and he's in a position 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 important in the competition 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940
 we can not bring it here to the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.130
 to the company just to tell me 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 sorry I'm going to have to change the work of flights 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 I do not understand never before boyfriend I have no problem the problem they have 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.500
 you the organs 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.490
 and this Indian Maron 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.160
 by the way, reyero 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.220
 I was very struck by the tension 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.439
 because I said gerardo kings saw we have nothing 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.510
 in common 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.859
 the time close impressive 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.649
 I still have a whistling voice this signing then portillo and because 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 puts him up the naan is that he has changed tuxido maxi has become old 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520
 then the voice looks good 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.140
 but from then on it came back will be to have the voice of gerardo reyero is not a 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.249
 excellent voice 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.559
 the east me that's what happened then 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:21.079
 I did the first year and gerardo kings other than the next two 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.520
 and that by 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.910
 for that reason it was why I did not continue making other languages 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.790
 but messi well speaking a lot and is consistent 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.779
 in which it is divided into two camps, not the one it says is not that the voice of Genaro Vásquez 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.439
 it was the most lesson 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.140
 ken keen who bad luck they changed it 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.889
 and I suppose there will be someone who says peace 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.579
 although good that they removed the voice of genaro now if the voice of gerardo 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.060
 herrera 6 and he won chile goes to the character 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.879
 taste breaks genres 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.599
 but well that's the best that's what happened so why not 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.469
 continue 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.549
 but they keep writing and they keep talking to me 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.379
 about this character 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.779
 and something curious that they have time that 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.639
 I do not know what you have, I'm not going to love you with the elections in Mexico 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.769
 do not say do not worry 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.669
 but we are talking about 15 years ago then in children 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.130
 what 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.079
 they were between 10 and 15 years old who saw a bowl 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.079
 now they are between 25 and 30 years old 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.480
 it is ok in another order another roll or not as we say in Mexico 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:32.149
 of course they are in another level they remember their childhood through giving a blow d by 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.079
 hundred 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.510
 is to be a 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.559
 they were big fans of series the common 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:43.699
 but now they have 25 years old things and it is not very interesting by the way it is not 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.889
 true 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.780
 giselle this was 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.040
 but well, they are already young, they are not young, so this is all 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.589
 this 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.859
 this change 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.149
 now you are in front of a microphone 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.149
 percent I think you're studying communications not 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.350
 good to one I'm cheering troya finished sixth and 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.440
 I'm going nowhere - the communications I'm enjoying is 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.910
 ready this genre of terror in the stock market and it has its headquarters 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.620
 they are people to whom it is already a step in history 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.620
 power is being handed over to those of us who were once in power 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.109
 call it like that 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.229
 the one that on stage now it's up to you not to buster take the baton 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.860
 you are the ones who understand to have the economic power are those who are going to 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.870
 buy the ones that are going to say the ones that are going to decide the ones that are going to communicate 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.790
 are the ones that are placing one 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.760
 people are still 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.300
 taking a presence in the world 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.879
 I love us because we already started to say what the fort insia not that we 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:46.830
 he had to record it 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.189
 There are people of my age who follow mexico and keep recording and they are great 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.300
 actors and they continue to produce 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.770
 per cent the mind and and asses and television series caricature cardboard if all 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.789
 this does not 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.969
 i this but it's your turn not 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.439
 and thanks to that he had a lot of contact 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.680
 with young people who have told me rajoy and it feels half ugly but it feels nice 

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:10.650
 what vicens 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.580
 but if I grew up with your voice so you make sure that your reference is the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.610
 correct the silver I think that he himself who accept it are 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.490
 + d dc almost 20 years in trouble 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.330
 of the dubbing I'm in nation when I started in dubbing and I did not speak 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.729

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:32.400
 peking 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.620
 of a time to this part of reality before the parade 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.949
 talking about if you did not talk to me anymore 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.490

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.689

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.939

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.969
 suffering maybe her first match said yes with a group of friends 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.620

 initially the sentinel 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.369
