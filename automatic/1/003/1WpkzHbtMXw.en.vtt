00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.880 

and<00:00:11.010> now<00:00:11.220> I<00:00:11.610> had<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.270> request<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.260> show<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:13.860> of

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
and now I had a request to show some of

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.090 
and now I had a request to show some of
the<00:00:14.100> NYX<00:00:14.370> blushes<00:00:14.940> side-by-side<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.530> these

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the NYX blushes side-by-side and these

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100 
the NYX blushes side-by-side and these
are<00:00:17.250> tones<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.880> could<00:00:18.029> work<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.480> contouring

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
are tones that could work for contouring

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.380 
are tones that could work for contouring
now<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.040> depends<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.670> your<00:00:20.790> skin<00:00:21.060> tone<00:00:21.360> is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
now it depends on what your skin tone is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.720 
now it depends on what your skin tone is
if<00:00:21.810> any<00:00:22.200> of<00:00:22.350> these<00:00:22.529> shades<00:00:22.800> will<00:00:23.100> actually

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
if any of these shades will actually

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.190 
if any of these shades will actually
work<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:25.280> feel<00:00:26.280> that<00:00:26.640> these<00:00:27.510> colors

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
work for you I feel that these colors

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.140 
work for you I feel that these colors
would<00:00:28.619> work<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.039> contouring<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:29.789> they

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
would work for contouring because they

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.810 
would work for contouring because they
are<00:00:30.390> shades<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.170> brown<00:00:31.440> and<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.520> matte

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
are shades of brown and they are matte

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.640 
are shades of brown and they are matte
colors<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.720> always<00:00:34.110> work<00:00:34.290> best<00:00:34.530> for

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
colors which always work best for

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.189 
colors which always work best for
contouring<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.809> I<00:00:37.190> started<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:39.140> with<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
contouring and I started out with a

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.020 
contouring and I started out with a
shade<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.739> think<00:00:41.100> looks<00:00:41.280> best<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:41.970> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
shade that I think looks best as a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
shade that I think looks best as a
contour<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.649> would<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.980> taupe<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:46.100> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
contour and that would be taupe and this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
contour and that would be taupe and this
is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> cool<00:00:48.020> toned<00:00:49.020> Brown<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.110> that's

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is a cool toned Brown and I think that's

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
is a cool toned Brown and I think that's
great<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:53.309> shading<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.270> contouring<00:00:56.030> next<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
great for shading and contouring next to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.319 
great for shading and contouring next to
that<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.739> warm<00:00:59.100> shade<00:00:59.430> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.180> stone<00:01:02.329> this

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.080 

and<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.939> third<00:01:13.119> shade<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.869> chocolate<00:01:14.710> mousse
