00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all guys well found by 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.020
 francesco siciliani on a new video 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.760
 weblog ipaditalia.com we have seen 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.389
 yesterday evening 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.200
 what has generally changed in ios 9 per 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 ipad 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 today let's go into the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 speech 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 let's focus on the singles 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 functions that are in fact been 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.840
 updated that have changed in this 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 first focus the focuses will be anyway 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.099
 very short we go to see the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.910
 applications of the notes it was 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.599
 modified 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.599
 let's start right away 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.930
 then the application of the notes is 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.120
 changed from before it has improved 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.160
 certainly in all its aspects vi 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.309
 I show how I had already shown 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.410
 in the small preview of yesterday that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.090
 we like one of the things more 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.550
 important to go to 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.220
 draw but before that I have to see 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.570
 a little how it behaves in general 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.540
 then we first have the various 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.010
 folders then icloud or on ipad 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.020
 or we can go and create new ones 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.729
 folders to organize the notes this 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.530
 it's a very very interesting thing that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.960
 it wasn't there before 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.240
 then we have the possibility of course 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.820
 use the full screen note 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.800
 so still an interesting thing that 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.990
 allows us to peek a little between the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.190
 novelty is the classic form that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.830
 they will know some notes and then we have the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.470
 possibility of going to write and then 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.619
 to mark in the same in the same 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.990
 time so for example let's go to 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.319
 write a note we do test here 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.300
 there is the title everyone then for the rest there is 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.459
 already half-ready formatting 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.720
 so here we go to write proof 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.420
 here we have the possibility to do a 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.009
 cut copy paste or di 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.599
 quickly add lists 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.720
 pd test etc. is to go regular 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.680
 also formatting then 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.959
 first and foremost that the structure so use 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.940
 cavinata and then also title headings 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.709
 body etc. from here we can put 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.680
 a photo quickly and then we can 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.110
 go to draw without problems with 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.160
 several bernelli also available 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 various colors 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.970
 so we can really do everything 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.140
 what we want is that we also 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.780
 use a line for 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.850
 going to draw precisely what 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.350
 which I really had hardly ever seen 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.500
 already on drawing aggregation then 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.319
 also have it in default on icloud 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.880
 in short, only on ipad and interesting from 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.040
 here we have a chance to go to 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.990
 see the attached drawings to choose them 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.600
 in short, all of us can also 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.380
 export them otherwise also save them 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.080
 to images 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.150
 okay with the notes we have finished 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.570
 here I thank you for following 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.880
 this little focus on the notes for ipad 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.680
 we will meet again with the next focuses 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.459
 already today 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.000
 next days 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.000
 See you soon
