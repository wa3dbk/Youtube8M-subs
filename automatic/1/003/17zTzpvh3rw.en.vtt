welcome<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.170> Andrews<00:00:01.439> engineering<00:00:02.100> what<00:00:02.280> we

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
welcome to Andrews engineering what we

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.280 
welcome to Andrews engineering what we
have<00:00:02.669> here<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.179> our<00:00:03.360> three<00:00:03.629> phase<00:00:03.840> converter

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
have here is our three phase converter

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.950 
have here is our three phase converter
panel<00:00:04.859> don't<00:00:05.730> have<00:00:05.850> three-phase<00:00:06.390> available

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
panel don't have three-phase available

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.660 
panel don't have three-phase available
where<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.170> live<00:00:07.470> so<00:00:07.799> I've<00:00:07.950> got<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> generate<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
where I live so I've got to generate the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.030 
where I live so I've got to generate the
third<00:00:08.880> phase<00:00:09.179> myself<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.679> how<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> do

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
third phase myself and this is how I do

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.850 
third phase myself and this is how I do
it<00:00:11.450> there<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> three<00:00:12.719> phase<00:00:12.929> converter<00:00:13.410> panel

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
motor contactors right up here and we've

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.240 
motor contactors right up here and we've
got<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.210> time<00:00:40.480> delay<00:00:40.809> relay<00:00:41.260> right<00:00:41.649> here<00:00:42.040> which

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
got a time delay relay right here which

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.770 
got a time delay relay right here which
starts<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.910> motor<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.650> our<00:00:45.420> capacitor<00:00:46.420> relay

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
starts the motor and our capacitor relay

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.260 
starts the motor and our capacitor relay
right<00:00:47.050> here<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.680> then<00:00:48.640> we've<00:00:48.760> got<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:48.970> relay

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
right here and then we've got to relay

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.660 
right here and then we've got to relay
down<00:00:49.510> here<00:00:49.899> which<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:50.860> controlled<00:00:51.400> with<00:00:51.580> the

two starter capacitors which we've

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.040 
two starter capacitors which we've
calculated<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.850> correct<00:00:58.000> capacitance<00:00:58.870> to
