00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.030
 the job is actually to organize the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 work of my collaborators who are 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 the naturalistic guards of the site and whose 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.760
 the missions are quite varied but 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.470
 actually revolves around the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.460
 preservation and enhancement 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.229
 natural heritage 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.489
 it had been found that 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.710
 one hundred and ten thousand people 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.049
 today records a frequenting the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.540
 site of arjuzanx come on 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.900
 equipment that was either very 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.310
 obsolete sometimes even nonexistent and that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.040
 the majority of visitors wished to have 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.700
 activities to be carried out on 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700
 speakers 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.100
 I 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.980
 the whole project that took place 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.170
 so for a year amounts to 5.5 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.360
 million euros excluding taxes the project 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.550
 landscaping regarding does the lake 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.940
 of arjuzanx which is one of the water bodies of 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.220
 site 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.870
 it's the largest it spans 140 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.270
 its readers and this is the water plan that 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.940
 for several years is open to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.550
 public for the practice of the activities of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.980
 full nature on the main door 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.050
 access to the site so beach side the idea 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.270
 is to capture all visitor flows 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.290
 who also come from arjuzanx that this 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 is actually for the part 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.640
 nature discovery but also for 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.240
 practical parts of nature and 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.430
 to situate on the path of 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 visitors a host house that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.510
 actually allows to inquire from 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.970
 find out about the richness of the site 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.490
 today but discover its history 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.240
 through effectively the story 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.500
 mining is at the origin of the mine 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.640
 the lean it present in the basement 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.010
 landais that was actually 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.830
 operate and on the opposite bank 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.500
 magic side another layout that is 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.400
 plus a nature discovery pole in on 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 interpretive trails 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.140
 I am me on the site of arjuzanx 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.879
 since the creation of the mixed union 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 actually I saw a site that small 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.560
 to small always evolves in term of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.620
 landscape is a site that is 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.299
 relatively young but who also took 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.049
 importance in terms of 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.079
 attendance 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.430
 so we have been working for many 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.430
 years on actually the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.010
 developing a project with a big 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.510
 challenge that is that actually this 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.700
 layout that we realize 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.040
 they actually serve our 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.650
 mission which is the valuation of the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.879
 natural heritage but also historic 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.560
 one on the occurrence for the site 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.620
 d'arjuzanx is a great game on this 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.690
 site where for years edf were 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.849
 present at the beginning of edf becoming 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.530
 was very uncertain and people 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.209
 have been waiting and 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.639
 years that things are happening 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.750
 so it's interesting to see 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.909
 that today things have 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.319
 realized that people are waiting 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.709
 now with great impatience 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.889
 its reopening and that actually they 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.540
 can generate something in term 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.540
 of territorial dynamism
