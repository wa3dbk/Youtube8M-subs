00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.099
 My name is Cossacks Dmitri I am sports 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540
 rehabilitation therapist and master trainer powerhouse 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.679
 gym 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 today i would like to talk about 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.890
 spinal column muscles 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 and such a diagnosis as protrusion 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 intervertebral discs what is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.359
 intervertebral disc protrusion 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.269
 when the muscles of the spine are very 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.940
 weak and the vertebrae are very hard on 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.270
 each other and squeeze intervertebral 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.500
 disk 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.140
 thus, they affect various nerves and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 back pains appear and today we 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.940
 would like to talk about what can 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.829
 do exercise 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 stretching the spine and to strengthen 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.480
 spinal column muscles first 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 exercise we will have hyperextension with 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.360
 Ie there is an exercise 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.440
 classic when but performed 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.109
 classic style that is just hands 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.559
 head down the body down we will 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.060
 do a little different interpretation 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.590
 strongly on the Arabs prominent back muscles 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.960
 let's go fix the body take the weight 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 small 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 I lift the body and cut the diamond 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.640
 muscles we connect the shoulder blades here such here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.369
 this style will do it 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 stretched spine relaxed and 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.950
 We rise and reduce the blades in order 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.829
 most giving even stronger emphasis on 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.119
 rhomboid muscles that contribute 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.850
 straight posture, even back 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 since the 21st century we have a sedentary image 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.930
 life and the people constantly sit at 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.259
 computer write something typing back 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.590
 bent and posture is always with us 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.409
 wrong therefore goes very big 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.719
 load on the sagittal plane on 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.119
 spinal discs 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:09.079
 so it is in this style 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.079
 doing this exercise 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.020
 omitted together 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.250
 pull up the birch as much as possible 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:31.140
 straightened back and dropping many down 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 rounded back and up and down more 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 you can do a little different 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:45.050
 interpretations that is when we omit yet 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.050
 legs to the bottom down there down and up 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:54.540
 down were lumbar and went legs 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:00.209
 further very good pulls 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.480
 spine this exercise yet it 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.340
 the exercise is done more isolated on 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.459
 each leg to stretch the sciatic 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.660
 nerves therefore we will do more 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.660
 separate each leg 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.080
 just keeping your leg down 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:28.210
 stretched relaxed the knife and lower it 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:32.140
 down and once caught the label once and again 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.140
 we try not to tear the back 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.290
 OK 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.650
 enough now we will do 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.020
 just directly that is with 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.840
 a trainer with me will do stretching 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.710
 on the rug already be directly I 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:08.200
 pull the person and pull the muscles 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:12.190
 the spine was originally a stretching affair 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.440
 spine for hands with relax 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.840
 maximum back to stretch 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:23.520
 lumbar thoracic 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.290
 we pull up also all muscles completely 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.150
 interconnected with each other and in that 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.000
 the number of spinal muscles is very 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.490
 tied to the legs so as fully 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.710
 all the spine pass the extra spine 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.310
 nerves like that which will be further in 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.190
 legs so hips biceps 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.730
 muscles too, be sure to pull after 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.730
 workout 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.169
 and another new one 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:05.250
 0 and sho turn over also 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.580
 warm the lower back and completely along 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.710
 all the muscles of the spine are muscles 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:17.879
 steel became elastic and could their 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:21.860
 stretch any range of motion all 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.860
 now pull hands forward 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.090
 loosened pulling up 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.090
 thereby stretching and 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:38.610
 spine and chest lift 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:45.300
 muscles at the same time and for the hands still do 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:47.750
 Stretching for the voice and not smoothly raise 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.750
 in excess of 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.710
 and pivot on its side and make 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:05.720
 another stretch on the lumbar 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:11.420
 spoon bend at the knee hand here all 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:15.640
 back relaxed and a little bit 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.200
 we pull out such stretches 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:23.410
 do not need much pressure 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.410
 just pulls on the other side also 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:35.399
 leg bent at the knee and relax and 

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:38.589
 give freedom of vertebra 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.209
 as you understood we did today 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:43.079
 a small set of exercises for 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:45.999
