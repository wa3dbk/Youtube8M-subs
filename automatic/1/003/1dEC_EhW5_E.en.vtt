00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.279 

so<00:04:48.560> as<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:49.430> probably<00:04:49.460> saw<00:04:50.120> there<00:04:50.419> what<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.110> was

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
so as you probably saw there what I was

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.140 
so as you probably saw there what I was
doing<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:52.129> was<00:04:52.219> taking<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.699> brush<00:04:52.939> and

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
doing is I was taking the brush and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.879 
doing is I was taking the brush and
every<00:04:53.360> time<00:04:53.539> I<00:04:53.659> brushed<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:54.050> would<00:04:54.199> pick<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.710> up

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
every time I brushed I would pick it up

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.189 
every time I brushed I would pick it up
and<00:04:55.310> make<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.550> on<00:04:55.759> its<00:04:55.909> side<00:04:56.090> because<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:56.840> way

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
and make it on its side because that way

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.990 
and make it on its side because that way
the<00:04:57.379> hair<00:04:57.530> wouldn't<00:04:57.770> get<00:04:58.009> out<00:04:58.189> as<00:04:58.370> easily<00:04:58.789> and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
the hair wouldn't get out as easily and

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.909 
the hair wouldn't get out as easily and
when<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.180> pulled<00:04:59.539> I<00:04:59.780> would<00:04:59.990> have<00:05:00.139> time<00:05:00.439> for<00:05:00.800> the

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
when I pulled I would have time for the

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.939 
when I pulled I would have time for the
hairdryer<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.550> go<00:05:01.699> and<00:05:02.150> follow<00:05:02.599> the<00:05:03.080> brush<00:05:03.319> now

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949
