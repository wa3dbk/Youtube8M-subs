from<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.910> movie<00:02:15.180> didn't<00:02:15.450> they

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
from this movie didn't they

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.320 
from this movie didn't they
so<00:02:16.170> does<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.350> make<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> landing<00:02:16.860> bad

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330

so does that make a landing bad
necessarily<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.720> anything<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.350> makes<00:02:19.560> it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
necessarily if anything it makes it

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.590 
necessarily if anything it makes it
unique<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.610> very<00:02:20.760> different<00:02:21.000> tape<00:02:21.360> that

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
unique it's a very different tape that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.390 
unique it's a very different tape that
Disney<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.050> trying<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.440> do<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.950> apparently

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
Disney was trying to do and apparently

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
Disney was trying to do and apparently
it<00:02:23.550> really<00:02:23.760> paid<00:02:23.940> off<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.600> jokes<00:02:24.810> Robin

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it really paid off the jokes Robin

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.960 
it really paid off the jokes Robin
Williams<00:02:25.530> makes<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.980> funny<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.520> despite<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
Williams makes is funny and despite the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.700 
Williams makes is funny and despite the
fact<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.510> doesn't<00:02:27.660> look<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:27.990> Arabia<00:02:28.500> it

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
fact that it doesn't look like Arabia it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.040 
fact that it doesn't look like Arabia it
still<00:02:29.070> looks<00:02:29.370> great<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:30.480> colors<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.930> this
