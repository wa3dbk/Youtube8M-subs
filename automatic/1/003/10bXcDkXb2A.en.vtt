 great pleasure here I want to teach you 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.440
 basically a couple of things that we're 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.630
 announcing today itself is the first one is 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.100
 this new this new application that is 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.020
 call bring though you can install in 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.070
 your phone the operating system of 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.390
 android or apple ios generally 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.710
 when you buy a car you do not have to 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.020
 pay a large amount of money for 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 have the navigation system be 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.730
 included in your car but with this 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.339
 simply buy the application of the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.220
 phone costs less than $ 100 the 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.410
 you install and you basically have a 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.330
 projection on the screen of the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.989
 then very easy navigation very 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.180
 cheap that the customers of our 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.670
 cars love something else that they 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.120
 I want to teach obviously this is what 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.080
 We are announcing today that he is Chilean 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.650
 basically and it's the first integration 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.810
 also this with the agreement with a 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.520
 company of the automotive industry and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.740
 they have to soon seventy thousand 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.150
 stations around the world then I 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.190
 I can be in Barcelona listening to a 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.130
 mexico song from japan 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.220
 what has been heard in a station 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.020
 local in Spain and I can squeeze 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.850
 this button and it's something you can not do 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.260
 this on your cell phone with the application of 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.830
 chone but it can not be in your car 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.710
 basically press 7 button and it's going to 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.940
 look for something that the system thinks of 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.160
 smart way that you are going to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 like it because in really what it does 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.750
 what they do is prevent you from having to 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.090
 manipulate the phone everything is done from 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.760
 from this resistive screen here 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.370
 pressing the clear that if they also go 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.350
 to pass this all you know your 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.060
 Favorites search for them by gender but 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.310
 As you say , we do not treat it 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.830
 implement so that it will be safe and 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.290
 easy to control the connection is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 performed by a bluetooth cable and sorry 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.440
 for a bluetooth wireless connection and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 by a usb cable 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.660
 we know right now I'm just going to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.880
 being able to do in English this is something that 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.040
 Our customers who have bought a 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.650
 smartphone are they have mayling can 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.060

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.060
 I'm driving I press this button 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.569
 and then ask a serious question 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.819
 lay was approached has not taken 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.099
 effectively christensen 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.840

 appointments I have today sends a message of 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.329
 text everything in a very safe way 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.219
 while you are with your eyes to the 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.760
 front and without without seeing your 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.079
 phone 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.780
 now if you were to ask 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.879
 take me to a web page or something 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.500
 write intelligently to say 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.250
 which can not be for reasons of 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.840
 security 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.419
