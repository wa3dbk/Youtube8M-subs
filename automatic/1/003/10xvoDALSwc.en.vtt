00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.850
 easy profits 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.310
 We are still divided opinions 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.310

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 then it is so when daniel sinks that 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.829
 characteristic of his singing is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.710
 it modulates the tone indeed the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.850
 phonetics modulates the phonetics rather yes 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 are for example 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.790
 it 's not like heather greene but 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.790

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 more 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:37.880
 Didgeridoo grew up and when she did 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.370
 If you are attentive yesterday the media 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.570

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.100

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.600

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.239
 frank sinatra, that's very true 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.620
 similar to daniel's is like that and when 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.030
 can not imagine that 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.040
 then you already have the chance 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.040
 to hear about how the sounds 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.970
 first a little bit 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.970
 wear like daniel 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
 dpa 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.440

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800
 Fri. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.870
 Vienna 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.950
 that must be the surprise effect 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.030
 bigger is my ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.030

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.140
 a 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.640
 not out 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.640
 very beautiful 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:42.260
 so just read the text by yes 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:42.260
 just like the end, do not forget 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.500
 imagine if daniel may way sings that 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.500
 it sounds like that about the same 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.179
 mp 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:52.020
 6 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.020
 Roger Zedi 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.920
 it was flowing 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.150
 I was 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.430
 in 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.660
 there 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.660
 something like that can be imagined at 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.199
 next time germany is looking for the 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:13.070
 superstar do not watch them get it 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:13.759
 not again so that he might 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.810
 exhausting 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.590
 sounds like the as rom has to behave 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.289
 shot 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.710
 there can not have no air 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:26.750
 more to sing, why dare me 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:33.169
 really just the right fit 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:35.050
 together to the Do not fuck because 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:40.120
 there is the fact that the fat knows 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.120
 therefore for the fit stays right
