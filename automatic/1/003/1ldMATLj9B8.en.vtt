wraiths arm and crush that and thank God
for<00:04:28.530> those<00:04:28.680> nukes<00:04:28.950> on<00:04:29.190> nukes<00:04:29.580> they<00:04:30.540> look

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
for those nukes on nukes they look

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.790 
for those nukes on nukes they look
usable<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:32.100> not<00:04:32.340> just<00:04:32.520> against<00:04:32.820> machine<00:04:33.800> I

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
usable and not just against machine I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.659 
usable and not just against machine I
think<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:36.479> next<00:04:36.750> look<00:04:37.010> they<00:04:38.010> look<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.250> same<00:04:38.280> I

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
think the next look they look the same I

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.820 
think the next look they look the same I
mean<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:38.910> didn't<00:04:39.120> kill<00:04:39.270> Nexus<00:04:39.780> that's<00:04:40.560> true<00:04:40.800> i

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
mean it didn't kill Nexus that's true i

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.100 
mean it didn't kill Nexus that's true i
mean<00:04:40.979> it<00:04:41.310> look<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.550> somebody's<00:04:42.060> butt<00:04:42.450> just

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
mean it look like somebody's butt just

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.300 
mean it look like somebody's butt just
seems<00:04:43.290> like<00:04:43.410> they're<00:04:43.560> much<00:04:43.830> lower<00:04:44.040> tech

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
seems like they're much lower tech

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.250 
seems like they're much lower tech
easier<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.910> get<00:04:45.030> out<00:04:45.240> yeah<00:04:45.810> i<00:04:45.840> wasn't<00:04:46.110> sure

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
easier to get out yeah i wasn't sure

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.230 
easier to get out yeah i wasn't sure
about<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.710> tech<00:04:46.950> because<00:04:47.190> i<00:04:47.340> didn't<00:04:48.120> really

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
about the tech because i didn't really

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.750 
about the tech because i didn't really
know<00:04:48.470> like<00:04:49.470> what<00:04:49.680> tech<00:04:49.860> train<00:04:50.100> was<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.580> don't

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
know like what tech train was on I don't

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.460 
know like what tech train was on I don't
know<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:51.360> be<00:04:51.479> honest<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.810> think<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.140> makes<00:04:52.320> her

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
know to be honest I think that makes her

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.020 
know to be honest I think that makes her
just<00:04:52.680> been

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
just been

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.700 
just been
same<00:04:53.240> as<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.480> starting<00:04:53.870> point<00:04:54.020> not<00:04:54.500> usually

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
same as a starting point not usually

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.470 
same as a starting point not usually
used<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.430> make<00:04:55.610> fun<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.820> people<00:04:55.910> are<00:04:56.330> not

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
used to make fun of people are not

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.200 
used to make fun of people are not
really<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.960> it's<00:04:57.230> an<00:04:57.470> actual<00:04:57.830> strategy

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
really like it's an actual strategy

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.670 
really like it's an actual strategy
seriously<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.690> know<00:04:59.780> that<00:04:59.960> game<00:05:00.110> was<00:05:00.290> always

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
seriously you know that game was always

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.860 
seriously you know that game was always
kind<00:05:00.920> of<00:05:01.040> like<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.480> think<00:05:02.480> the<00:05:02.540> Terran<00:05:02.810> player

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
kind of like I think the Terran player

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.210 
kind of like I think the Terran player
was<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.140> lot<00:05:03.320> better<00:05:03.530> than<00:05:03.680> with<00:05:03.770> Carlos<00:05:04.040> player

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
was a lot better than with Carlos player

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.960 
was a lot better than with Carlos player
yeah<00:05:04.790> David<00:05:05.240> Kim<00:05:05.450> so<00:05:06.440> he<00:05:06.920> probably<00:05:07.160> just<00:05:07.430> you

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
yeah David Kim so he probably just you

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.130 
yeah David Kim so he probably just you
could<00:05:08.120> be<00:05:08.180> whatever<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.540> wanted<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:08.960> seem

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
could be whatever you wanted to seem

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.990 
could be whatever you wanted to seem
like<00:05:09.170> I<00:05:10.100> don't<00:05:10.280> think<00:05:10.490> Nick's<00:05:10.670> are<00:05:10.820> going<00:05:10.940> to

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
like I don't think Nick's are going to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.080 
like I don't think Nick's are going to
be<00:05:13.750> more<00:05:14.750> control<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:16.370> would<00:05:16.460> be<00:05:16.580> fun<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.940> me

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
be more control it would be fun to me

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.790 
be more control it would be fun to me
yeah<00:05:17.450> looks<00:05:18.380> cool<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.860> big<00:05:18.890> red<00:05:19.310> light

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
yeah looks cool that big red light

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.779 
yeah looks cool that big red light
yeah<00:05:24.000> just<00:05:25.000> like<00:05:26.009> I'm<00:05:27.009> hoping<00:05:27.340> I'll<00:05:27.460> never<00:05:27.639> get

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
yeah just like I'm hoping I'll never get

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.240 
yeah just like I'm hoping I'll never get
to<00:05:27.849> see<00:05:28.060> that<00:05:28.240> on<00:05:28.449> my<00:05:28.599> on<00:05:29.110> my<00:05:29.169> face<00:05:29.500> yeah

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
to see that on my on my face yeah

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.450 
to see that on my on my face yeah
hopefully<00:05:30.669> not<00:05:31.000> but<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.389> think<00:05:31.659> you<00:05:31.750> might<00:05:31.900> um

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
hopefully not but I think you might um

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.760 
hopefully not but I think you might um
all<00:05:33.460> right<00:05:33.610> well<00:05:33.849> you<00:05:34.720> know<00:05:34.810> what<00:05:35.590> did<00:05:35.680> you

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
all right well you know what did you

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.550 
all right well you know what did you
think<00:05:35.919> of<00:05:36.129> the<00:05:36.550> actual<00:05:37.090> mechanics<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.379> you

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
think of the actual mechanics of it you

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.379 
think of the actual mechanics of it you
know<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:38.710> saw<00:05:39.009> a<00:05:39.250> lot<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.550> Units<00:05:39.849> pop<00:05:40.060> out<00:05:40.210> this

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
know you saw a lot of Units pop out this

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.700 
know you saw a lot of Units pop out this
game<00:05:40.599> unlike<00:05:40.870> a<00:05:40.930> lot<00:05:41.020> of<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.289> other<00:05:41.379> battle

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
game unlike a lot of the other battle

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.439 
game unlike a lot of the other battle
for<00:05:41.949> it's<00:05:42.069> a<00:05:42.250> lot<00:05:42.610> of<00:05:42.699> my<00:05:42.849> crowing<00:05:43.120> going<00:05:43.330> on

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
for it's a lot of my crowing going on

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.330 
for it's a lot of my crowing going on
stuff<00:05:43.750> like<00:05:43.810> that<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.409> think<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.889> starting

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
stuff like that you think that starting

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.980 
stuff like that you think that starting
at<00:05:45.430> one<00:05:45.669> skills<00:05:46.060> are<00:05:46.330> going<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.509> transfer<00:05:46.870> over

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
at one skills are going to transfer over

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.129 
at one skills are going to transfer over
very<00:05:47.259> well<00:05:47.319> whiskey<00:05:47.830> or<00:05:48.159> maybe<00:05:48.370> not<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:48.759> well

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
very well whiskey or maybe not so well

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.869 
very well whiskey or maybe not so well
from<00:05:50.139> that<00:05:50.229> game<00:05:50.590> that<00:05:51.039> we<00:05:51.190> saw<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.639> seemed

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
from that game that we saw it seemed

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.959 
from that game that we saw it seemed
very<00:05:52.419> similar<00:05:53.099> drug<00:05:54.099> ship<00:05:54.310> whereas<00:05:54.639> a

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:54.969 
very similar drug ship whereas a

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.800 
very similar drug ship whereas a
multitasking<00:05:56.340> if<00:05:57.340> you<00:05:57.460> can<00:05:57.610> get<00:05:58.569> a<00:05:58.599> couple

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
multitasking if you can get a couple

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.110 
multitasking if you can get a couple
drop<00:05:59.229> ships<00:05:59.500> and<00:05:59.979> drop<00:06:00.639> a<00:06:00.669> few<00:06:00.969> different

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
drop ships and drop a few different

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.659 
drop ships and drop a few different
isn't<00:06:01.539> same<00:06:01.960> time<00:06:02.169> it<00:06:02.319> seems<00:06:02.530> really<00:06:03.430> similar

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
isn't same time it seems really similar

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.300 
isn't same time it seems really similar
to<00:06:03.849> the<00:06:03.969> store<00:06:04.270> can<00:06:04.419> go<00:06:04.569> on<00:06:04.690> TV<00:06:04.900> p<00:06:05.229> soon<00:06:05.560> i<00:06:05.889> think

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
to the store can go on TV p soon i think

when<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:13.150> turn<00:06:13.599> out<00:06:13.750> this<00:06:13.930> way<00:06:13.990> but<00:06:14.169> if<00:06:14.979> a<00:06:15.099> lot<00:06:15.190> of

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
when I turn out this way but if a lot of

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.619 
when I turn out this way but if a lot of
games<00:06:15.430> look<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:15.729> same<00:06:15.879> way<00:06:16.060> like<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:16.569> I

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
games look the same way like that and I

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.089

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.629 
think a lot of starting our own skills
are<00:06:19.090> gonna<00:06:19.409> transfer<00:06:20.409> over<00:06:20.680> but<00:06:20.919> from<00:06:21.550> the

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
are gonna transfer over but from the

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.790 
are gonna transfer over but from the
other<00:06:21.789> battle<00:06:22.120> reports<00:06:22.539> it<00:06:23.440> didn't<00:06:23.710> really
