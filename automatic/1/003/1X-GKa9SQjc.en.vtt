the big fish tank and that means getting

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.840 
the big fish tank and that means getting
him<00:00:18.330> acclimated<00:00:19.279> we've<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> lights

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
above the tank the AI vega's are just

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
above the tank the AI vega's are just
really<00:00:24.029> fun<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> play<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.869> got<00:00:25.769> him<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
really fun to play with got him over a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.040 
really fun to play with got him over a
rock<00:00:26.369> structure<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.359> intended<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
rock structure just like we intended and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
rock structure just like we intended and
then<00:00:28.500> over<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> sand<00:00:29.250> bed<00:00:29.490> where<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.880> want<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
then over a sand bed where we want to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
then over a sand bed where we want to
put<00:00:30.330> some<00:00:30.539> pretty<00:00:30.750> intense<00:00:31.260> corals<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
put some pretty intense corals in the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.670 
put some pretty intense corals in the
future<00:00:32.399> we've<00:00:32.579> got<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> couple<00:00:33.180> Kessel<00:00:33.780> 360

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
future we've got a couple Kessel 360

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.400 
future we've got a couple Kessel 360
ends<00:00:34.920> those<00:00:35.700> Kessel<00:00:36.180> 360<00:00:36.780> ends<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.140> probably

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ends those Kessel 360 ends will probably

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
ends those Kessel 360 ends will probably
give<00:00:37.530> us<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> power<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.100> want<00:00:38.399> many<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
give us the power we want many of you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.600 
give us the power we want many of you
probably<00:00:39.809> remember<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> our<00:00:40.649> 55<00:00:41.160> gallons

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
probably remember one of our 55 gallons

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.459 
probably remember one of our 55 gallons
that<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.930> gonna<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
that look like this I'm gonna use this

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
that look like this I'm gonna use this
snapshot<00:00:43.739> picture<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.550> show<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:45.480> we're

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
snapshot picture to show you how we're

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
snapshot picture to show you how we're
going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> start<00:00:46.170> moving<00:00:46.320> corals<00:00:46.920> over<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
going to start moving corals over one of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
going to start moving corals over one of
the<00:00:47.700> things<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.030> decided<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> try<00:00:49.230> not

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the things we decided was is to try not

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.069 
the things we decided was is to try not
to<00:00:49.590> burn<00:00:50.280> them<00:00:50.550> quite<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.090> badly<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> try<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to burn them quite so badly is to try to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
to burn them quite so badly is to try to
place<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.800> areas<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> were<00:00:53.460> similar<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
place them in areas that were similar to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
place them in areas that were similar to
where<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.360> came<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
where they came from and to do that just

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
where they came from and to do that just
use<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> simple<00:00:57.180> power<00:00:57.510> meter<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.739> some

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
use a simple power meter and go get some

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.650 
use a simple power meter and go get some
values<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.000> they're<00:01:00.180> used<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> know

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
values as to what they're used to know

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360 
values as to what they're used to know
granted<00:01:00.989> they're<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.350> used<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:01.980> lights

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
granted they're not used to these lights

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
granted they're not used to these lights
in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.940> dream<00:01:03.210> tank<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in the dream tank and that's going to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
in the dream tank and that's going to
change<00:01:04.409> things<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.070> they're<00:01:05.640> certainly<00:01:05.939> not

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
change things and they're certainly not

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.750 
change things and they're certainly not
used<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> type<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> light<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.130> intensity

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
used to the type of light the intensity

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
used to the type of light the intensity
and<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.270> hours<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.930> even<00:01:10.500> though<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.680> using<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and the hours so even though I'm using a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
and the hours so even though I'm using a
power<00:01:11.340> meter<00:01:11.610> there's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.780> science

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
power meter there's a lot more science

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
power meter there's a lot more science
to<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.740> husbandry<00:01:14.310> than<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.729> taking<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.150> few

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to this husbandry than just taking a few

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.899 
to this husbandry than just taking a few
numbers<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.960> stick<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> coral<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> tank<00:01:17.100> so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
numbers and stick and coral in a tank so

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
numbers and stick and coral in a tank so
here's<00:01:18.090> our<00:01:18.240> dream<00:01:18.479> tank<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.200> see

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
here's our dream tank as you can see

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
here's our dream tank as you can see
it's<00:01:19.530> quite<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:19.890> different<00:01:20.340> than<00:01:20.369> our<00:01:20.490> 55

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it's quite a bit different than our 55

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's quite a bit different than our 55
gallon<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.710> we're<00:01:22.710> gonna<00:01:22.799> go<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.159> start

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
gallon and we're gonna go and start

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.609 
gallon and we're gonna go and start
place<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:23.850> corals<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> them<00:01:25.500> we

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
place some corals in it one of them we

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
place some corals in it one of them we
already<00:01:25.710> started<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> Duncan

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
already started with was the Duncan

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
already started with was the Duncan
colony<00:01:27.450> we're<00:01:27.689> moving<00:01:28.020> some<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.229> our<00:01:28.439> frags<00:01:28.740> up

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
colony we're moving some of our frags up

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
colony we're moving some of our frags up
and<00:01:29.610> we're<00:01:29.759> certainly<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> start

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and we're certainly going to start

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.940 
and we're certainly going to start
moving<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> our<00:01:31.229> clams<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> other

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
moving some of our clams and other

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.429 
moving some of our clams and other
critters<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.200> hurt

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
critters up to but we want to not hurt

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
critters up to but we want to not hurt
them<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.450> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
them not a lot of them can take this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
them not a lot of them can take this
intense<00:01:37.140> lighting<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> be

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
intense lighting so we want to be

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.550 
intense lighting so we want to be
careful<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.880> start<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.290> went<00:01:40.470> out

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
careful as we start in so we went out

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
anywhere online they work quite nicely

anywhere online they work quite nicely
you<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.070> know

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you know a little bit of you know

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
you know a little bit of you know
figuring<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.270> you'll<00:01:54.420> figure<00:01:54.750> out

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
figuring it out and you'll figure out

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.539 
figuring it out and you'll figure out
where<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> power<00:01:55.439> values<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.310> tank

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
where the power values are in your tank

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
where the power values are in your tank
at<00:01:56.759> different<00:01:57.090> locations<00:01:57.600> again<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.649> little

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
at different locations again a little

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.950 
at different locations again a little
bit<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> techie<00:01:59.460> side<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.180> remember<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
bit on the techie side and remember it's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.069 
bit on the techie side and remember it's
not<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.040> end-all<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.270> moving<00:02:03.719> coral

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
not you know the end-all to moving coral

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.080 
not you know the end-all to moving coral
and<00:02:04.229> placing<00:02:04.619> coral<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.490> certainly<00:02:05.759> can

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and placing coral but it certainly can

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
and placing coral but it certainly can
help<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.229> power<00:02:07.560> values<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.160> we've

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
help so here are power values that we've

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.470 
help so here are power values that we've
achieved<00:02:08.869> these<00:02:09.869> power<00:02:10.200> values<00:02:10.470> correspond

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
achieved these power values correspond

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.830 
achieved these power values correspond
obviously<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.780> tank<00:02:13.080> only<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.680> there

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
obviously in this tank only and there

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.900 
obviously in this tank only and there
be<00:02:13.930> different<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.379> your<00:02:14.530> tank<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.700> took

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
be different in your tank but we took

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.520 
be different in your tank but we took
this<00:02:16.209> picture<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.050> power<00:02:17.290> values

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
this picture of the power values

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.500 
this picture of the power values
compared<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.519> picture<00:02:18.730> previous<00:02:19.330> we

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
compared it to the picture previous we

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.839 
compared it to the picture previous we
had<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.959> then<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.590> started<00:02:20.950> moving<00:02:21.129> corals

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
had and then we started moving corals

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.020 
had and then we started moving corals
into<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.569> tank<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.050> similar<00:02:23.890> locations<00:02:24.790> at

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
into the tank in similar locations at

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.729 
into the tank in similar locations at
least<00:02:25.269> at<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.510> beginning<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.379> we<00:02:26.560> don't

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
least at the beginning so that we don't

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.680 
least at the beginning so that we don't
hurt<00:02:26.950> them<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.209> cool<00:02:28.390> way<00:02:28.660> of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
hurt them this is just a cool way of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.320 
hurt them this is just a cool way of
using<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.290> tool<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:30.099> help<00:02:30.129> move<00:02:30.670> things<00:02:31.060> from

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
using a tool to help move things from

using a tool to help move things from
one<00:02:31.420> thing<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.080> another<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.590> not<00:02:33.069> hurt<00:02:33.340> them

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
one thing to another and not hurt them

one thing to another and not hurt them
as<00:02:33.670> badly
