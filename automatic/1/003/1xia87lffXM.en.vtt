against the nature of tango the most

against the nature of tango the most
important<00:02:17.250> thing<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.880> tango<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.890> feeling

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.970 
think it's very important of course that
stands<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.850> case<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.120> tango<00:02:33.750> in

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
stands but in the case of tango in

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.760 
stands but in the case of tango in
special<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.930> most<00:02:37.140> important<00:02:37.740> thing

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
special I think the most important thing

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.940 
special I think the most important thing
that<00:02:38.010> we<00:02:38.330> need<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.390> translate<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that we need to translate to the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.360 
that we need to translate to the
audience<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.080> strong<00:02:43.530> feeling<00:02:44.130> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
audience is that a strong feeling that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.810 
audience is that a strong feeling that
we<00:02:44.850> feel<00:02:45.240> when<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.230> are<00:02:46.380> dancing<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.160> I've

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
we feel when we are dancing this I've

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.250 
we feel when we are dancing this I've
learned<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.240> lot<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.450> mean<00:02:48.660> I've<00:02:48.900> learned<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.230> lot

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
learned a lot I mean I've learned a lot

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.230 
learned a lot I mean I've learned a lot
of<00:02:49.560> tango<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> spent<00:02:50.550> three<00:02:50.730> years<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
of tango so I spent three years on the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.630 
of tango so I spent three years on the
head<00:02:51.390> being<00:02:52.260> able<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.560> read<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.490> be

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
head being able to read it and to be

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.880 
head being able to read it and to be
able<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.480> how<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.440> know<00:02:55.530> what's<00:02:55.740> actually

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
able to see how you know what's actually

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.290 
able to see how you know what's actually
happening<00:02:56.520> because<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.060> quite

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
happening because it can be quite

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.760 
happening because it can be quite
confusing<00:02:57.480> when<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.410> language

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
confusing when it's not your language

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.060 
confusing when it's not your language
and<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> had<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.360> study<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.890> now

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and so I had to really study but now

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.520 
and so I had to really study but now
it's<00:03:02.610> become<00:03:02.940> like<00:03:03.150> second<00:03:03.690> nature<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:04.200> think

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it's become like second nature I think

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.340 
it's become like second nature I think
as<00:03:04.770> with<00:03:05.340> many<00:03:05.670> other<00:03:05.930> traditional<00:03:06.930> forms

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
as with many other traditional forms

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.990 
as with many other traditional forms
what<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.739> always<00:03:08.040> tend<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.400> try<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.760> do<00:03:08.850> is

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
what I always tend to try and do is

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.420 
what I always tend to try and do is
bring<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.690> into<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:10.590> place<00:03:11.070> where<00:03:11.370> people

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
bring it into a place where people

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
bring it into a place where people
stopped<00:03:12.000> looking<00:03:12.390> at<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> from<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.930> traditional

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
stopped looking at it from a traditional

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.860 
stopped looking at it from a traditional
perspective<00:03:13.860> only<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.670> try<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.000> look<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.810> it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
perspective only I try to look at it

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.390 
perspective only I try to look at it
from<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.140> perspective<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.100> maybe

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
from a perspective that it can maybe

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.610 
from a perspective that it can maybe
surprise<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.480> times<00:03:18.810> really<00:03:19.260> suddenly

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
surprise you at times really suddenly

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.430 
surprise you at times really suddenly
make<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.250> look<00:03:20.400> at<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.580> differently<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.440> by

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
make you look at it differently and by

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.500 
make you look at it differently and by
using<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.010> plea<00:03:23.190> she<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.550> not<00:03:23.790> by<00:03:24.150> going

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
using the plea she is not by going

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.300 
using the plea she is not by going
against<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.170> because<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> cliches<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:25.920> are

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
against and because the cliches are are

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.520 
against and because the cliches are are
important<00:03:27.000> they<00:03:27.150> are<00:03:27.269> part<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.750> recognition

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
important they are part of recognition

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.009 
important they are part of recognition
they<00:03:29.459> make<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.760> understand<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.630> you

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
they make you understand that you

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.290 
they make you understand that you
already<00:03:31.170> know<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.860> then<00:03:32.430> from<00:03:32.610> those<00:03:32.850> cliches

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
already know and then from those cliches

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.900 
already know and then from those cliches
you<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.900> into<00:03:34.140> into<00:03:35.130> places<00:03:35.400> where<00:03:35.580> it's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you can go into into places where it's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.460 
you can go into into places where it's
there's<00:03:36.150> more<00:03:36.360> gray<00:03:36.570> zones<00:03:36.900> where<00:03:37.110> things<00:03:37.350> are

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
there's more gray zones where things are

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.440 
there's more gray zones where things are
maybe<00:03:37.650> more<00:03:37.709> complicated<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.700> our<00:03:39.000> reality

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
maybe more complicated and our reality

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.670 
maybe more complicated and our reality
today<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.959> relationships<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.650> very

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
today in relationships is very

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.890 
today in relationships is very
complicated<00:03:41.190> i<00:03:41.640> think<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.390> i<00:03:42.420> think<00:03:42.540> it's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
complicated i think so i think it's

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.240 
complicated i think so i think it's
important<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.590> show<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.239> complexity

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
important to show that complexity

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.760 
important to show that complexity
I<00:03:48.850> don't<00:03:49.850> need<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> feed<00:03:50.390> on<00:03:50.630> other<00:03:50.840> styles<00:03:51.590> in

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
I don't need to feed on other styles in

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.650 
I don't need to feed on other styles in
order<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.250> be<00:03:52.430> inspired<00:03:52.820> I<00:03:53.150> think<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.630> a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
order to be inspired I think I have a

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.170 
order to be inspired I think I have a
lot<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:53.960> inspiration<00:03:54.770> without<00:03:55.460> having<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.060> do

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
lot of inspiration without having to do

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.390 
lot of inspiration without having to do
that<00:03:56.390> what<00:03:56.990> I<00:03:57.020> am<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.470> curious<00:03:57.980> i'm<00:03:58.220> very

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
that what I am is curious i'm very

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.270 
that what I am is curious i'm very
curious<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.940> what<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.180> want<00:03:59.390> is<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.980> honor

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
curious and what I want is to to honor

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.730 
curious and what I want is to to honor
quality<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:02.990> see<00:04:03.200> something<00:04:03.500> that

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
quality and so when I see something that

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.890 
quality and so when I see something that
has<00:04:03.920> quality<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.580> that<00:04:04.700> might<00:04:04.940> be<00:04:05.180> kind<00:04:05.810> of

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
has quality and that might be kind of

has quality and that might be kind of
put<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.320> museum<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.980> lost<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.300> as

put in a museum and lost you know as

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.660 
put in a museum and lost you know as
being<00:04:08.750> some<00:04:09.230> sort<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.500> cultural<00:04:09.770> heritage<00:04:10.430> I

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
being some sort of cultural heritage I

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.940 
being some sort of cultural heritage I
think<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.330> dangerous<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:11.900> what<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> try<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.680> do

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
think it's dangerous so what I try to do

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.460 
think it's dangerous so what I try to do
is<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.340> bring<00:04:14.209> life<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.840> by<00:04:15.020> by

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
is just bring life to it by by

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.560 
is just bring life to it by by
challenging<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.430> challenge<00:04:17.120> these<00:04:17.299> things

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
challenging it I challenge these things

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.530 
challenging it I challenge these things
I<00:04:17.720> don't<00:04:17.780> just<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:19.579> know<00:04:19.609> feed<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.090> them<00:04:20.269> I'm

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
I don't just you know feed on them I'm
