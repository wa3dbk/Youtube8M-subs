actually squeeze squeeze this open or
squeeze<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.649> apart<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.810> give<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
squeeze it apart so that you give that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.830 
squeeze it apart so that you give that
about<00:01:21.060> sit<00:01:21.659> further<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.080> inside<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.649> cuts<00:01:23.840> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
about sit further in inside the cuts and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160 
about sit further in inside the cuts and
the<00:01:24.899> reason<00:01:25.080> why<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.340> helps<00:01:27.170> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the reason why you do this it helps to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.340 
the reason why you do this it helps to
install<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.890> variator<00:01:29.700> later<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:31.110> basic

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
install the variator later on your basic

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.510 
install the variator later on your basic
when<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:32.039> basically<00:01:32.069> giving

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
when you do that you're basically giving

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
when you do that you're basically giving
them<00:01:32.819> develop<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.390> slack<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.929> that<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
them develop more slack so that you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.789 
them develop more slack so that you
could<00:01:34.319> install<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.550> easily

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
could install a very easily

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.819 
could install a very easily
so<00:01:37.340> give<00:01:38.210> her<00:01:38.299> some<00:01:38.329> slack
