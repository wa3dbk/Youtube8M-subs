wanted to have a battle of gods kind of

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.199 
wanted to have a battle of gods kind of
portion<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.829> this<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.489> got<00:02:53.669> for<00:02:53.700> battle<00:02:54.150> of

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
portion of this all we got for battle of

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.550 
portion of this all we got for battle of
gods<00:02:54.359> was<00:02:54.510> kind<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.689> like<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.840> chibi<00:02:55.230> manga

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
gods was kind of like a chibi manga

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.110 
gods was kind of like a chibi manga
which<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.829> something<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.189> really<00:02:56.400> did<00:02:57.000> not

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
which is something that really did not

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.610 
which is something that really did not
resonate<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:57.689> people<00:02:57.840> people<00:02:58.139> wanted<00:02:58.530> an

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
resonate with people people wanted an

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.379 
resonate with people people wanted an
actual<00:02:58.919> amount<00:02:59.159> of<00:02:59.250> amount<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.549> gods<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
actual amount of amount of gods and it

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.670 
actual amount of amount of gods and it
seems<00:03:00.599> like<00:03:00.689> we're<00:03:00.840> getting<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.169> here<00:03:01.409> in<00:03:01.590> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
much this was a solid manga chapter for

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.199 
much this was a solid manga chapter for
me<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:14.129> is<00:04:14.250> interesting<00:04:14.699> to<00:04:14.729> see<00:04:14.939> that<00:04:14.970> they're

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
me it is interesting to see that they're

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.610 
me it is interesting to see that they're
actually<00:04:15.359> taking<00:04:15.659> somewhat<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.199> different

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
actually taking somewhat of a different

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.589 
actually taking somewhat of a different
sort<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.190> storyline<00:04:17.669> they're<00:04:18.359> kind<00:04:18.539> of

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
sort of storyline they're kind of

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.209 
sort of storyline they're kind of
skipping<00:04:18.870> some<00:04:19.139> important<00:04:19.709> events<00:04:20.039> in<00:04:20.099> the

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.219 
skipping some important events in the

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.279 
skipping some important events in the
manga<00:04:20.400> because<00:04:20.969> it<00:04:21.090> did<00:04:21.329> completely<00:04:21.779> skip<00:04:22.139> the

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
manga because it did completely skip the

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.300 
manga because it did completely skip the
part<00:04:22.529> where

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
part where

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.450 
part where
our<00:04:23.400> beers<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.389> we<00:04:24.630> swere<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:26.010> their

that<00:04:30.360> he<00:04:30.600> defeated<00:04:30.900> freeze<00:04:31.169> done<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.410> lot<00:04:31.560> of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that he defeated freeze done a lot of

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.320 
that he defeated freeze done a lot of
stuff<00:04:31.800> or<00:04:31.980> defeated<00:04:32.700> for<00:04:32.850> his<00:04:32.970> obviously

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
stuff or defeated for his obviously

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.180 
stuff or defeated for his obviously
trunks<00:04:33.570> killed<00:04:33.840> him<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.200> Goku<00:04:34.680> did<00:04:34.860> defeat

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
trunks killed him but Goku did defeat

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.220 
trunks killed him but Goku did defeat
him<00:04:35.370> so<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.060> don't<00:04:36.540> know<00:04:36.600> now<00:04:36.840> they're<00:04:37.020> skipping

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
him so I don't know now they're skipping

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.710 
him so I don't know now they're skipping
some<00:04:37.530> little<00:04:38.130> crucial<00:04:38.550> moments<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:39.630> know

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
some little crucial moments but you know

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120 
some little crucial moments but you know
it<00:04:39.870> will<00:04:39.990> still<00:04:40.380> probably<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.740> really<00:04:40.919> cool<00:04:41.070> to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
it will still probably be really cool to

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.590 
it will still probably be really cool to
see<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.550> guess<00:04:41.910> they're<00:04:42.060> trying<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.330> keep<00:04:42.480> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
see I guess they're trying to keep the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.270 
see I guess they're trying to keep the
manga<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.930> little<00:04:43.169> bit<00:04:43.260> ahead<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.800> anime<00:04:44.220> so

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
manga a little bit ahead of the anime so

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.010 
manga a little bit ahead of the anime so
that<00:04:44.580> people<00:04:44.820> are<00:04:45.000> not<00:04:45.389> discouraged<00:04:45.900> from

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
that people are not discouraged from

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.690 
that people are not discouraged from
actually<00:04:46.380> reading<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> manga<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.520> that's

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
actually reading the manga so that's

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
actually reading the manga so that's
going<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.850> be<00:04:47.910> something<00:04:48.150> interesting<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.600> see

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
going to be something interesting to see

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.940 
going to be something interesting to see
