00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
I have a sleeping pad here and this is a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.550 
I have a sleeping pad here and this is a
nice<00:01:24.820> sleeping<00:01:25.150> pad<00:01:25.480> this<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.900> thermo<00:01:26.380> rest

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560

nice sleeping pad this is a thermo rest
sleeping<00:01:26.920> pad<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.940> actually<00:01:28.150> inflates

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
sleeping pad and it actually inflates

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.250 
sleeping pad and it actually inflates
and<00:01:30.730> so<00:01:31.150> a<00:01:31.180> little<00:01:31.510> bit<00:01:31.660> like<00:01:31.810> an<00:01:31.960> air<00:01:32.080> mattress

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
and so a little bit like an air mattress

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.110 
and so a little bit like an air mattress
it's<00:01:32.620> about<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.950> thick<00:01:33.280> when<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:33.910> inflate

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
it's about that thick when you inflate

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's about that thick when you inflate
it<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.360> provide<00:01:34.690> some<00:01:34.870> nice<00:01:35.050> cushion

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530
