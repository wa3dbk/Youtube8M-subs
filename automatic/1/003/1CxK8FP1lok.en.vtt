00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 very welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 today we are going to work a very 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 interesting where we're not just going 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.519
 work the dexterity of the fingers but 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.650
 also the coordination of both hands 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.809
 let's start working by hand 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.550
 right on the accordÃ© of greater sun 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 as many of you know the chord of the sun 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.039
 greater is formed by these three notes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.350
 Sun, if it's going well, let's go do your 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.940
 investments that is to say placing the chord 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.340
 in its different positions 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.290
 and we 're going to appreciate it 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.690
 let's play instead of the three notes 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.880
 simultaneous that would be according to what we are going to 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.260
 playing arpeggiae means first a 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.880
 and then another and then another good this 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.710
 would this be the first thing we're going to 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.820
 do after we go to the first 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.050
 position that would be of the position that 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.150
 we just played up the bottom one 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.059
 up and we would stay this other 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.410
 position if king sun we will finish it 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.350
 so also appreciated 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.110
 next position would be to raise the if 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.130
 up and we would be the second 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 chord inversion 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.219
 we would not touch the precious one with the sun and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.759
 I continue and now we repeat what 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:20.899
 we have done from here the sun follows the 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.700
 first investment and we finish it here 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.150
 that is, we are going to do two octaves from 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.770
 this sun until that sun 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.770
 Now it's time to do it often 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.270
 today 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.960
 and after that, following the same 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 positions we are going to lower 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 do not 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.820
 i 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.660
 As you can see, they are the same positions and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.660
 same building when going up that when going down 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.200
 as always the goal of these 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.009
 exercises is still winning in speed 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.909
 then little by little practicing to 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.909
 that you are going up the speed 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.869
 when you 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.440
 well work with the left hand as 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.820
 you know, I always recommend those who 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.130
 you have less skill with your hand 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.300
 left to work these exercises more 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.340
 time with the left that with the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.710
 right to go matching with the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.550
 left we will work from the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.110
 same note that we start with the right 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.720
 then usually since this sun we have gone 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.720
 working in the downward direction 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:42.640
 let's play like this sun racing let's go to the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.640
 next position 3 and sun 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:52.480
 next position without sun 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.349
 next sun and if we will finish between 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.349
 yes 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.530
 we repeat this note to go up now 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.530
 the same positions 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.350
 and we go at speed 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.610
 the more speed the better and now it arrives 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.880
 a moment of making it more complicated than 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.200
 is to join hands with each hand a 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.720
 goes up and another low that is to say they go in 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
 counter movement 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.950
 the exercise is significantly complicated 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.060
 well to make the first note is not 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.880
 necessary to increase the two fingers 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.410
 we choose one of the two and we are touching 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:50.400
 same as before but with hands 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:53.140
 together each of the compositions 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 until we get them we let them go up and 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.870
 below we repeat and go down the same 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.840
 well and practicing the established 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.850
 It's going to cost you a bit to go 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.390
 practicing until it goes out and 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.380
 little by little, keep gaining speed 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.380
 finally we must stay something like that 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:34.300
 we can not trace the liver as much as 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.300
 staccato 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.160
 I recommend working on both 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.890
 joints equally the liver 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.510
 like the staccato and with this and always 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.940
 emphasizing how important it is 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.720
 are these exercises I say goodbye until the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.720
 next week
