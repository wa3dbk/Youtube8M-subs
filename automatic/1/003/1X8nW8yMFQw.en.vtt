the<00:00:24.779> internet<00:00:25.109> instead<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> using<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.130> metal

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
down inside just like that and still a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.410 
down inside just like that and still a
work<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.039> progress<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.789> still<00:00:48.030> need<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> figure

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
work in progress we still need to figure

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.900 
work in progress we still need to figure
out<00:00:48.570> how<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> make<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.710> screen<00:00:50.010> stay<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.550> other

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.740 
out how to make the screen stay up other
than<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.920> friction<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.750> clamps

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
than just with friction on the clamps

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.830 
than just with friction on the clamps
and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.370> more
