just asked that it be kind of like a

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.270 
just asked that it be kind of like a
general<00:00:32.809> theme<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.800> teacher<00:00:34.010> could<00:00:34.219> do

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
general theme so the teacher could do

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.319

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
what she wanted and she want it to be

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.420 
what she wanted and she want it to be
kind<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.629> a<00:00:35.690> shabby<00:00:35.930> chic<00:00:36.050> look<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:37.399> I

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
kind of a shabby chic look and so I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.590 
kind of a shabby chic look and so I
looked<00:00:37.640> around<00:00:37.730> my<00:00:37.910> papers<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:38.300> I<00:00:38.420> didn't

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
looked around my papers and I didn't

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.900 
looked around my papers and I didn't
really<00:00:38.870> think<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.109> had<00:00:39.230> anything<00:00:39.500> that<00:00:39.680> was

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
really think I had anything that was

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.389 
really think I had anything that was
totally<00:00:40.910> shabby<00:00:41.239> chic<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.949> it's<00:00:43.160> shopping

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
totally shabby chic and so it's shopping

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.790 
totally shabby chic and so it's shopping
and<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:44.300> not<00:00:44.480> convinced<00:00:45.109> this<00:00:45.230> is<00:00:45.410> completely

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
and I'm not convinced this is completely

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.439 
and I'm not convinced this is completely
shabby<00:00:46.160> chic<00:00:46.430> but<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:46.879> probably<00:00:47.059> about<00:00:47.300> a

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
shabby chic but this is probably about a

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.170 
shabby chic but this is probably about a
shabby-chic<00:00:47.870> as<00:00:48.199> I'm<00:00:48.440> going<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:48.859> get<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.000> what

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180

to<00:01:04.460> be<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.580> florist<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.210> roses<00:01:05.480> really<00:01:05.750> aren't

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
to be a florist and roses really aren't

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.600 
to be a florist and roses really aren't
my<00:01:06.020> favorite<00:01:06.350> thing<00:01:06.530> I've<00:01:06.860> seen<00:01:07.040> enough<00:01:07.280> roses

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610

to last a lifetime

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.780 
to last a lifetime
but<00:01:09.140> in<00:01:09.320> general<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.800> think<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.130> most<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
but in general I think that most of the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.280 
but in general I think that most of the
pages<00:01:10.970> in<00:01:11.300> here<00:01:11.480> are<00:01:11.600> pretty<00:01:11.690> even<00:01:12.110> if<00:01:12.200> I

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
pages in here are pretty even if I

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.360 
pages in here are pretty even if I
didn't<00:01:12.500> end<00:01:12.620> up<00:01:12.650> usually<00:01:12.950> no<00:01:13.040> one<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.250> all

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
didn't end up usually no one with all

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.090 
didn't end up usually no one with all
the<00:01:13.460> roses<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.210> anyway<00:01:14.510> I<00:01:15.170> wanted<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.920> show

I tend to think of shabby chic as having
a<00:07:47.280> little<00:07:47.520> bit<00:07:47.639> more<00:07:47.820> white<00:07:48.120> and<00:07:48.570> pink<00:07:49.820> but<00:07:51.680> no

matter what I try to do with the shabby
look<00:07:55.889> I<00:07:56.099> tend<00:07:56.669> to<00:07:56.729> gravitate<00:07:56.940> towards<00:07:57.599> vintage

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960
