00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
other side and then you do the same

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.950 
other side and then you do the same
thing<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.780> keep<00:00:37.140> switching<00:00:37.440> off

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
thing and you just keep switching off

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.180 
thing and you just keep switching off
grabbing<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> section<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.590> hair<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
grabbing the section of hair and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:53.450 
grabbing the section of hair and
bringing<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:42.120> side

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.580 

and<00:00:54.030> since<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.630> hair<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:56.190> medium<00:00:56.760> length<00:00:57.590> it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and since my hair is a medium length it

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.750 
and since my hair is a medium length it
won't<00:00:58.890> take<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.190> long

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
won't take that long

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:15.649 
won't take that long
it's<00:01:00.720> pretty<00:01:01.020> easy<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> do

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 

and<00:01:16.170> take<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> farthest<00:01:17.280> side<00:01:17.600> put

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and take it from the farthest side put

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.200 
and take it from the farthest side put
it<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.520> thing<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> other

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it over and the same thing for the other

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:37.850 
it over and the same thing for the other
side<00:01:27.320> over<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> top

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.999 

and<00:01:38.060> eventually<00:01:40.100> me<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.550> bottom

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.179 

it'll<00:01:48.700> look<00:01:48.850> like<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:50.610> fishtail<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:52.770> guess<00:01:53.770> I

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
it'll look like a fishtail I guess I

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.270 
it'll look like a fishtail I guess I
don't<00:01:54.789> see<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.299> I<00:01:55.600> don't<00:01:56.500> really<00:01:56.770> know<00:01:57.039> what<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
don't see it I don't really know what a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:16.530 
don't see it I don't really know what a
fishtail<00:01:57.759> looks<00:01:58.119> like<00:02:02.640> but

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.270 

and<00:02:17.080> then<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:18.360> grab<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.480> hair<00:02:19.720> tie<00:02:23.280> wrap

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
and then you just grab a hair tie wrap

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.830 
and then you just grab a hair tie wrap
it<00:02:24.430> around<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.849> couple<00:02:24.879> times<00:02:27.599> then<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.720> can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
it around a couple times then you can

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.309 
it around a couple times then you can
take<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.170> clip<00:02:29.379> out

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.670 

that's<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.099> you're<00:02:35.310> done<00:02:36.349> that's<00:02:37.349> what<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
