00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
you notice these sticks are a little bit

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.589 
you notice these sticks are a little bit
shorter<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.900> height<00:00:13.759> that's<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.089> marvels

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
shorter on the height that's the marvels

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.080

2 so you want to put memory stick in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.569 
2 so you want to put memory stick in
both<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.710> ones<00:00:58.890> before<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.340> start

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
both the all ones before you start

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.599 
both the all ones before you start
putting<00:00:59.760> into<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> black<00:01:00.449> ones<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.280> dual

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
putting into the black ones to get dual

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.649 
putting into the black ones to get dual
memory<00:01:03.300> speed<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.939> matching

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
memory speed you want to have matching

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.429 
memory speed you want to have matching
memory<00:01:06.960> sticks<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.210> case<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
memory sticks so in this case we have a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.940 
memory sticks so in this case we have a
memory<00:01:11.189> kit<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.240> sticks<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.470> guarantees

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
memory kit of two sticks that guarantees

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that both will be exactly the same I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.530 
that both will be exactly the same I
have<00:01:16.200> seen<00:01:17.210> memory<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.750> part<00:01:19.170> number

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
have seen memory of the same part number

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.570 
have seen memory of the same part number
where<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.080> buy<00:01:22.259> two<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.650> them<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.310> let's<00:01:23.520> say

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
where you buy two of them like let's say

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
where you buy two of them like let's say
you<00:01:23.729> buy<00:01:23.880> 2<00:01:23.939> 1<00:01:24.509> gig<00:01:24.720> sticks<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you buy 2 1 gig sticks and for the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
you buy 2 1 gig sticks and for the
purpose<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.790> making<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.770> dual<00:01:30.200> configuration

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
purpose of making a dual configuration

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
purpose of making a dual configuration
dual<00:01:31.350> channel<00:01:31.530> configuration<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
dual channel configuration but there is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
dual channel configuration but there is
either<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.990> slight<00:01:34.470> difference<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
either just a slight difference in the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
either just a slight difference in the
part<00:01:35.640> number<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.960> system<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
part number and the system will see it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.620 
part number and the system will see it
as<00:01:37.829> two<00:01:38.100> different<00:01:38.280> types<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.759> memory<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
as two different types of memory and it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080 
as two different types of memory and it
will<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> tool<00:01:40.560> channel<00:01:40.950> mode<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.430> if

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
will not go to tool channel mode so if

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.920 
will not go to tool channel mode so if
possible<00:01:42.659> by<00:01:45.770> dual-stick<00:01:46.770> set<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> kit<00:01:47.930> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
possible by dual-stick set or a kit so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.260 
possible by dual-stick set or a kit so
to<00:01:48.990> say<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.470> far<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.369> removing<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> memory

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to say as far as removing the memory

usually<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
usually you can just do a little bit of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.389 
usually you can just do a little bit of
a<00:01:55.590> wiggle<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.810> side<00:01:58.110> comes<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.130> pretty

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
a wiggle on one side comes up pretty

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.200 
a wiggle on one side comes up pretty
easy<00:02:00.979> pick<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.159> sign<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.640> looks<00:02:03.030> like

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
easy pick one sign up looks like

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.770 
easy pick one sign up looks like
conveniently<00:02:03.750> came<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.469> me<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.570> there<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.679 
see that this notch is going to match up
with<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.269> notch<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.939> board<00:02:20.939> you

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
with that notch there on the board you

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.630 
with that notch there on the board you
got<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.109> good<00:02:22.260> angle<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.519> can

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
got the good angle on this so you can

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.880 
got the good angle on this so you can
see<00:02:23.790> how<00:02:23.819> exactly<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.659> going<00:02:25.109> to<00:02:25.260> line<00:02:25.680> up

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
see how exactly it is going to line up

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.890 
see how exactly it is going to line up
in<00:02:26.040> there<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.299> matter<00:02:27.329> of<00:02:27.599> putting

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
in there it's just a matter of putting

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.679 
in there it's just a matter of putting
the<00:02:28.049> memory<00:02:28.319> stick<00:02:28.379> in<00:02:29.269> trying<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.389> get<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.659> a

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
the memory stick in trying to get you a

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:36.379 
the memory stick in trying to get you a
good<00:02:30.900> angle<00:02:31.109> on<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:34.700> hope<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> turns<00:02:36.150> out

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
good angle on it hope that turns out

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.059 
good angle on it hope that turns out
good<00:02:36.599> because<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.019> turn<00:02:37.290> my<00:02:37.409> head<00:02:37.620> and

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.679 

basically<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:41.579> through<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.090> click<00:02:42.540> it

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
basically just go through and click it

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.860 
basically just go through and click it
now<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.859> have<00:02:44.609> just<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.359> did<00:02:45.419> thought

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
now if you have just like I did thought

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.390 
now if you have just like I did thought
you<00:02:45.989> had<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.139> good<00:02:46.379> angle<00:02:46.590> where<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.159> lined

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
you had a good angle where it was lined

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.619 
you had a good angle where it was lined
up<00:02:47.549> it's<00:02:47.849> not<00:02:48.000> you're<00:02:48.239> going<00:02:48.389> to<00:02:48.450> get<00:02:48.510> this

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
up it's not you're going to get this

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.449 
up it's not you're going to get this
rocking<00:02:49.200> action<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:50.389> should<00:02:51.389> have<00:02:52.040> not<00:02:53.040> put

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
rocking action I should have not put

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.399 
rocking action I should have not put
that<00:02:53.489> power<00:02:53.790> supply<00:02:54.000> yet<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:55.049> look<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
that power supply yet they look at the

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.920 
that power supply yet they look at the
rocking<00:02:55.859> action<00:02:56.280> where<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.269> go<00:02:57.419> and<00:02:57.540> push<00:02:57.719> one

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
rocking action where you go and push one

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.509 
rocking action where you go and push one
side<00:02:58.139> in<00:02:58.260> another<00:02:58.560> side<00:02:58.859> kind<00:02:59.159> of<00:02:59.189> feels<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
side in another side kind of feels it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.580 
side in another side kind of feels it
comes<00:02:59.760> up<00:02:59.969> that's<00:03:00.659> because<00:03:02.629> you<00:03:03.629> can<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.109> see

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
comes up that's because you can is see

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.610 
comes up that's because you can is see
it<00:03:04.709> their<00:03:04.950> hope<00:03:06.169> you're<00:03:07.169> not<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.469> to<00:03:07.560> be

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
it their hope you're not going to be

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.780 
it their hope you're not going to be
able<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.299> notch<00:03:10.109> is<00:03:10.519> further<00:03:11.519> down

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
able to but the notch is further down

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.569 
able to but the notch is further down
then<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.030> want<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.389> to<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:13.219> so<00:03:14.219> I've<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
then I want it to be so I've that

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.439 
then I want it to be so I've that
short-term<00:03:14.819> memory<00:03:15.359> stick<00:03:15.599> around<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:18.030> put

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
short-term memory stick around and put

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.119 
short-term memory stick around and put
it<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:20.359> and<00:03:21.359> yes<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.049> did<00:03:22.260> do<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:22.409> on<00:03:22.620> purpose<00:03:22.650> i

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
it in and yes I did do that on purpose i

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.409 
it in and yes I did do that on purpose i
will<00:03:23.280> show<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.489> what<00:03:23.699> happens<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.150> put<00:03:24.329> the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
will show you what happens to put the

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.319 
will show you what happens to put the
memory<00:03:24.540> stick<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:25.049> long<00:03:25.260> i<00:03:25.879> made<00:03:26.879> you<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
memory stick in long i made you think I

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.000 
memory stick in long i made you think I
was<00:03:27.449> getting<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.049> correctly<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:31.109> normally

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
was getting it so correctly and normally

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.379 
was getting it so correctly and normally
you<00:03:32.069> want<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> try<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.459> put<00:03:32.669> even<00:03:32.970> pressure<00:03:33.180> on

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
you want to try to put even pressure on

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.920 
you want to try to put even pressure on
both<00:03:33.540> sides<00:03:33.870> by<00:03:34.139> doing<00:03:34.409> this<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.680> one<00:03:34.949> hand

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
both sides by doing this with one hand

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.009 
both sides by doing this with one hand
and<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.189> memory<00:03:38.189> should<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.639> snap<00:03:39.510> right<00:03:39.720> on

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
and the memory should just snap right on

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.099 
and the memory should just snap right on
in<00:03:40.259> or<00:03:40.650> click<00:03:41.009> in<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.310> should<00:03:41.519> say<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.870> should

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
in or click in I should say you should

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.719 
in or click in I should say you should
have<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.439> put<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.799> here<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.099> huge<00:03:44.400> amount<00:03:44.669> of

have to put in here a huge amount of

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.030 
have to put in here a huge amount of
force<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.840> you're<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.199> pushing<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.799> and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
force if you're a pushing on it and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.949 
force if you're a pushing on it and
doesn't<00:03:47.220> want<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.459> go<00:03:47.609> in<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.970> are<00:03:48.180> using<00:03:48.359> too

doesn't want to go in you are using too

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.809 
doesn't want to go in you are using too
much<00:03:49.109> force<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:50.159> could<00:03:50.400> break<00:03:50.669> your
