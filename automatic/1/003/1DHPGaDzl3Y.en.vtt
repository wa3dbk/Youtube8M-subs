00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 web video repair yourself in this 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 case the video is also dedicated to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.240
 home construction machines in this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.089
 case I want to present you a machine 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.730
 curved steel sheets or plates 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.140
 iron the same that is made 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.140
 entirely with materials 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.789
 Homemade that we can find in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.440
 any iron workshop or workshop 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.840
 of car or junkyard 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.900
 Most materials are coming 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.930
 of recycling in concrete the pistons 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.050
 used in the machine are pistons of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.680
 opening of car door that the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.270
 machine uses five pistons uses 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.490
 the opening mechanism 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.350
 of the bus door or the 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.350
 air distribution valve 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 to be able to distribute the air for both 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.770
 climb as to lower the pistons 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.150
 we see the whole machine back 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.640
 It is made with pieces of iron and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.430
 screws some of the pieces are 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.500
 welded we have on the side of the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.950
 machine 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.400
 some notches or positioning of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.890
 screws to be able to modify the height 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.229
 Maximum lifting machine in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.930
 this moment is without screws in the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.510
 laterals therefore rises to maximum 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.979
 height later of I will place two 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.810
 screws and we'll see how high 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.720
 raise 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.450
 the same once thought the sheet of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.220
 iron 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.830
 We speak 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.830
 and we would give the curved 90 degrees 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.210
 ah 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.049
 let's proceed to plug in the same and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.049
 see how it works 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.520
 we apply air pressure 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.500
 Y 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.500
 moving the valve 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.330
 we see how the machine rises to the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.330
 maximum height 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.550
 the pistons 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.100
 are caught in this position what 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.640
 would allow us to place the stage in 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.640
 lower part 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.300
 we focus the same 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.530
 we proceed to close the mechanism 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.930
 the sheet is pressed completely 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.440
 so we can proceed to the bending 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.440
 of the same 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.849
 we would apply the 45 90 curve 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.340
 degrees or the distance that will interest us 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.260
 if we try to move the sheet we see that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.980
 it is totally thought by the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.360
 machine can not be opened 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.540
 the distance that will be the machine 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.250
 a meter is approximately 10 meters 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 it depends on each one the utility that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.020
 I want to give in this case to be a 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.850
 home machine to use in a 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.390
 small workshop, you do not need a 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.500
 professional machine 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.500
 we laugh again 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.660
 it allows us to be the sheet that we have 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.660
 placed 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.520
 we will proceed to place the stops 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.970
 side so you can see the height 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.970
 works 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.910
 do not 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.880
 with this we will see 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.880
 how high it rises 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.070
 we see that it raises a lower height already 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.930
 that we have limited by the limits 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.760
 laterals and the elevation of the page 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.519
 just like I said a machine 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.840
 home construction made with 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.630
 material that we can find in 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.970
 any workshop a lot of material that 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.910
 we can find the scrapping with which 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.760
 do not use 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.400
 and that can give us a pretty service 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.009
 professional 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.100
 with a reduced cost and with a time of 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.920
 entertainment machine assembly 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.840
 I hope the video 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.260
 or was able to give an idea of â€‹â€‹how 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.790
 build a machine in a simple way 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.380
 and above all that you continue visiting the 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.380
 web page prepare yourself
