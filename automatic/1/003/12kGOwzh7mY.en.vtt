it<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.030> most<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> times<00:01:09.689> you'll<00:01:09.869> find

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it and most of the times you'll find

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.149 
it and most of the times you'll find
yourself<00:01:10.439> enjoying<00:01:10.770> it
