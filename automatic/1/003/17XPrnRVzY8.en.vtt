you can have an extraordinary moment of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.289 
you can have an extraordinary moment of
compassion<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> child<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> pet<00:01:48.060> or

whether<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.069> again<00:02:08.369> illusion<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.179> real

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
whether and again illusion can be real

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.580 
whether and again illusion can be real
it<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:10.020> comes<00:02:10.560> from<00:02:10.800> bar<00:02:11.160> wish

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
it just comes from bar wish

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.830 
it just comes from bar wish
but<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.280> think<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.730> reality<00:02:13.150> wins<00:02:13.599> out

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
but I think that reality wins out

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.170 
but I think that reality wins out
because<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.500> Sun<00:02:14.769> even<00:02:15.220> though<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.910> in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
because the Sun even though it's in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.839 
because the Sun even though it's in
spiritual<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.170> imaginative<00:02:17.950> Pisces<00:02:18.640> is

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
spiritual and imaginative Pisces is

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.970 
spiritual and imaginative Pisces is
forming<00:02:19.780> by<00:02:20.019> late<00:02:20.440> tonight<00:02:20.650> or<00:02:20.830> early

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
forming by late tonight or early

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.100 
forming by late tonight or early
tomorrow<00:02:21.250> morning<00:02:21.970> they<00:02:22.269> tried<00:02:22.750> with

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
tomorrow morning they tried with

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.830 
tomorrow morning they tried with
stabilizing<00:02:23.769> realistic<00:02:24.760> Saturn<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:25.810> I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
stabilizing realistic Saturn and so I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.960 
stabilizing realistic Saturn and so I
think<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.680> create<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.459> dream<00:02:27.760> in

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
think that we can create the dream in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.220 
think that we can create the dream in
our<00:02:28.120> mind<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.780> then<00:02:29.379> actually<00:02:30.220> move<00:02:30.489> toward

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
our mind and then actually move toward

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.119 
our mind and then actually move toward
manifesting<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:32.620> that's<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
manifesting it and I think that's the

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.550 
manifesting it and I think that's the
power<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.790> day<00:02:34.180> I'm<00:02:34.569> Rick<00:02:35.049> Lavigne<00:02:35.410> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
power of the day I'm Rick Lavigne and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.199 
power of the day I'm Rick Lavigne and
I'm<00:02:35.739> Jeff<00:02:36.099> shower<00:02:36.370> inviting<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.180> join
