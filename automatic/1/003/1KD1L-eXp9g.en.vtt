00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070
 sicotte 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.960
 I want to change my look a little 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 can wear it like that or by 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.039
 back to the freelance want to try 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.020
 something new then I 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.970
 prepared my fair play who is in the process 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.519
 to change 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.570
 I took out my had happened and nothing that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:32.329
 will protect my refusal of heat and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 my mind but for finishing 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.399
 so what I want to do if I'm going 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.550
 go give me a little bit of curls 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.420
 on one side just to do differently 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.950
 the important thing is palace until 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.239
 back because we have nothing there is not 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 necessarily need since I want 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's just a little movement in my 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.989
 motor in important things the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.340
 I have short hair 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.809
 be important to go in the same direction 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.449
 otherwise you will really make a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.520
 ball just one side and let's go it goes 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.289
 to be taking banks rather small 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.769
 so I go outward 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:10.439
 with more pc bands while that 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:14.510
 shown well and I'm going to shift to 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.510
 relive at the height of the ear 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.360
 I'm talking about doing more at half my 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:27.880
 wick 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.880
 I do not want the real thing like that 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.340

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.130

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.970
 short hair is not the thing the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.410
 longer scarf appearance 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.490

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.490

 before the look face these little ones 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.280
 groups is full axis but their marriage 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.609
 it gave me the impression of having said 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.609
 all 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.370
