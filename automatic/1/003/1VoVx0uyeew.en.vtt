00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.830 
person that would call for that yeah
because<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.730> actually<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.030> play<00:03:19.240> tennis<00:03:19.480> when<00:03:19.780> I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
because I actually I play tennis when I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.510 
because I actually I play tennis when I
was<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.200> high<00:03:20.320> school<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.860> mean<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.100> didn't<00:03:21.310> play

to<00:03:27.310> focus<00:03:27.520> more<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.000> ricotta<00:03:28.840> pitch<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.530> my

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
to focus more and ricotta pitch of my

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.980 
to focus more and ricotta pitch of my
seven<00:03:30.160> letters<00:03:30.460> just<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.820> out<00:03:31.000> there<00:03:31.240> all<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
seven letters just you out there all the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.540

mistakes<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.470> make<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:33.010> don't<00:03:33.190> have<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.400> make

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
mistakes you make you don't have to make

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.680
