00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 Jajaan this time buddy is t 57 self-propelled gun 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.500
 I will try to use self-propelled gun this time Self-propelled gun 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.940
 By the way, it is the second self-propelled gun in this battle 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 How affordable price by saying let's do the time being not know what should I t 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.020
 Choose 57 US Army Self-propelled Artillery 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.800
 You should strike it from behind 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.800
 Maybe 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:32.400
 I am anxious only while fighting start I will wait at the back while taking out the light tank for the time being 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.010
 1 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:50.920
 I thought so, but I 'm stuck in the back -how is it- flower picking 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.920
 Because there is no choice, self-propelled guns themselves on the front 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.090
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 I wonder if you can hit from here where the enemy has come out 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.250
 It was Barre whereabouts or I try to hit anyway even if I state that there is That's impossible obstacle 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.860
 me 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.120
 Hiding in the bush 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.120
 It's a self - propelled gun that looks for enemies 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.600
 Even so, it does not Well low-tier So Shota slow to match the standard 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.510
 Standard alignment body 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.069
 Oh gone 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.790
 Even though it was a one-kill 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.930
 I'm going to miss this time 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.800
 Departure 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.800
 It was a big lonely little left 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.960
 Launch immediately after the end of the day 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.709
 I was taken off 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.690
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 Predicted enemy's movement and departed significantly 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.280
 difficult 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:07.790
 If you think that a self-propelled gun is found approaching this is bad 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:12.430
 I oh well I'm unreasonable because self-propelled artillery slow absolutely as possible escape to escape 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.430
 For now, if you think you're going out 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.849
 It's what the map of Hajikko This is first Ui' 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:28.840
 That's right ぇ This fight has lost, so there is no result 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:31.139
 I was beaten by a fellow who tried to help me if I thought 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.139
 Zamaa 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.410
 Round 2 Self-propelled gun this time 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.490
 I am sorry that this map self-propelled gun is not turned 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:48.830
 But where to give up After the end of the game the enemy Ujauja 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.830
 If you let go of it properly, it will be someone 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:15.409
 Oro you are in full sight , it looks and looks like a self-propelled gun 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:19.629
 It feels like I hit it for the first time I was hit and I hit the attack of a self-propelled gun 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.629
 Next time you get a shot 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:31.190
 Gonna dangerous Oh found this premonition coming plunged toward the self-propelled artillery 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.190
 Well I knew it would be the case with this narrow map though 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.770
 By What should be noted is good if hits or leave the warning shot even a little 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:56.740
 It won't hit, Oh, a light tank approaches 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.740
 Earn some time 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:14.240
 The middle tank runs weak from behind, but maybe it is 1 to 7 or so. 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.240
 Sorry 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.240
 But it is impossible 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:43.650
 I have never bought it on me p Mainly I am not a self-propelled gun , but I proceed with research on Tiger 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:49.310
 More or later American military vehicles 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.310
 By the way, I said I'm going to slow down again next time
