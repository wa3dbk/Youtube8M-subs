 hello tankers with you expromt max and this 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.080
 largest update to 0 8 6 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.330
 and it is that now 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.310
 almost every tanker can 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.259
 choose assembly for yourself be you 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.599
 fan of hard minimalism 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.070
 or a lover of every kind of beauty 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.350
 and even with ted and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.540
 will be able to choose for themselves suitable 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.149
 assembly and so assemblies at the moment 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.800
 released h4 in functionality they are identical 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.809
 and but their appearance significantly 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.820
 different in this video we will cover 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.040
 the difference is each of them a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.020
 also changes from previous 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.790
 version well, a more detailed description 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.040
 represented as a to the previous one 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.970
 the fourth version of the assembly and so the first 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.190
 assembly death 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.840
 this is already familiar to you from previous versions 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.790
 builds but modified interface 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.310
 the hallmark of which are revealed 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.840
 star crosses over technique showing 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.030
 color player statistics 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.159
 also shields over allies marker 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.649
 priority target over the enemy when 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.409
 reaching a 25% strength threshold 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.840
 inscriptions in the destruction of an ally deer and 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.880
 the enemy in the hangar now we consider 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 visual differences of all assemblies about 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.020
 innovations at the end of the video 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.399
 here you can see the name of the version 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 your build 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.450
 which will disappear after the first penetration 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.850
 in battle, the heat look was rewritten 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.069
 and changed color to a more aesthetic gray 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.109
 only the total damage is highlighted in color and 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.749
 shard appearing after destruction 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.729
 you are the opponent in the damage panel color 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.889
 damage done to you and also changed 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.049
 the name of the tanks on the minimap 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:44.389
 now written in font for the overall style 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.399
 build again remind more detailed 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:48.529
 description of all values â€‹â€‹of indicators you 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.039
 can look at the previous guide 

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:54.469
 build version second build new grandfather it 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.289
 genealogical continuation of the assembly grandfather 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.179
 but with very important key changes 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.149
 honors new grandfather from the troubles is 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.579
 the lack of Christoph asterisks accounts and 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.740
 changed target priority token that 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.229
 frees mass space over 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.240
 player's stat tank is enclosed in here 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 such a compact light icon 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.490
 player statistics marker 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.890
 priority target appearing after 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.410
 as the enemy has less than 25 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.510
 percent strength the status of glare in 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.630
 enemy ears denote compact 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.030
 Font arrows ears reduced by 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.790
 the destruction of an ally appears the inscription 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.430
 deer at the destruction of the enemy in the hangar 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.920
 hit lacquer damage in panel damage one gray 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.620
 the color and font on the minimap are also all 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.290
 inscriptions are made in the general style of sight 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.840
 even more minimized transparent mesh 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 exhibited by ten percent at 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.060
 pressed alt extended statistics 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.980
 players and the remaining enemy hp 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.090
 identical in all assemblies third build 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.830
 elegant 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.380
 most inscriptions are made 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.770
 handwritten informative font assembly 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.090
 elegant and further considered standard 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.640
 politically correct and in them you will not meet 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.580
 inscriptions in hangar deer skulls and so 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.550
 further sign of destruction looks like this 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.040
 in the ears hit logies in battle destruction also 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.260
 indicated by heat look damage 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.150
 panel and sight all done in 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.110
 elegant style mini card 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.180
 softly echoes the font in the ears 4 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.760
 assembly standard for lovers 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.280
 minimalism and monotony also as 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.380
 Lyagan skull assemblies replaced by checkboxes 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.750
 all that can distract the players 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.970
 brought to a minimalist color in this 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.430
 assembly of the palest transparency 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.250
 indicators are minimal according to my forecasts 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.830
 build is needed is standard will be the most 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.450
 popular from this series respectively 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.300
 I will develop them further 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.520
 the fate of the gathering did elegant decide 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.750
 by itself there will be demand will and 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.450
 further development 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.140
 it is also possible the emergence of new assemblies in 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.900
 depending on your requests and now 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.360
 about innovations removed stemming 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.670
 in front of an obstacle in sight appeared 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.010
 countdown timer with the last time 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.560
 hitting your tank 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.990
 treating crew repair ammunition and so 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.300
 then performed while holding alt and 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.549
 press her left mouse button on 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.290
 damaged module or crew members 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.510
 also appeared soundtrack 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.300
 in case of fire and damage 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.680
 icons are correctly deployed in the hangar and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.140
 in training rooms 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.040
 a long-awaited focus marker appeared 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.030
 combat menu 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.580
 as well as a premium premium hangar for 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.860
 premium account and for basic and now 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.240

 which ejects to your desktop 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.360
 when installing the assembly but the best 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.430
 way and most importantly free for 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.440
 you download this assembly and all of it 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.720
 add-ons with letitbit but as it turned out 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.610
 for many it is huge 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
