00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 my heart is always new video goes today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.190
 Once upon a time from Stockholm 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.250
 google for the galaxy s 4g 1525 yourself 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.340
 here from jamal union and that around the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.020
 stable v2 that means they are very 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.020
 stable freedom as I said 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 So lockscreen around like that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.570
 Actually, we know it from the nexus 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:36.050
 know how it is delivered 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.739
 we actually only have one outer surface here 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.100
 it's fine but it 's still in the normal 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 so now not covered 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 and yes we have here or we are here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.039
 on the basis of 1505 g so of the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 google variant was posted here 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.570
 and once the version 4 point 4.4 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.969
 kitkat here you can see a little bug 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.129
 I can do that but what's the point here 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.229
 you can see four point 4.4 kitkat 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 in the app threatens to come around so 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.200
 to open this multitasking window 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.090
 have to double tap once 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 so that opens up here we go 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.979
 then in the setting actually 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.979
 nothing special 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.409
 yes as I said that is like the nexus and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.820
 sees is going very well you 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.820
 can really do a lot of things here 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:35.689
 have and other things the camera 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.590
 Of course, it works, too 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.729
 lightning or other things even 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.189
 to adjust 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.579
 in what quality does that or too 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:54.180
 for example here photos in 16 to 9 of 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 the front camera the rear camera can 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.390
 we also 16 to 9 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.329
 so that you saw that was a square 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.369
 Now we have a full screen mode here 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:10.720
 we turn the whole thing and yes it was 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.660
 to the camera 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:22.310
 of course google we also have like 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:24.530
 the weather today at that time so it 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.610
 Everything works fine as you 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.000
 it now also knows of the next or 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:35.380
 exempt from the google variant of the s4 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.250
 menu have turn off flight mode louder 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.960
 storm or otherwise vibrate otherwise 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.660
 pre-installed apps for no other play 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:53.090
 games in so what is that for once 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.050
 400 megabytes big yes here again the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.870
 so nothing special actually 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.900
 without futures just the pure asp 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.320
 without other things onassis so it is 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.840
 stop and yes as I said there is 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.180
 not so much to say she runs 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.740
 very good so you can not 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.520
 complain 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.410
 and yes, I would come again 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.700
 say goodbye live until next time 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.780
 commented subscribes that we are 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.790
 a thumbs up 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.090
 if you liked it left there 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.860
 of course in the description in it 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.860
 and yes until next time
