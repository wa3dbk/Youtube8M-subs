well over a mile of vertical drop it
would<00:02:25.239> take<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> long<00:02:25.810> time<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.620> ski<00:02:26.860> down

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
would take a long time just to ski down

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.220 
would take a long time just to ski down
to<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> bottom<00:02:27.519> but<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.570> course<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.900> snow

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
to the bottom but of course the snow

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.970 
to the bottom but of course the snow
doesn't<00:02:29.440> extend<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.070> far<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.410> lower<00:02:32.650> part

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
doesn't extend that far the lower part

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.229 
doesn't extend that far the lower part
of<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.100> mountain<00:02:33.190> doesn't<00:02:33.489> have<00:02:33.640> any<00:02:33.790> snow<00:02:34.090> at

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
of the mountain doesn't have any snow at

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.130 
of the mountain doesn't have any snow at
all<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:35.170> fact<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.739> ski<00:02:36.070> down<00:02:36.310> from<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.730> top

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
all in fact as you ski down from the top

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.960 
all in fact as you ski down from the top
the<00:02:38.140> snow<00:02:38.380> gets<00:02:38.590> softer<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.250> softer<00:02:39.489> because

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the snow gets softer and softer because

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.490 
the snow gets softer and softer because
the<00:02:40.209> temperature<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.750> getting<00:02:41.019> warmer<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the temperature is getting warmer and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.040 
the temperature is getting warmer and
warmer<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:43.570> makes<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> snow<00:02:44.550> more<00:02:45.550> wet

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
warmer and that makes the snow more wet

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.020 
warmer and that makes the snow more wet
more<00:02:47.050> slow<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.920> little<00:02:48.250> more<00:02:48.400> dangerous<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
more slow a little more dangerous I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.509 
more slow a little more dangerous I
suppose<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> very<00:02:50.800> top<00:02:51.010> it's

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
suppose but up at the very top it's

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.720 
suppose but up at the very top it's
really<00:02:52.090> good<00:02:52.810> skiing<00:02:53.200> up<00:02:53.530> at<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.280> upper

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
really good skiing up at the upper

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
really good skiing up at the upper
elevations<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.810> mountain<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
elevations on the mountain all of the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.140 
elevations on the mountain all of the
area<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.470> carved<00:03:00.130> out<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.580> shaped<00:03:00.970> by

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
area was carved out and shaped by

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.630 
area was carved out and shaped by
glaciers<00:03:01.870> throw<00:03:02.680> glaciers<00:03:03.100> up<00:03:03.280> there<00:03:03.459> that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
glaciers throw glaciers up there that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.610 
glaciers throw glaciers up there that
dug<00:03:04.150> away<00:03:04.330> at<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.660> mountains<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.170> created

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
dug away at the mountains and created

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.789 
dug away at the mountains and created
the<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.459> terrain<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.320> e

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the the terrain that you see and the e

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.920 
the the terrain that you see and the e
ski<00:03:09.220> over<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.700> really<00:03:09.910> defines<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.269> skiing

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
ski over that really defines the skiing

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.790 
ski over that really defines the skiing
it<00:03:11.530> makes<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.860> some<00:03:12.040> really<00:03:12.280> good<00:03:12.430> terrain
