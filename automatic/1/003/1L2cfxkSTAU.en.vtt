all<00:00:37.300> around<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.750> world<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.649> do<00:00:38.920> different

accents<00:00:40.210> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:42.010> there<00:00:42.190> is<00:00:42.339> something

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
accents I think that there is something

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.079 
accents I think that there is something
in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:45.190> idea<00:00:45.820> of<00:00:46.149> children<00:00:46.600> really<00:00:47.230> working

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
in the idea of children really working

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.060 
in the idea of children really working
extremely<00:00:49.089> hard<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.929> master<00:00:50.409> something<00:00:50.679> that

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
extremely hard to master something that

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.259 
extremely hard to master something that
is<00:00:51.219> very<00:00:51.429> hard<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.780> work<00:00:53.050> toward<00:00:53.559> a<00:00:53.649> physical

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
is very hard to work toward a physical

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.840 
is very hard to work toward a physical
goal<00:00:55.269> is<00:00:56.050> really<00:00:56.469> important<00:00:57.010> for<00:00:57.370> all<00:00:57.429> of<00:00:57.730> us

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
goal is really important for all of us

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.450 
goal is really important for all of us
but<00:00:58.420> for<00:00:58.629> this<00:00:58.780> age<00:00:59.050> it's<00:00:59.350> really<00:00:59.469> really

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
but for this age it's really really

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.079 
but for this age it's really really
central<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:00.999> their<00:01:01.269> development<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:03.460> first

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
central to their development my first

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.500

have skills that we teach at the

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.600 
have skills that we teach at the
beginning<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.230> are<00:01:29.770> fairly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
beginning that are fairly

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.730 
beginning that are fairly
straightforward<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.570> fairly<00:01:31.660> easy<00:01:32.290> they

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
straightforward and fairly easy they

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.620 
straightforward and fairly easy they
start<00:01:33.040> with<00:01:33.130> one<00:01:33.340> ball<00:01:33.610> when<00:01:33.850> they<00:01:33.970> juggle<00:01:34.180> and

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
start with one ball when they juggle and

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.040 
start with one ball when they juggle and
now<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.650> lot<00:01:36.010> of<00:01:36.160> them<00:01:36.280> are<00:01:36.400> juggling<00:01:36.610> three<00:01:37.060> so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
now a lot of them are juggling three so

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.980 
now a lot of them are juggling three so
it's<00:01:38.230> a<00:01:38.320> process<00:01:38.940> when<00:01:39.940> they<00:01:40.120> walk<00:01:40.360> across<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
it's a process when they walk across the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's a process when they walk across the
tightrope<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.370> beginning<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.940> year

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
tightrope at the beginning of the year

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.450 
tightrope at the beginning of the year
a<00:01:43.420> lot<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.810> them<00:01:43.990> need<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.200> hand<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:45.040> give<00:01:45.220> them<00:01:45.370> a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
a lot of them need a hand we give them a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.490 
a lot of them need a hand we give them a
hand<00:01:45.700> they<00:01:45.880> walk<00:01:46.110> eventually<00:01:47.110> they'll<00:01:47.260> take<00:01:47.470> a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
hand they walk eventually they'll take a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.910 
hand they walk eventually they'll take a
step<00:01:47.770> or<00:01:47.890> two<00:01:47.950> now<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:49.270> lot<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.290> kids<00:01:50.470> just<00:01:50.680> walk

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
step or two now a lot of kids just walk

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.460 
step or two now a lot of kids just walk
or<00:01:51.190> they<00:01:51.400> walk<00:01:51.610> backwards<00:01:52.120> or<00:01:52.720> they<00:01:53.230> walk

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
or they walk backwards or they walk

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.670 
or they walk backwards or they walk
together<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.160> then<00:01:54.280> go<00:01:54.430> backwards<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.900> it's<00:01:56.530> a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
together and then go backwards so it's a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.500 
together and then go backwards so it's a
process<00:01:56.920> throughout<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.760> year<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
process throughout the year to get to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.770 
process throughout the year to get to
where<00:01:58.810> they're<00:01:58.930> at<00:01:59.110> now

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
where they're at now

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.850 
where they're at now
I<00:02:01.520> was<00:02:02.520> sort<00:02:02.760> of<00:02:02.850> inspired<00:02:03.510> by<00:02:03.930> last<00:02:04.320> year's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
I was sort of inspired by last year's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.059 
I was sort of inspired by last year's
like<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.940> wire-walking<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:07.409> pretty<00:02:07.770> tough

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
like the wire-walking it's pretty tough

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.010 
like the wire-walking it's pretty tough
going<00:02:08.280> backwards<00:02:09.240> because<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.630> can't<00:02:09.869> really

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
going backwards because you can't really

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.600 
going backwards because you can't really
see<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.590> you're<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
see where you're going you have to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
see where you're going you have to
mostly<00:02:12.060> keep<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.480> balance<00:02:12.660> while<00:02:12.959> feeling

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
mostly keep your balance while feeling

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.820 
mostly keep your balance while feeling
with<00:02:13.530> your<00:02:13.709> feet<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.120> mostly

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
with your feet so it's like mostly

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.550 
with your feet so it's like mostly
multitasking<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:18.540> walking<00:02:18.840> backwards<00:02:19.440> is

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
multitasking so if walking backwards is

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.229 
multitasking so if walking backwards is
hard<00:02:19.890> then<00:02:20.069> walking<00:02:20.400> backwards<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.030> wire

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
hard then walking backwards on the wire

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.020 
hard then walking backwards on the wire
is<00:02:21.569> even<00:02:21.840> harder<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:25.640> think<00:02:26.640> most<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> kids

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
is even harder I think most of the kids

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.660 
is even harder I think most of the kids
lace<00:02:27.989> they<00:02:28.500> sort<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.800> see<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> circus<00:02:29.430> every

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
lace they sort of see the circus every

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.860 
lace they sort of see the circus every
year<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:30.630> look<00:02:30.750> with

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
year and so if they look with

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.960 
year and so if they look with
anticipation<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.860> someday<00:02:32.610> they're<00:02:32.850> gonna

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
anticipation that someday they're gonna

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.630 
anticipation that someday they're gonna
be<00:02:33.180> doing<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> circus<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.340> he's<00:02:35.340> been<00:02:35.519> waiting
