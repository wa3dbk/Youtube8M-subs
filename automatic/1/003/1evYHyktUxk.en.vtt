00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.120
 the people of youtube here talk to them alex 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.000
 um and today I come with the tutorial for 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.860
 make those games run faster 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.840
 with 1 so much but a little faster is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.870
 a very easy thing they just have to 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.620
 have the game's shortcut in its 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.420
 desktop or by default and be the 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.420
 equipment folder 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.039
 local disk I know 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.250
 and they look for the game they want to accelerate and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.019
 they will not be accelerated much but they 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.350
 will serve me it served me immensely 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.050
 advice and the software have to look 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.100
 the files show them in an example 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 how he wanted to play 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.980
 in this case it looks in the executable of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.160
 his game 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.160
 what is next for example in this 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:25.180
 they go to my nose jokes this look for the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.049
 execute me pick me up they give him an insect 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.719
 mario properties 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.609
 incompatibility run these three in 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.040
 windows xp in this case would be 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.230
 our 2 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.820
 but in all the others would be these 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.820
 three in sight and 7 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.159
 they do not take them off 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.570
 I'm going to apply then good the removes that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.570
 they put them apply 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.930
 apply and accept and thus enable them 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.390
 many functions that will help them 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.000
 run for less fast 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.640
 once they have it technically what 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.640
 execute and will happen the following 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.200
 all 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.390
 where 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.970
 he will ask for right two ministers except 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.970
 in xp wansink and come what's going to happen 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.100
 many visual themes are reduced and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.420
 tachÃ¡n is going to change them a lot 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.420
 but only for this moment 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.170
 and in the world the original theme the same 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.170
 guangzhou 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.640
 with any only executable 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.480
 they will apply 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 good is going to celebrate the games 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.590
 they no longer go to and it's so slow 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.140
 he serves us in resident evil 5 do not know 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.710
 recommends them because if they do not have 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.830
 the necessary resources 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.530
 we must continue working 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.770
 and not only for those who have to be 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.500
 encourages 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.520
 but if it's going to speed us up a lot 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.640
 Well that was all please comment 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.230
 is thankful I have served them 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.230
 lesson to another
