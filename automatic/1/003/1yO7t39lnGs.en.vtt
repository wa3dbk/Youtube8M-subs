videos<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.630> about<00:00:33.950> I'm<00:00:34.950> figuring<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
videos more about I'm figuring this is a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.840 
videos more about I'm figuring this is a
stand<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.329> work<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> directions<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.610> pretty

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
stand to work the directions are pretty

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.500 
stand to work the directions are pretty
good<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.770> already<00:00:40.950> there's<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> once<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
good but I already there's this once I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this the way you can plug is starting to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.560 
this the way you can plug is starting to
show<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:26.880> pieces<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.450> this

lightning cable down in this little

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.440 
lightning cable down in this little
cradle<00:01:40.310> keeps<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.579> moving<00:01:41.909> too<00:01:42.030> far<00:01:42.210> it's

cradle keeps for moving too far it's
nice<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.840> snug<00:01:45.500> next<00:01:48.200> push<00:01:49.200> up

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
nice and snug next push up

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.970 
nice and snug next push up
so<00:01:51.670> we<00:01:51.790> come<00:01:51.970> out<00:01:52.090> at<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.270> top<00:01:52.590> yeah<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:53.890> we

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
so we come out at the top yeah now we

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.190 
so we come out at the top yeah now we
got<00:01:54.010> an<00:01:54.220> assembly<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:55.720> do<00:01:55.780> we<00:01:55.870> do<00:01:55.990> with<00:01:56.080> that

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
got an assembly what do we do with that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200 
got an assembly what do we do with that
assembly<00:01:57.120> it's<00:01:58.120> not<00:01:58.300> hard<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:59.910> take<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.060> next

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
assembly it's not hard to take the next

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.970 
assembly it's not hard to take the next
step<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.050> key<00:02:02.230> is<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.470> hold<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.860> place

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
step just the key is to hold it in place

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.250 
step just the key is to hold it in place
while<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.430> do<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.970> probably<00:02:04.720> easiest<00:02:05.050> to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
while you do it so probably easiest to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.460 
while you do it so probably easiest to
bend<00:02:05.650> this<00:02:05.830> sideways<00:02:06.479> I'll<00:02:07.479> have<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.780> look<00:02:07.960> now

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
bend this sideways I'll have a look now

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.560 
bend this sideways I'll have a look now
you're<00:02:08.710> starting<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.070> get<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> picture<00:02:09.570> down

you're starting to get the picture down
tryna<00:02:12.060> fit<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:14.910> right<00:02:15.910> here<00:02:16.420> there's<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
tryna fit this in right here there's a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.560 
tryna fit this in right here there's a

and when I try our iPhone 5 let's see
our<00:03:31.989> works<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:35.260> drop<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:36.180> click<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:38.290> is

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
our works just drop it on click and is

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.360 
our works just drop it on click and is
obviously<00:03:38.830> charging<00:03:39.480> quite<00:03:40.480> easy<00:03:41.100> now<00:03:42.100> let's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
obviously charging quite easy now let's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.170 
obviously charging quite easy now let's
take<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.700> next<00:03:42.880> step<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:45.340> has<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.610> rubber<00:03:46.000> on

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
take the next step it has a rubber on

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.270 
take the next step it has a rubber on
the<00:03:46.299> back<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:47.170> sliding<00:03:47.590> rails<00:03:47.739> not<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> problem

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the back so sliding rails not a problem

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.530 
the back so sliding rails not a problem
but<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> whole<00:03:48.610> state<00:03:48.940> will<00:03:49.090> pick<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.360> at<00:03:49.450> the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
but the whole state will pick up at the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.880 
but the whole state will pick up at the
phone<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.079> kind<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.410> two<00:03:50.590> handed

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890

phone so it is kind of a two handed
operation<00:03:51.130> I'm<00:03:52.060> probably<00:03:52.360> going<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.720> use<00:03:52.840> some

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
operation I'm probably going to use some

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.229 
operation I'm probably going to use some
sticky<00:03:53.440> stuff<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.920> put<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.100> down<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.880> that

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
if this will work nicely even with a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.640 
if this will work nicely even with a
bumper<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.340> place<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.870> let's<00:04:12.020> get<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.290> bumper

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
bumper in place so let's get the bumper

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:21.009 
bumper in place so let's get the bumper
going<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.500> it's<00:04:16.310> like<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.579> case<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.750> used<00:04:20.900> a

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
going so it's like the case you used a

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.659 
going so it's like the case you used a
bunch<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.320> these<00:04:21.500> they've<00:04:22.040> lasted<00:04:22.250> anywhere

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
bunch of these they've lasted anywhere

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.760 
bunch of these they've lasted anywhere
from<00:04:22.820> eight<00:04:23.000> months<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.389> a<00:04:23.450> year<00:04:23.510> almost<00:04:24.500> two

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
here on the iphone 5 and let's go ahead

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.690 
here on the iphone 5 and let's go ahead
and<00:04:27.919> line<00:04:28.070> up<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.220> buttons<00:04:28.580> first<00:04:30.520> it's<00:04:31.520> got<00:04:31.580> a

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
and line up the buttons first it's got a

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.690 
and line up the buttons first it's got a
solid<00:04:31.970> feel<00:04:33.010> we're<00:04:34.010> in<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.130> edges<00:04:34.370> fairly

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
solid feel we're in the edges fairly

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.740 
solid feel we're in the edges fairly
well<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:37.010> very<00:04:37.340> slight<00:04:37.760> raised<00:04:38.060> edge<00:04:38.360> here

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
well it's a very slight raised edge here

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.230 
well it's a very slight raised edge here
but<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.710> rubber<00:04:39.979> itself<00:04:40.400> doesn't<00:04:40.700> get<00:04:41.000> all

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
but the rubber itself doesn't get all

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.940 
but the rubber itself doesn't get all
fuzzy<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.810> your<00:04:41.930> pocket<00:04:42.320> which<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.620> like<00:04:42.770> it's

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
fuzzy in your pocket which I like it's

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.040 
fuzzy in your pocket which I like it's
kind<00:04:43.100> of<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.220> hard<00:04:43.400> rubber<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:45.910> photobomb<00:04:47.050> okay

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
kind of a hard rubber and photobomb okay

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.960 
kind of a hard rubber and photobomb okay
so<00:04:48.380> we<00:04:48.620> got<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.860> bumper<00:04:49.130> in<00:04:49.220> place<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.790> key

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
so we got the bumper in place the key

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.390 
so we got the bumper in place the key
question<00:04:50.389> is<00:04:50.570> with<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.710> design<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.220> cut
