that<00:05:49.800> right<00:05:49.979> path<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.430> mean<00:05:50.550> hey<00:05:50.700> maybe<00:05:50.880> I'm

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
that right path I mean hey maybe I'm

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.400 
that right path I mean hey maybe I'm
biased<00:05:51.210> because<00:05:51.540> I<00:05:51.720> got<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.050> know<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.200> little

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
biased because I got to know a little

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.050 
biased because I got to know a little
bit<00:05:52.620> when<00:05:52.830> he<00:05:52.919> was<00:05:53.040> competing<00:05:53.310> here<00:05:53.550> in<00:05:53.669> Jersey

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
bit when he was competing here in Jersey

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.540 
bit when he was competing here in Jersey
I<00:05:54.440> think<00:05:55.440> he'll<00:05:55.590> be<00:05:55.710> all<00:05:55.830> right<00:05:55.860> down<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.340> road

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
I think he'll be all right down the road

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.950 
I think he'll be all right down the road
but<00:05:56.880> I'm<00:05:57.240> sure<00:05:57.419> it's<00:05:57.540> gonna<00:05:57.600> be<00:05:57.750> awhile<00:05:57.840> before

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
but I'm sure it's gonna be awhile before

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.380
