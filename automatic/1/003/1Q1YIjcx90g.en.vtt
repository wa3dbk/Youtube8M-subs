and see how much damage at this okay so
that<00:02:08.700> did<00:02:08.879> three<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.569> half<00:02:09.599> hearts<00:02:10.319> of

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that did three and a half hearts of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.880 
that did three and a half hearts of
damage<00:02:10.830> which<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:12.150> his<00:02:12.360> fist

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
damage which that's just his fist

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.010 
damage which that's just his fist
so<00:02:13.340> assuming<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.270> make<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> good<00:02:14.720> stone

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
so assuming you can make a good stone

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.010 
so assuming you can make a good stone
sword<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.740> mean<00:02:15.920> that's<00:02:16.069> pretty<00:02:16.400> much<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:17.020> calum

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
sword I mean that's pretty much I calum

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.120 
sword I mean that's pretty much I calum
one<00:02:18.230> or<00:02:18.380> two<00:02:18.530> hits<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.970> ultimately<00:02:21.130> especially

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
one or two hits so ultimately especially

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.440 
one or two hits so ultimately especially
if<00:02:22.220> you're<00:02:22.310> going<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.520> make<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.760> base<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.270> water

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
if you're going to make a base in water

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.690 
if you're going to make a base in water
or<00:02:23.780> really<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.040> carry<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.400> water

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
or really you can just carry a water

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.990 
or really you can just carry a water
bucket<00:02:25.970> around<00:02:26.240> with<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.290> then<00:02:28.160> what's

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
bucket around with you and then what's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.650 
bucket around with you and then what's
that<00:02:29.060> noise<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:31.870> okay<00:02:33.280> anyway<00:02:34.660> ultimately

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
that noise that's okay anyway ultimately

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.600 
that noise that's okay anyway ultimately
you<00:02:35.990> can<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.320> carry<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.860> water<00:02:37.100> bucket<00:02:37.370> around

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
you can just carry a water bucket around

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.949 
you can just carry a water bucket around
with<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.090> find<00:02:38.390> some<00:02:38.600> iron<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:40.810> you'll<00:02:41.810> be
