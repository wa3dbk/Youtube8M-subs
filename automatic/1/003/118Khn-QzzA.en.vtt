00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
I'll be back with the other method in a

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.580 
I'll be back with the other method in a
second<00:05:07.660> okay<00:05:08.660> I'm<00:05:08.900> back<00:05:09.140> with<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.380> other

second okay I'm back with the other

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.560 
second okay I'm back with the other
method<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:10.100> you're<00:05:10.910> going<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.060> start<00:05:11.390> off

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
method and you're going to start off

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.380 
method and you're going to start off
exactly<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.530> same<00:05:12.710> as<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:13.010> first<00:05:13.190> method<00:05:13.669> but

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
exactly the same as the first method but

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.270 
exactly the same as the first method but
when<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.780> strafe<00:05:15.200> behind<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.620> pole<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:16.010> avoid

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
when you strafe behind the pole to avoid

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.800 
when you strafe behind the pole to avoid
as<00:05:16.430> Nova<00:05:16.789> you're<00:05:16.940> going<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.180> want<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.450> put<00:05:17.690> on

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
as Nova you're going to want to put on

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.920 
as Nova you're going to want to put on
the<00:05:17.930> shames<00:05:18.229> you<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.910> also<00:05:19.910> pull<00:05:20.539> out<00:05:20.660> your

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
the shames you and also pull out your

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.830 
the shames you and also pull out your
corrosive<00:05:21.500> northie<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:26.389> you're<00:05:26.630> going<00:05:26.780> to

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
corrosive northie so you're going to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.409 
corrosive northie so you're going to
start<00:05:27.139> throwing<00:05:27.910> singularity<00:05:28.910> grenades<00:05:29.240> to

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
start throwing singularity grenades to

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.909 
start throwing singularity grenades to
get<00:05:29.539> all<00:05:29.720> of<00:05:29.870> his<00:05:29.900> minions<00:05:30.380> gathered<00:05:30.770> up

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
get all of his minions gathered up

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.219 
get all of his minions gathered up
together<00:05:31.100> and<00:05:31.700> then<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.240> find<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:32.780> takes<00:05:33.050> about

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
together and then I find it takes about

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.890 
together and then I find it takes about
two<00:05:33.740> shocks<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.400> take<00:05:34.580> them<00:05:34.760> all<00:05:35.180> out<00:05:35.240> with<00:05:35.720> it

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
two shocks to take them all out with it

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.890 
two shocks to take them all out with it
and<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.820> reason<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.240> want<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.510> put<00:05:38.690> on<00:05:38.780> the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
and the reason you want to put on the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.719 
and the reason you want to put on the
sham<00:05:39.110> is<00:05:39.289> you<00:05:39.440> might<00:05:39.710> not<00:05:39.919> even<00:05:40.100> need<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.520> same

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
sham is you might not even need the same

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.360 
sham is you might not even need the same
but<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:42.080> helps<00:05:42.440> just<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.740> make<00:05:42.919> sure<00:05:43.070> that<00:05:43.220> you

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
but it helps just to make sure that you

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.670 
but it helps just to make sure that you
absorbed<00:05:43.820> that<00:05:44.000> ammo<00:05:44.360> just<00:05:44.570> make<00:05:45.380> sure<00:05:45.530> you

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
absorbed that ammo just make sure you

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.180 
absorbed that ammo just make sure you
have<00:05:45.770> enough<00:05:46.130> for<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:47.030> last<00:05:47.240> perfectly

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
have enough for the last perfectly

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.860 
have enough for the last perfectly
so<00:05:48.700> after<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:48.970> take<00:05:49.120> down<00:05:49.330> all<00:05:49.600> of<00:05:49.630> his

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
so after you take down all of his

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.380 
so after you take down all of his
minions<00:05:50.640> you're<00:05:51.640> going<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.820> want<00:05:51.970> to<00:05:52.030> switch

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
minions you're going to want to switch

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.300 
minions you're going to want to switch
back<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.990> B<00:05:53.170> and<00:05:53.410> you're<00:05:53.950> going<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.160> want

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
back to the B and you're going to want

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.920 
back to the B and you're going to want
to<00:05:54.400> try<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.610> do<00:05:54.760> as<00:05:54.910> much<00:05:55.150> damage<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.690> them

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
to try and do as much damage to them

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.290 
to try and do as much damage to them
with<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.320> sand<00:05:57.160> hawk<00:05:57.400> as<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.700> possibly<00:05:58.090> can

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
with the sand hawk as you possibly can

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.000 
with the sand hawk as you possibly can
also<00:05:58.510> throw<00:05:58.930> your<00:05:59.170> turret<00:05:59.470> because<00:05:59.620> it<00:05:59.830> will

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
also throw your turret because it will

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.450 
also throw your turret because it will
increase<00:06:00.160> your<00:06:00.400> fire<00:06:00.820> rate<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.060> your<00:06:01.450> damage

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
increase your fire rate and your damage

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.930 
increase your fire rate and your damage
and<00:06:04.320> if<00:06:05.320> you<00:06:05.500> do<00:06:05.650> it<00:06:05.800> perfectly<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.640> can<00:06:06.700> get

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
and if you do it perfectly you can get

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.400 
and if you do it perfectly you can get
them<00:06:07.030> to<00:06:07.120> jump<00:06:07.390> at<00:06:07.600> you<00:06:07.630> right<00:06:07.960> away<00:06:08.050> but<00:06:08.170> of

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
them to jump at you right away but of

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.080 
them to jump at you right away but of
course<00:06:08.590> I'm<00:06:08.770> using<00:06:08.980> a<00:06:09.160> fine<00:06:09.400> sand<00:06:09.700> hog<00:06:09.880> which

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
course I'm using a fine sand hog which

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.700 
course I'm using a fine sand hog which
is<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.300> best<00:06:10.510> one<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:10.750> you<00:06:11.080> might<00:06:11.410> have<00:06:11.530> to

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
is the best one so you might have to

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.740 
is the best one so you might have to
repeat<00:06:12.040> this<00:06:12.190> process<00:06:12.280> a<00:06:12.670> couple<00:06:13.000> times<00:06:13.210> when

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
repeat this process a couple times when

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.020 
repeat this process a couple times when
he<00:06:13.840> jumps<00:06:14.140> at<00:06:14.260> you<00:06:14.290> put<00:06:14.890> the<00:06:15.010> sham<00:06:15.250> back<00:06:15.520> on<00:06:15.790> and

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
he jumps at you put the sham back on and

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.600 
he jumps at you put the sham back on and
also<00:06:16.480> put<00:06:17.470> on<00:06:17.590> your<00:06:17.830> slide<00:06:18.100> grenade<00:06:18.430> now<00:06:18.580> I

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
also put on your slide grenade now I

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.430 
also put on your slide grenade now I
wasn't<00:06:18.910> even<00:06:19.270> using<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.720> right<00:06:19.900> sort<00:06:20.380> of

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
wasn't even using the right sort of

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.680 
wasn't even using the right sort of
slide<00:06:20.710> grenade<00:06:21.070> but<00:06:21.730> I<00:06:21.760> still<00:06:22.060> managed<00:06:22.390> to<00:06:22.420> get

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
slide grenade but I still managed to get

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.740 
slide grenade but I still managed to get
the<00:06:22.810> job<00:06:23.050> done<00:06:23.230> it<00:06:24.160> ends<00:06:24.460> exactly<00:06:24.640> the<00:06:25.360> same<00:06:25.570> as

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
the job done it ends exactly the same as

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.960 
the job done it ends exactly the same as
the<00:06:25.870> first<00:06:26.080> method<00:06:26.530> just<00:06:26.800> reload<00:06:27.340> cancel<00:06:27.820> by

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
the first method just reload cancel by

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.290 
the first method just reload cancel by
throwing<00:06:28.240> your<00:06:28.450> slide<00:06:28.720> grenades<00:06:29.140> and<00:06:30.300> you

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
throwing your slide grenades and you

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.760 
throwing your slide grenades and you
should<00:06:31.540> be<00:06:31.690> able<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:31.990> get<00:06:32.170> them<00:06:32.260> down<00:06:32.440> and

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
should be able to get them down and

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.430
