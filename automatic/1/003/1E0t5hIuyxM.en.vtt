00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
they're actually really tightly packed

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
they're actually really tightly packed
together<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> there's<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.900> bend

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200

too so here we have songs with all the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.270 
too so here we have songs with all the
lyrics

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:04.890 

then<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.150> record<00:01:59.850> there's<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.940> personal<00:02:03.600> okay

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
then the record there's a personal okay

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.160 
then the record there's a personal okay
and<00:02:05.080> then<00:02:05.229> next<00:02:05.410> up<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.100> course<00:02:06.340> have

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and then next up we of course have

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.370 
and then next up we of course have
imagined<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.820> front<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.590> back

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
imagined it's the front and the back

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.350 
imagined it's the front and the back
this<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.440> uh<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:15.280> mean<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.880> guess<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.209> wasn't

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
this is uh I mean I guess this wasn't

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
this is uh I mean I guess this wasn't
always<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.110> actually<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
always like this but it's actually a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.760 
always like this but it's actually a
really<00:02:17.650> thick<00:02:17.950> its<00:02:18.280> know<00:02:18.760> if<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:19.030> see

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
really thick its know if you can see

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.710 
really thick its know if you can see
it's<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:20.950> one<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.190> those<00:02:21.250> thick<00:02:21.490> types<00:02:21.760> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
it's like one of those thick types and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.820 
it's like one of those thick types and
but<00:02:22.990> anyway<00:02:23.320> so<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.560> guess<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.830> sleep

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
but anyway so I guess here is the sleep

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.720 
but anyway so I guess here is the sleep
at<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.130> album<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:29.160> I'm<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.340> gonna<00:02:30.520> take
