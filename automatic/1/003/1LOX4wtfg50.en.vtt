good<00:05:13.370> except<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.479> fact<00:05:14.690> that<00:05:15.020> my<00:05:15.830> eyes<00:05:15.979> are

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
good except to the fact that my eyes are

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.100 
good except to the fact that my eyes are
kind<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.520> tired<00:05:16.789> and<00:05:17.210> since<00:05:17.659> we<00:05:17.780> didn't<00:05:18.020> do

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
eyeshadow on them that's really a big

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.189 
eyeshadow on them that's really a big
part<00:05:19.819> if<00:05:20.120> you're<00:05:20.210> doing<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:20.539> a<00:05:20.599> fun<00:05:20.870> look<00:05:21.050> you
