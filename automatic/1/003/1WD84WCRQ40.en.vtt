00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
board you shot and it actually panned

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.190 
board you shot and it actually panned
out<00:01:09.820> well<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.180> helped<00:01:10.600> me<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.780> get<00:01:10.900> number<00:01:11.170> one

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
out well it helped me to get number one

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.630 
out well it helped me to get number one
so<00:01:11.560> I<00:01:11.590> thought<00:01:11.829> I'd<00:01:12.009> go<00:01:12.130> ahead<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.460> show<00:01:12.549> it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
so I thought I'd go ahead and show it

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.550 
so I thought I'd go ahead and show it
maybe<00:01:12.790> some<00:01:13.000> people<00:01:13.150> can<00:01:13.479> bring<00:01:14.140> out<00:01:14.290> some

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
maybe some people can bring out some

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.460 
maybe some people can bring out some
more<00:01:14.950> ideas<00:01:15.130> here<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.720> downside<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.439> using

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
more ideas here the downside to using

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.499 
more ideas here the downside to using
the<00:01:17.710> coin<00:01:17.890> fortunes<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.520> lose<00:01:18.700> convoys<00:01:19.329> in<00:01:19.360> a

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
the coin fortunes you lose convoys in a

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.320 
the coin fortunes you lose convoys in a
couple<00:01:19.810> ways<00:01:19.930> one<00:01:20.799> I'm<00:01:21.159> losing<00:01:21.610> combos<00:01:22.030> right

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
couple ways one I'm losing combos right

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.240 
couple ways one I'm losing combos right
now<00:01:22.540> because<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.260> coins<00:01:23.500> which<00:01:23.740> doesn't<00:01:24.220> give

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
now because the coins which doesn't give

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.850 
now because the coins which doesn't give
you<00:01:24.520> any<00:01:24.580> problems<00:01:24.970> whatsoever<00:01:25.360> if<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.500> unit

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
you any problems whatsoever if a unit

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.950 
you any problems whatsoever if a unit
dies<00:01:27.040> on<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.280> corn<00:01:27.580> forge<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:28.120> does<00:01:28.450> not<00:01:28.690> give

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
dies on the corn forge it does not give

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.620 
dies on the corn forge it does not give
you<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.530> combo<00:01:30.310> from<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.790> all<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> testing

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
you a combo from that all the testing

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.930 
you a combo from that all the testing
that<00:01:31.750> I've<00:01:31.900> done<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:33.130> that's<00:01:33.490> kind<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.850> a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
that I've done so that's kind of a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.880 
that I've done so that's kind of a
bummer<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.420> then<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.659> second<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.620> when

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
bummer and then the second is is when

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.039 
bummer and then the second is is when
it's<00:01:36.040> time<00:01:36.370> to<00:01:36.640> sell<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.360> coin<00:01:37.570> Forge<00:01:37.840> which

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
it's time to sell the coin Forge which

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's time to sell the coin Forge which
in<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.350> case<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.740> did<00:01:38.920> after<00:01:39.100> wave<00:01:39.490> 3<00:01:39.909> from

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
in this case I did after wave 3 from

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.149 
in this case I did after wave 3 from
beginning<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.540> way<00:01:40.690> for<00:01:40.990> sell<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.920> point

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
beginning of way for sell the point

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:42.870 
beginning of way for sell the point
forward

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
forward

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.480 
forward
and<00:01:43.479> then<00:01:43.810> throw<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.530> tar<00:01:44.710> caps<00:01:45.009> back<00:01:45.219> in

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and then throw the tar caps back in

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.630 
and then throw the tar caps back in
there<00:01:45.759> then<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.960> still<00:01:47.259> lose<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.250> combo

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
there then you still lose the the combo

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.270 
there then you still lose the the combo
slot<00:01:48.969> so<00:01:49.719> there's<00:01:50.259> definitely<00:01:50.530> negatives<00:01:51.189> on

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
slot so there's definitely negatives on

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.010 
slot so there's definitely negatives on
come<00:01:51.460> play<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.729> positives<00:01:52.299> though<00:01:52.479> is<00:01:52.750> I

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
come play the positives though is I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.730 
come play the positives though is I
start<00:01:53.920> wave<00:01:54.189> 4<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.299> my<00:01:55.539> watch<00:01:56.289> archers

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
start wave 4 and of my watch archers

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.419 
start wave 4 and of my watch archers
burning<00:01:57.130> pitch<00:01:57.369> grinders<00:01:58.360> mace<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.950> there's

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
burning pitch grinders mace so there's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.520 
burning pitch grinders mace so there's
definitely<00:02:00.670> some<00:02:01.030> pasta<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.450> lot<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.110> positive

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
definitely some pasta a lot of positive

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.870 
definitely some pasta a lot of positive
there<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.069> very<00:02:03.220> situational

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
there so this is a very situational

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.880 
there so this is a very situational
thing<00:02:03.939> at<00:02:04.210> least<00:02:04.270> from<00:02:04.569> when<00:02:05.350> I've<00:02:05.560> tried<00:02:05.799> to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
thing at least from when I've tried to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.669 
thing at least from when I've tried to
use<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:07.689> maybe<00:02:07.899> other<00:02:08.110> people<00:02:08.170> can

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
use it and but maybe other people can

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.259 
use it and but maybe other people can

you are comboing a lot to make up the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.420 
you are comboing a lot to make up the
lower<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.140> lack<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.590> combo<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.010> early<00:02:45.310> on

lower the lack of the combo is early on

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.309 
lower the lack of the combo is early on
but<00:02:46.239> still<00:02:46.450> getting<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.720> lot<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.870> threes<00:02:47.170> and
