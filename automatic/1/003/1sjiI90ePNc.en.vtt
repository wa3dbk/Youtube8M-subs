00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
comfortably I play ovens that there is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.740 
comfortably I play ovens that there is
my<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.990> spot<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.330> find<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
my my spot and I like to to find the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.620 
my my spot and I like to to find the
ball<00:01:54.930> between<00:01:55.110> lines<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.890> try<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> combine

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
ball between lines and try to combine

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.770 
ball between lines and try to combine
the<00:01:58.170> last<00:01:58.380> fare<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.910> that<00:02:00.060> today<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the last fare and I think that today I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.580 
the last fare and I think that today I
had<00:02:01.080> some<00:02:01.590> chances<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:04.380> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
had some chances to do that and we just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.999 
had some chances to do that and we just
keep<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.280> working<00:02:05.910> on<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.050> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
keep going and working on that and that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.160 
keep going and working on that and that
I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.420> thing<00:02:09.600> will<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.959> better

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
I think that the thing will be better

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:22.789 
I think that the thing will be better
and<00:02:10.290> better<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.500> have

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
and better I think that the is is I have

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.310 
and better I think that the is is I have
more<00:02:22.950> freedom<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.450> deafen<00:02:24.810> so

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
more freedom I don't have to deafen so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.590 
more freedom I don't have to deafen so
much<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:25.920> i<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.340> four<00:02:26.640> players<00:02:26.820> behind

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
much because i have four players behind

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.650 
much because i have four players behind
me<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.989> will<00:02:28.530> work<00:02:28.799> so<00:02:29.220> hard<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.120> i<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.510> be

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
me that will work so hard so i can be

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.530 
me that will work so hard so i can be
closer<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.260> her<00:02:31.470> forward<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.340> maybe<00:02:33.299> more

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
closer to her forward and maybe more

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.440 
closer to her forward and maybe more
ready<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.519> moment<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.940> i<00:02:36.090> get<00:02:36.299> the
