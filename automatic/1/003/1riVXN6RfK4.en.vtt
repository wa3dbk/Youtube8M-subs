surprised he didn't drive a car on the
cobbles<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.810> their<00:00:31.080> fight<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.900 
cobbles so I think it's their fight I
will<00:00:32.430> keep<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.879> eye<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.030> him<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.750> promise

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
dropped even lower so now I didn't know

with confidence growing I felt I could
pick<00:02:41.020> up<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> pace<00:02:41.819> but<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.850> still<00:02:43.150> had<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.360> get

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
pick up the pace but I still had to get

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.760 
pick up the pace but I still had to get
to<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.930> finish<00:02:44.260> line

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to the finish line

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.690 
to the finish line
so<00:02:44.950> wasn't<00:02:45.280> prepared<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> take<00:02:46.060> risks

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
so wasn't prepared to take risks

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.760 
so wasn't prepared to take risks
it's<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.480> high<00:02:48.690> gears<00:02:49.110> play<00:02:49.440> both<00:02:49.650> is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
it's got these high gears play both is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.440 
it's got these high gears play both is
near<00:02:50.040> Mach<00:02:50.220> since<00:02:50.490> I'm<00:02:50.700> neither<00:02:50.880> first<00:02:51.300> nor

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
near Mach since I'm neither first nor

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.570 
near Mach since I'm neither first nor
second

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
second

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.780 
second
to<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.270> gate<00:02:53.800> left<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:55.010> repeat<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.550> gear

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
to the gate left I repeat the gear

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.670 
to the gate left I repeat the gear
ratios<00:02:56.180> might<00:02:56.390> not<00:02:56.630> have<00:02:56.750> been<00:02:56.840> ideal<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.620> I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
ratios might not have been ideal but I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.070 
ratios might not have been ideal but I
was<00:02:57.800> neat<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.220> tidy<00:02:58.490> through<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.240> inflatable

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.150 

the<00:03:03.350> obvious<00:03:03.800> he<00:03:04.370> fled

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.640 

I<00:03:10.220> left<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.240> couples<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.930> final<00:03:12.380> time

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
I left the couples for the final time

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.170 
I left the couples for the final time
and<00:03:12.950> now<00:03:13.100> they're<00:03:13.280> just<00:03:13.490> two<00:03:13.760> more<00:03:13.970> obstacles

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
and now they're just two more obstacles

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:24.290 
and now they're just two more obstacles
to<00:03:14.630> negotiate<00:03:16.270> I've<00:03:17.270> been

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.130 

let's<00:03:25.300> hop<00:03:25.570> in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.820 

and<00:03:31.620> do<00:03:32.010> they<00:03:32.160> finish<00:03:33.560> well<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.800> survived

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
and do they finish well we survived

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.320 
and do they finish well we survived
against<00:03:37.830> all<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.190> odds<00:03:38.220> we'd<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.180> end

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330

in one piece relief doesn't describe it

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.990 
in one piece relief doesn't describe it
well<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.650> looked<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.010> bit<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.280> Mickey<00:03:44.580> Mouse<00:03:44.730> of

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
well I looked a bit of a Mickey Mouse of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.790 
well I looked a bit of a Mickey Mouse of
the<00:03:45.090> first<00:03:45.330> big<00:03:45.630> round<00:03:45.930> about<00:03:46.260> whatever<00:03:46.590> got

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
the first big round about whatever got

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.020 
the first big round about whatever got
going<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.490> other<00:03:47.640> hammer<00:03:47.850> it's

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
going and all the other hammer it's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.860 
going and all the other hammer it's
really<00:03:48.300> good

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
really good

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.050 
really good
pebbles<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.920> backed<00:03:50.220> off<00:03:50.460> but<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.940> was

pebbles I just backed off but I was
could<00:03:51.660> go<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.990> much<00:03:52.080> faster<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.710> couldn't

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
could go so much faster if I couldn't

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.570 
could go so much faster if I couldn't

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.460 

it<00:04:00.410> was<00:04:00.590> great<00:04:00.980> fun<00:04:01.520> to<00:04:02.480> be<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.690> co-driver

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
it was great fun to be a co-driver

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.530
