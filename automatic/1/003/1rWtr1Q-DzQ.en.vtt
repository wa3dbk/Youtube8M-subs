 invite so escape again and what 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.380
 it seems to you if we start this journey 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.400
 by magic kingdom and by hollywood 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.400
 studios let's see it 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.550
 who says huang studies what is the 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.989
 idea is a tribute to the cinema and now 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.670
 flag in which you work in 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.100
 hollywood even though we are in Orlando 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.539
 here in the studio was based power 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 see how effects are made up close 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.769
 special how you work with water 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.989
 the snow the fire is incredible the 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.819
 sensation and the fire being inside a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.899
 movie we had with us and it 's 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.899
 good or pretty 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.239
 This is a great stage for filming 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:02.280
 a scene in a big canyon with a 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.280
 truck really seems 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.820
 I'll see 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.140
 today the post 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.060
 was the one that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 yes 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.370
 good that you do not have to sign a 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.980
 movie or a TV show one 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.960
 video clip or story or whatever the 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.260
 option that could be thought of as natural 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.540
 is to go find a place and do it 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.920
 street in traffic yes that but that to 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.130
 Sometimes it is a problem for 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 filmmakers that is made in hollywood it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.200
 they build outdoor stages that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 it seems really you will think that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.780
 separated in the middle of a new street 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.929
 york 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.150
 but not everything they see is a lie is 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.090
 a great scenography and what it is to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.040
 background is a painting that gives you the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.660
 perspective and the escape for what hallucinations 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.570
 you're in the city of New York 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.190
 known as the backlot oslo of butt and 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.690
 to give you more realism even the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.800
 filming have effects like this 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.420
 almost always when they shoot in scenes 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.910
 night scenes or street scenes notice that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 the tracks are wet because the 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.230
 directors of photography when they drive 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.150
 the light likes the track to be wet 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.360
 because there are more reflections there are more details 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.130
 It gives a different feeling at the time 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.960
 to make a film almost never happens 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.150
 of the dry track always in some 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.020
 when it will use the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.020
 wet track 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.940
 this is chic fan people in the subway a 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.830
 heat down there and we have to walk 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.900
 the whole broadway avenue that is already 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.900
 the lost of the theater follow the tickets 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.080
 this is how you work in the world of cinema 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.120
 boys all these drops to the subway 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.210
 that you see in the series are like this 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.000
 without exit the actors are here if the 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.780
 action 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.780
 asserts 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.920
 and do not believe is the illusion the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.840
 perspective help is a controlled being 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.790
 again I tell them the name is fine 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.950
 I have gone down in the subway 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.980
 it was in the fourth time that you 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 since chips the actual hotel 2 in the iso 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.620
 because you do not know what the facades are 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.620
 you go in there is nothing 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.519
 remember that this trip we have come to 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.769

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.110
