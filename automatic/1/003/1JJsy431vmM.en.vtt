the<00:01:54.990> Syria<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:56.399> still<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> early<00:01:56.939> right

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the Syria it's still kind of early right

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
the Syria it's still kind of early right
now<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.829> guys<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.250> only

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
now as I as you guys can see I only

bought five players so far from Syria

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.670 
bought five players so far from Syria
but<00:02:01.619> i<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.490> air<00:02:03.290> duvets<00:02:04.290> or

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
but i think it was like air duvets or

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.660 
but i think it was like air duvets or
something<00:02:05.009> i'm<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.219> too<00:02:05.340> sure<00:02:05.369> how<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
something i'm not too sure how to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
something i'm not too sure how to
pronounce<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.810> definitely<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
pronounce it will definitely do that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
pronounce it will definitely do that
team<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.160> seemed<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.030> was

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
team it seemed like I think there was

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
team it seemed like I think there was
like<00:02:09.209> 15<00:02:09.660> thumbs<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> comment<00:02:10.739> so

like 15 thumbs up on the comment so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.750 
like 15 thumbs up on the comment so
that's<00:02:11.520> definitely<00:02:11.879> probably<00:02:12.300> my<00:02:12.569> option

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
that's definitely probably my option

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.640
