00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
really pie in the sky I think of the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
really pie in the sky I think of the
greatest<00:01:11.549> thing<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.930> to

this<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.340> brand<00:02:37.580> new<00:02:37.700> technology<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.420> that's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
this is brand new technology and that's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.330 
this is brand new technology and that's
what's<00:02:38.810> interesting<00:02:38.960> for<00:02:39.470> us<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.740> mean<00:02:39.860> we<00:02:40.010> only

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
what's interesting for us I mean we only

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.990 
what's interesting for us I mean we only
really<00:02:41.090> get<00:02:41.240> excited<00:02:41.420> when<00:02:42.020> when<00:02:42.410> we<00:02:42.590> are

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
really get excited when when we are

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.700 
really get excited when when we are
offered<00:02:44.000> an<00:02:44.240> opportunity<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.470> something

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
offered an opportunity to do something

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.920 
offered an opportunity to do something
that's<00:02:46.100> never<00:02:46.340> been<00:02:46.490> done<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:47.660> was<00:02:47.900> a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
that's never been done this was a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.340 
that's never been done this was a
totally<00:02:48.650> new<00:02:48.800> experience<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.640> in<00:02:49.970> 3d<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.810> live

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
totally new experience and in 3d a live

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.830 
totally new experience and in 3d a live
concert<00:02:51.650> takes<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.550> whole<00:02:52.610> different

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
concert takes on a whole different

concert takes on a whole different
damage<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.460> can<00:02:55.460> see<00:02:55.790> how<00:02:55.940> 3d<00:02:56.360> technology<00:02:57.320> will

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
damage I can see how 3d technology will

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.190 
damage I can see how 3d technology will
change<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.370> filmmaking's<00:02:59.090> but<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.750> think<00:02:59.990> this

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
change the filmmaking's but I think this

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
change the filmmaking's but I think this
use<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.280> extraordinary<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.420> moment

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
use of it is extraordinary the moment

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.590 
use of it is extraordinary the moment
and<00:03:02.960> Sunday<00:03:03.710> Bloody<00:03:03.860> Sunday<00:03:04.010> when<00:03:04.550> you're<00:03:05.450> on

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
ambient sound is drained out and so you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.310
