00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.120
 how do I plant a judgment cia 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.650
 did you know that a number 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.980
 hydrangea species 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.190
 in the 16th 17th century approximately through the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 Dutch trade father to the Netherlands 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.780
 have been achieved ok let there are also 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.210
 to come from America and Asia 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.630
 but we do have influence 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.630
 on gas 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.480
 I'm here now in the well say half 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.460
 shadow 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.790
 and that is actually the most ideal place 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.740
 for the hydrangea 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.840
 you should never put in the shade because 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.730
 then you get far too few flowers and 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.340
 you only have one place left 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.680
 in the full sun okay how is it possible 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.670
 go or regular watering 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.670
 during the summer months 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:03.940
 the hole becomes about 2 to 3 times this way 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.399
 big and as deep as the pot 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.139
 is big then I go two 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.689
 plant the different colors 

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:12.479
 roses and the blue 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.460
 because there are indeed differences 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.729
 and okay in the color but also in the way 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.729
 of plans 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:27.039
 and that is the second hole we start with 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.280
 planting the pink hydrangea 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.630
 you just grab the normal pound you 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.630
 sprinkle it at the bottom of the hole 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.319
 just about half the money 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.509
 fill up and then just 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.670
 slightly digging so that the potting soil 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.649
 mix a little with the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.759
 substrate 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:53.489
 so then we grab the plant and if you have it 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.799
 have taken out 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:02:00.250
 in this case it is just nice and moist 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.890
 if it feels small then slightly dry 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.479
 such a stupid old-fashioned tip but he does 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.950
 it really perfect 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.110
 just put it for a few 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.420
 minutes first with water he sucks 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.489
 really full and he gets real 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.489
 good state 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:20.950
 Then he goes into it is still 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.090
 a little too deep 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.090
 just a little bit of land 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.769
 and then fill the planting hole with the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.660
 combination of soil that comes out 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.660
 with some of the same full shit 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.790
 and then last 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.040
 firmly tamping not the gently 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
 just firmly touch that ground 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.800
 nice to connect with the clod of death 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.970
 and cia 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.270
 we take those roots from the cloud 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.610
 looking immediately and that will plant itself 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.410
 Successfully going to move and may well 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.440
 so strike the blue one 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.750
 is going slightly different 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.019
 you have to keep everything that is beautiful blue 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.730
 provide some send ground in this 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.660
 case hydrangea but the case itself 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.410
 garden peat 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.410
 but it is more acidic 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:46.370
 again by mixing then according to 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.870
 look well humid can there 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:56.860
 Immediately you get over with the soil coming out 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.860
 came job turf 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.299
 fill the gap and then beautiful blue 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.489
 hold 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.750
 do some extra hydrangea blue 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.890
 make with that spreading just right away 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 During planting there 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.130
 and of course remain 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:43.140
 firm to stem and after planting 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.000
 always add some water now 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.650
 I just put them in a garden but 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.260
 can also very well on balcony because in pot 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.330
 doing this also perfect is really a picture 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.310
 especially if you are for some strong kind 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.980
 choose with sturdy stems so that the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.290
 flowers not kept and choose a species 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.090
 where that has flowered like a flower 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.220
 you flip that gives new 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.220
 so that blooms on it had been a year
