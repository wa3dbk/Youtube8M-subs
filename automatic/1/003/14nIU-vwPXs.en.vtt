music<00:00:46.620> coming<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.399> why<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.760> be

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
music coming out so why would they be

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
music coming out so why would they be
coming<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.420> new<00:00:48.539> background<00:00:48.960> music<00:00:49.649> for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
coming out with new background music for

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.229 
coming out with new background music for
when<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.039> doing<00:00:50.309> missions<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.789> things<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
when you're doing missions and things I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.240 
when you're doing missions and things I
think<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.500> music<00:00:52.860> might<00:00:53.100> be

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
think that's because this music might be

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
think that's because this music might be
associated<00:00:53.570> possibly<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> release<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
associated possibly with the release of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
associated possibly with the release of
heists<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.640> obviously<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
heists now obviously they don't want to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.119 
heists now obviously they don't want to
give<00:00:57.930> too<00:00:57.960> much<00:00:58.260> information<00:00:58.590> weighing<00:00:59.010> this

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
give too much information weighing this

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
give too much information weighing this
article<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.850> don't<00:01:00.030> directly<00:01:00.449> say<00:01:00.809> you

weeks or a month afterwards because you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
weeks or a month afterwards because you
know<00:01:39.450> rockstar<00:01:39.960> wants<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.350> heists<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.979> be

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
know rockstar wants these heists to be

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.280 
know rockstar wants these heists to be
as<00:01:41.280> good<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.579> possible<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.390> by<00:01:42.720> adding<00:01:43.140> more

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
as good as possible and by adding more
music<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> game<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.310> music<00:01:44.759> choices<00:01:44.970> and

music to the game more music choices and
things<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.049> think<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.500> gonna

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
things like that I think that it's gonna

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
things like that I think that it's gonna
help<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.280> add<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:48.060> depth<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.720> game

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
help you know add more depth to the game

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
help you know add more depth to the game
so<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.500> wrap<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.399> saying

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so they wrap up all of this by saying

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
so they wrap up all of this by saying
that<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.180> new<00:01:51.420> music<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.899> added

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that all of this new music will be added

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.539 
that all of this new music will be added
to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.439> game<00:01:52.619> next<00:01:52.920> month<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> course

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to the game next month and of course

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.209 
to the game next month and of course
today<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> March<00:01:54.869> 31st<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> would<00:01:56.040> mean

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
today is a March 31st so that would mean

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.980 
today is a March 31st so that would mean
April<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.420> depending<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.869> when

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that they're planning before heists and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
that they're planning before heists and
