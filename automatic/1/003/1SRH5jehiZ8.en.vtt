00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
always a ziplock bags and I got a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.900 
always a ziplock bags and I got a
disposable<00:02:31.420> camera<00:02:31.840> too<00:02:32.460> which<00:02:33.460> was<00:02:33.610> kind<00:02:33.790> of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
disposable camera too which was kind of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.230 
disposable camera too which was kind of
odd<00:02:33.970> it's<00:02:34.780> all<00:02:34.960> used<00:02:35.230> up<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:37.030> think

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
odd it's all used up and I think

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.540 
odd it's all used up and I think
somebody<00:02:37.420> dumped<00:02:38.200> some<00:02:38.380> household<00:02:38.890> stuff<00:02:39.220> in

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
somebody dumped some household stuff in

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.170 
somebody dumped some household stuff in
and<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:42.010> camera<00:02:42.370> must<00:02:42.580> have<00:02:42.670> been<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:42.970> with

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and that camera must have been in with

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.810 
and that camera must have been in with
it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.630 
it
got<00:02:45.820> another<00:02:46.060> nice<00:02:46.360> bed<00:02:46.750> set<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:48.430> one's

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
got another nice bed set and this one's

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.840 
got another nice bed set and this one's
a<00:02:48.730> seven<00:02:49.060> piece<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.570> queen-size<00:02:50.050> bed<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.850> I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
a seven piece for a queen-size bed and I

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.370 
a seven piece for a queen-size bed and I
haven't<00:02:52.150> opened<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.480> up<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.750> look<00:02:52.930> at<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.230> yet

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
haven't opened it up to look at it yet

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.180 
haven't opened it up to look at it yet
but<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.560> damaged<00:02:56.560> packaging

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
but I think the damaged packaging

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.860 
but I think the damaged packaging
there's<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.400> few<00:02:57.640> places<00:02:57.760> where<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.330> packaging

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
there's a few places where the packaging

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.410 
there's a few places where the packaging
is<00:02:58.990> damaged<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.670> might<00:03:00.910> be<00:03:00.940> why<00:03:01.240> they

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
is damaged so that might be why they

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.670 
is damaged so that might be why they
threw<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.810> out<00:03:04.320> I've<00:03:05.320> got<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> young<00:03:05.980> Nana's<00:03:07.680> the

apparently maybe just chews them up and

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.410 
apparently maybe just chews them up and
then<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.170> gotta<00:03:20.380> freeze<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.820> I'm<00:03:21.820> not<00:03:22.000> sure<00:03:22.240> I

the box was taped shut and in looking at
this<00:03:50.740> thing<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:55.110> don't<00:03:56.110> believe<00:03:56.410> it's<00:03:56.650> ever

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
this thing I don't believe it's ever

cups through it and it works fine it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.210 
cups through it and it works fine it
obviously<00:04:29.250> had<00:04:29.520> been<00:04:29.550> used<00:04:30.360> before<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:32.070> is

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
obviously had been used before and it is

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.560 
obviously had been used before and it is
exactly<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.060> same<00:04:33.270> model<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.060> have<00:04:36.300> on
