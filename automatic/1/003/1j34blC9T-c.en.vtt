evident<00:00:18.480> today<00:00:18.900> again<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> guys<00:00:19.890> came<00:00:20.189> out

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
evident today again the guys came out

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.970 
evident today again the guys came out
with<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> really<00:00:20.850> competitive<00:00:21.210> atmosphere

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
with a really competitive atmosphere

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
with a really competitive atmosphere
they<00:00:22.980> were<00:00:23.039> intense<00:00:23.519> times<00:00:24.510> maybe<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> little

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
they were intense times maybe a little

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.019 
they were intense times maybe a little
too<00:00:25.260> intense<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:26.160> being<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.490> pads<00:00:26.699> yet

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
too intense for not being in pads yet

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
too intense for not being in pads yet
and<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.420> had<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> keep

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and so we had it we have to keep

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.589 
and so we had it we have to keep

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.030 
down there they really did a good job
utilizing<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.260> was<00:03:07.380> intrigued<00:03:07.829> with

how they did it so I just got into

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.220 
how they did it so I just got into
researching<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.329> then<00:03:12.329> started<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.930> try

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
researching it and then started to try

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.440 
researching it and then started to try
to<00:03:13.290> identify<00:03:13.530> guys<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.700> class<00:03:14.910> last<00:03:15.299> year

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
that potentially could do it worked for

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.509 
that potentially could do it worked for
us<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.320> know<00:03:19.380> we<00:03:19.530> identified<00:03:20.160> about

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
us and then you know we identified about

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.640 
us and then you know we identified about
four<00:03:20.820> guys<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.780> year's<00:03:22.049> class<00:03:22.320> that

four guys in this year's class that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.280 
four guys in this year's class that
potentially<00:03:23.190> could<00:03:23.310> do<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.959> it's<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.079> good

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
potentially could do it and it's a good

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.229 
potentially could do it and it's a good
way<00:03:25.410> for<00:03:25.440> us<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:26.100> team<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:26.640> numbers<00:03:27.090> were

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
way for us a team that's numbers were

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.000 
way for us a team that's numbers were
down<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.720> try<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> get<00:03:28.140> our<00:03:28.290> numbers<00:03:28.470> up<00:03:28.829> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
down to try to get our numbers up a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.830 
down to try to get our numbers up a
little<00:03:29.250> bit<00:03:29.340> quickly<00:03:29.610> somewhere<00:03:30.600> we're<00:03:30.720> going

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
little bit quickly somewhere we're going

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360 
little bit quickly somewhere we're going
to<00:03:30.900> pay<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.200> price<00:03:31.350> for<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.769> in<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.920> back<00:03:32.100> end

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
to pay the price for it in the back end

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.720 
to pay the price for it in the back end
right<00:03:32.640> we<00:03:33.030> were<00:03:33.450> kind<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.110> pulling<00:03:34.920> from<00:03:35.280> from

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
right we were kind of pulling from from

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.940 
right we were kind of pulling from from
years<00:03:36.150> ahead<00:03:36.570> someone<00:03:37.530> we're<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.829> pay

years ahead someone we're going to pay
the<00:03:38.100> price<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:38.820> I<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.000> felt<00:03:39.329> like

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the price for it but I just felt like

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.000 
the price for it but I just felt like
for<00:03:39.690> our<00:03:39.720> program<00:03:39.959> right<00:03:40.380> now<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.620> more

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
for our program right now the more

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.030 
for our program right now the more
numbers<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.060> could<00:03:42.269> get<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:42.840> we<00:03:43.560> would

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
numbers we could get now we would

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.920 
numbers we could get now we would
benefit<00:03:44.430> us<00:03:44.579> not<00:03:44.790> only<00:03:44.820> now<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
how's Ricky town looked at me with

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.050 
how's Ricky town looked at me with
having<00:03:50.080> had<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> spring<00:03:51.010> under<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.640> he's

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
having had the spring under it he's

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.460 
having had the spring under it he's
playing<00:03:52.300> much<00:03:52.480> better<00:03:52.510> than<00:03:53.080> he<00:03:53.200> did<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.380> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
playing much better than he did in the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.979 
playing much better than he did in the
spring<00:03:53.739> I'll<00:03:53.890> say<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.640> know<00:03:54.989> there's

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
spring I'll say that you know there's

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.460 
spring I'll say that you know there's
areas<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:58.150> know<00:03:58.209> Ricky<00:03:58.660> we<00:03:59.020> challenged

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
areas that you know Ricky we challenged

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.900 
areas that you know Ricky we challenged
them<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.650> improve<00:03:59.920> upon<00:04:00.190> over<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.550> summer<00:04:00.790> I

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
them to improve upon over the summer I

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.610 
them to improve upon over the summer I
think<00:04:01.150> his<00:04:01.239> arm<00:04:01.360> strength<00:04:01.660> looks<00:04:01.989> looks<00:04:02.319> much

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
think his arm strength looks looks much

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.430 
think his arm strength looks looks much
better<00:04:02.800> as<00:04:03.069> deliveries<00:04:03.580> better<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:05.140> every

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
it as is individualized I feel like

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.909 
it as is individualized I feel like
they're<00:05:04.090> really<00:05:04.240> playing<00:05:04.479> well<00:05:04.960> as<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> group

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
they're really playing well as a group

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.480 
they're really playing well as a group
and<00:05:06.130> as<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.310> unit<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.900> as<00:05:08.140> a<00:05:08.169> team<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:08.800> even

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
and as a unit and as a team and even

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.159 
and as a unit and as a team and even
before<00:05:09.610> we<00:05:09.940> go<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.150> certain<00:05:10.510> drills<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:11.050> mean

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
before we go to certain drills I mean

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.659 
before we go to certain drills I mean
they're<00:05:11.289> really<00:05:11.500> coming<00:05:11.800> together<00:05:12.039> as<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.430> team

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
they're really coming together as a team

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.150 
they're really coming together as a team
and<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:13.390> feels<00:05:13.570> very<00:05:13.780> genuine<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.320> me<00:05:14.350> watch

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
and it feels very genuine to me watch

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.240 
and it feels very genuine to me watch
that<00:05:15.370> kind<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.669> stuff<00:05:15.880> closely<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.919> I<00:05:18.010> don't

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
that kind of stuff closely and I don't

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.159 
that kind of stuff closely and I don't
feel<00:05:18.430> like<00:05:18.639> guys<00:05:19.150> on<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.510> defense<00:05:19.900> are

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
feel like guys on the defense are

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.290 
feel like guys on the defense are
waiting<00:05:20.680> for<00:05:20.919> another<00:05:21.639> guy<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:21.850> go<00:05:22.090> make<00:05:22.270> a

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
waiting for another guy to go make a

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.420 
waiting for another guy to go make a
play<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:22.870> think<00:05:23.289> they're<00:05:23.470> all<00:05:23.650> understanding

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
play I think they're all understanding

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.920 
play I think they're all understanding
the<00:05:24.520> accountability<00:05:25.210> aspect<00:05:25.630> of<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:25.900> that

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
the accountability aspect of it that

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.870 
the accountability aspect of it that
it's<00:05:26.380> my<00:05:26.650> job<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.130> do<00:05:27.280> my<00:05:27.460> job<00:05:27.490> and

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
it's my job to do my job and

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.810 
it's my job to do my job and
if<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.360> play<00:05:29.570> comes<00:05:29.870> my<00:05:30.110> way<00:05:30.350> or<00:05:30.680> if<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.520> have<00:05:31.670> to

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
if a play comes my way or if I have to

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.790 
if a play comes my way or if I have to
go<00:05:31.940> make<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:32.390> play<00:05:32.630> through<00:05:33.320> sheer<00:05:33.590> effort

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
go make that play through sheer effort

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.950 
go make that play through sheer effort
I'm<00:05:34.310> going<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.640> go<00:05:34.730> do<00:05:34.970> that<00:05:35.150> because<00:05:35.420> that's

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
I'm going to go do that because that's

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.810 
I'm going to go do that because that's
my<00:05:36.140> job<00:05:36.170> and<00:05:36.440> that's<00:05:36.740> what<00:05:37.010> my<00:05:37.370> brothers<00:05:37.730> are

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
my job and that's what my brothers are

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.700 
my job and that's what my brothers are
expecting<00:05:38.300> me<00:05:38.390> to<00:05:38.510> do<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:38.870> don't<00:05:39.380> know<00:05:39.470> if<00:05:39.560> we

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
expecting me to do I don't know if we

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.590 
expecting me to do I don't know if we
always<00:05:39.980> played<00:05:40.250> that<00:05:40.490> way<00:05:40.670> a<00:05:40.700> year<00:05:41.120> ago<00:05:41.240> but<00:05:41.570> I

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
always played that way a year ago but I

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.390 
always played that way a year ago but I
think<00:05:41.900> we<00:05:42.050> were<00:05:42.350> starting<00:05:42.650> to<00:05:42.800> develop<00:05:43.010> that

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
think we were starting to develop that

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.210 
think we were starting to develop that
identity<00:05:43.850> right<00:05:44.120> now<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:45.350> so<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:45.800> part<00:05:46.130> of

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
identity right now and so that part of

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.160 
identity right now and so that part of
it<00:05:46.390> believe<00:05:47.390> me<00:05:47.480> I'd<00:05:47.570> love<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.840> have<00:05:47.900> Leonard

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
it believe me I'd love to have Leonard

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.020 
it believe me I'd love to have Leonard
Williams<00:05:48.440> on<00:05:48.740> our<00:05:48.830> team<00:05:49.010> right<00:05:49.250> now<00:05:49.280> but<00:05:50.000> I

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
Williams on our team right now but I

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.910 
Williams on our team right now but I
think<00:05:50.120> part<00:05:50.720> of<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:50.870> is<00:05:50.960> they're<00:05:51.680> not

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
think part of that is they're not

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.680 
think part of that is they're not
waiting<00:05:52.130> for<00:05:52.280> 94<00:05:52.850> to<00:05:52.970> make<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.210> play<00:05:53.360> they

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
waiting for 94 to make the play they

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.360 
waiting for 94 to make the play they
understand<00:05:54.080> they<00:05:54.410> all<00:05:54.560> have<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.800> do<00:05:54.980> their<00:05:55.160> job

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
understand they all have to do their job

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.500 
understand they all have to do their job
and<00:05:55.580> they<00:05:55.670> all<00:05:55.760> have<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:55.910> make<00:05:56.120> their<00:05:56.330> play

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
and they all have to make their play

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.770 
and they all have to make their play
when<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.200> time<00:05:57.380> comes<00:05:57.820> with<00:05:58.820> Justin<00:05:59.240> out<00:05:59.360> like

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
when the time comes with Justin out like

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.570 
when the time comes with Justin out like
tonight<00:06:00.140> Trey<00:06:00.440> obviously<00:06:00.860> got<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.040> lot<00:06:01.130> of<00:06:01.370> work

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
tonight Trey obviously got a lot of work

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.890 
tonight Trey obviously got a lot of work
I<00:06:01.790> didn't<00:06:01.970> even<00:06:02.150> smell<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.480> Trey<00:06:02.720> had<00:06:02.870> a

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
I didn't even smell that Trey had a

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.170 
I didn't even smell that Trey had a
really<00:06:03.170> good<00:06:03.380> practice<00:06:03.830> tonight<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.430> thought

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
really good practice tonight I thought

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.110 
really good practice tonight I thought
he<00:06:05.300> looked<00:06:05.450> funny<00:06:06.110> like<00:06:06.520> sharp<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:07.760> thought<00:06:07.970> he

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
he looked funny like sharp I thought he

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.090 
he looked funny like sharp I thought he
ran<00:06:08.330> well<00:06:08.690> but<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.080> showed<00:06:09.320> good<00:06:09.500> patients<00:06:10.040> but

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
ran well but I showed good patients but

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.300 
ran well but I showed good patients but

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
there that we're able to work through

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.240 
there that we're able to work through
and<00:06:32.570> we're<00:06:32.870> still<00:06:33.080> utilized<00:06:33.500> in<00:06:33.680> soma<00:06:34.040> some

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
and we're still utilized in soma some

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.310 
and we're still utilized in soma some
we're<00:06:34.400> still<00:06:34.610> utilizing<00:06:35.210> Jalil<00:06:35.510> so<00:06:36.080> we've<00:06:36.170> got

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
we're still utilizing Jalil so we've got

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.200 
we're still utilizing Jalil so we've got
some<00:06:36.500> good<00:06:36.620> packages<00:06:37.130> going<00:06:37.400> it's<00:06:37.910> fun<00:06:38.120> to

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
some good packages going it's fun to

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.030 
some good packages going it's fun to
have<00:06:38.390> more<00:06:38.900> tight<00:06:39.110> ends<00:06:39.410> and<00:06:39.530> probably<00:06:39.770> people

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
have more tight ends and probably people

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.530 
have more tight ends and probably people
thought<00:06:40.190> we<00:06:40.370> would<00:06:40.490> have<00:06:40.670> and<00:06:40.970> those<00:06:41.330> guys

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
thought we would have and those guys

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.170 
thought we would have and those guys
make<00:06:41.840> it<00:06:41.870> someplace<00:06:42.140> too<00:06:42.560> so<00:06:42.830> it's<00:06:43.790> been<00:06:43.970> good

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
make it someplace too so it's been good

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.300 
make it someplace too so it's been good
to<00:06:44.360> just<00:06:44.570> kind<00:06:44.780> of<00:06:45.050> involve<00:06:45.620> everybody<00:06:46.010> in<00:06:46.250> the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
to just kind of involve everybody in the

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.610 
to just kind of involve everybody in the
offense<00:06:46.700> right<00:06:46.850> now<00:06:47.030> and<00:06:47.300> I<00:06:47.540> think<00:06:47.900> that<00:06:48.050> makes

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
offense right now and I think that makes

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.430 
offense right now and I think that makes
us<00:06:48.770> a<00:06:48.980> much<00:06:49.790> more<00:06:50.000> dangerous<00:06:50.210> when<00:06:50.660> you've<00:06:51.260> got

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
us a much more dangerous when you've got

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.440 
us a much more dangerous when you've got
weapons<00:06:51.710> that<00:06:52.130> you're<00:06:52.760> not<00:06:52.880> real<00:06:53.090> sure<00:06:53.120> where

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
weapons that you're not real sure where

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.110 
weapons that you're not real sure where
the<00:06:53.540> balls<00:06:53.720> going<00:06:53.840> all<00:06:54.170> the<00:06:54.260> time<00:06:54.290> a<00:06:54.970> couple<00:06:55.970> of

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
the balls going all the time a couple of

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.000 
the balls going all the time a couple of
the<00:06:56.210> freshman<00:06:56.630> of<00:06:56.690> defense<00:06:57.080> you're<00:06:57.560> deluding

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
the freshman of defense you're deluding

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.640 
the freshman of defense you're deluding
to<00:06:58.070> them<00:06:58.220> may<00:06:58.460> be<00:06:58.520> looking<00:06:59.330> at<00:06:59.600> offense<00:07:00.080> down

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
to them may be looking at offense down

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.100 
to them may be looking at offense down
the<00:07:00.800> line<00:07:01.090> we're<00:07:02.090> not<00:07:02.240> there<00:07:02.450> yet<00:07:02.480> that

the line we're not there yet that

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.360 
the line we're not there yet that

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
through this process of learning our

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.280 
through this process of learning our
defense<00:07:22.820> and<00:07:23.000> developing<00:07:23.570> in<00:07:23.690> the<00:07:23.720> defense<00:07:24.140> as

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
defense and developing in the defense as

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.120 
defense and developing in the defense as
we<00:07:24.830> assess<00:07:25.130> our<00:07:25.250> offense

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
we assess our offense

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.469 
we assess our offense
so<00:07:28.130> they're<00:07:28.610> all<00:07:28.789> playing<00:07:29.090> they're<00:07:29.360> all

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 
so they're all playing they're all

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:30.999 
so they're all playing they're all
getting<00:07:29.660> a<00:07:29.780> lot<00:07:29.900> of<00:07:29.930> reps<00:07:30.229> on<00:07:30.380> defense<00:07:30.770> right

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:31.009 
getting a lot of reps on defense right

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.460 
getting a lot of reps on defense right
now<00:07:31.160> as<00:07:32.120> we<00:07:32.600> work<00:07:32.840> our<00:07:33.020> way<00:07:33.050> through<00:07:33.199> it

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
now as we work our way through it

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.680 
now as we work our way through it
probably<00:07:34.340> if<00:07:34.490> we<00:07:34.639> do<00:07:34.789> anything<00:07:35.240> it<00:07:35.360> wouldn't

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
probably if we do anything it wouldn't

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.450 
probably if we do anything it wouldn't
really<00:07:35.750> happen<00:07:36.199> until<00:07:36.320> we<00:07:36.560> do<00:07:36.710> like<00:07:36.979> we're

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
really happen until we do like we're

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.950 
really happen until we do like we're
going<00:07:37.580> to<00:07:37.639> do<00:07:37.759> with<00:07:37.880> the<00:07:38.000> dory<00:07:38.180> later<00:07:38.600> down<00:07:38.930> the

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
going to do with the dory later down the

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.249 
going to do with the dory later down the
line<00:07:39.139> so<00:07:40.690> we're<00:07:41.690> going<00:07:41.780> to<00:07:41.870> let<00:07:41.900> those<00:07:42.080> guys

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:42.259 
line so we're going to let those guys

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:43.719 
line so we're going to let those guys
work<00:07:42.500> through<00:07:42.650> the<00:07:42.740> defense<00:07:43.070> and<00:07:43.340> learn

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729 
work through the defense and learn

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.249 
work through the defense and learn
everything<00:07:44.030> and<00:07:44.389> see<00:07:44.570> how<00:07:44.660> far<00:07:44.690> they<00:07:44.990> can<00:07:45.020> take

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:45.259 
everything and see how far they can take

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:51.789 
everything and see how far they can take
it<00:07:45.440> do<00:07:46.370> one<00:07:46.520> more<00:07:47.650> or<00:07:48.650> not<00:07:48.919> yeah
