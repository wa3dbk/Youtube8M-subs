00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:20.939
 still want to drag on the barn 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 how to get fucking 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.470
 let him talk about the cc experience 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.510
 that the rubber better need plaster 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 then born there 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.940
 with the show being shot here was here 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.700
 boiled wing 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.960
 a piece of boiled and even right to say 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.220
 this is the standardized this part was 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.400
 boiled here naked boiled 3 2 to blow 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:51.500
 was here quite a difficult repair 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.739
 We all ate the same outer part here 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.739
 was walking 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.050
 as in the original from that side goes if 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.950
 you just putty it putty then 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.950
 cut through 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.590
 then when the car rides a little body 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.060
 walks back and forth once again went to the string 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.150
 here in all like putty 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.310
 then it will crack it will be very ugly not 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.590
 I know if someone would not know after that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.690
 how was the repair here and had to do 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.240
 putty creaked and taped tape and 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.979
 neatly top slung rubber she 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.920
 when it dries meant but as if 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.659
 the end does not dry and it is elastic it 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.940
 tint and stays there in the first place in 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.690
 moisture gets nothing but secondly 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.149
 this crack will not be if it were still 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.039
 I repeat once for putty then 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.590
 all painted beautifully there trunk 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.509
 threw there an extra battery jumped on 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.640
 hummock here so thousands like lightning 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.640
 bad tires 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.189
 like this in the original on the second side 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.130
 We are doing the same itself 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.130
