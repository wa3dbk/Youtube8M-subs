but there were just a couple of seconds
and<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.800> will<00:02:40.040> never<00:02:40.190> seem<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.610> be<00:02:40.700> too

and that will never seem to be too

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:50.679 
and that will never seem to be too
serious

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.179 

quite<00:02:51.689> edge<00:02:51.930> our<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.349> creatures<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.099> it

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
quite edge our little creatures and it

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.890 
quite edge our little creatures and it
was<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> lot<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:54.000> hopping<00:02:54.329> around<00:02:54.450> with

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
was really a lot of hopping around with

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.920 
was really a lot of hopping around with
on<00:02:55.409> the<00:02:55.500> branches<00:02:56.040> or<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> ground<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> in

on the branches or on the ground and in

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.190 
on the branches or on the ground and in
certainly<00:03:04.379> as<00:03:04.680> if<00:03:04.980> there<00:03:05.129> was<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> signal<00:03:05.579> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
certainly as if there was a signal to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.199 
certainly as if there was a signal to
mass<00:03:07.200> exodus<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.980> those<00:03:08.220> are<00:03:08.760> ha<00:03:08.939> laughter

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
mass exodus of those are ha laughter

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.750 
mass exodus of those are ha laughter
than<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:09.659> you<00:03:10.079> are<00:03:10.140> certainly<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.010> took<00:03:11.609> off

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
than just you are certainly and took off

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.149 
than just you are certainly and took off
into<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.090> middle<00:03:12.359> distance<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.109> suppose<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
into the middle distance I suppose the

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.800 
into the middle distance I suppose the
router<00:03:14.430> forage<00:03:14.849> for<00:03:15.000> food<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.480> look<00:03:15.629> for

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
router forage for food you look for

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.199 
router forage for food you look for
water<00:03:15.930> i'm<00:03:16.230> not<00:03:16.379> sure<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.730> seemed<00:03:17.939> to<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
water i'm not sure but it seemed to be a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.000 
water i'm not sure but it seemed to be a
coordinated<00:03:18.989> plan<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.650> well<00:03:19.829> executed

coordinated plan and well executed

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.830 
coordinated plan and well executed
anyway<00:03:20.670> i<00:03:26.150> couldn't<00:03:27.150> bet<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.450> why<00:03:27.629> are<00:03:27.659> these

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
anyway i couldn't bet it why are these

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.309
