00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
and I started canning I thought it would

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.000 
and I started canning I thought it would
be<00:03:10.670> best<00:03:10.940> if<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.420> learned<00:03:11.690> how<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:11.989> pan<00:03:12.530> from<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
be best if I learned how to pan from a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.569 
be best if I learned how to pan from a
book<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.640> not<00:03:13.760> from<00:03:14.090> my<00:03:14.239> mom<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.500> that's<00:03:16.250> how<00:03:16.549> I

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
book and not from my mom so that's how I

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:23.199 
book and not from my mom so that's how I
learned<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.239> can<00:03:17.510> was<00:03:18.280> from<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.459> book<00:03:22.209> so

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
learned a can was from the book so

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.600 
learned a can was from the book so
because<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.440> know<00:03:25.010> what<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> books

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
because of that I know what the books

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.460 
because of that I know what the books
used<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:26.030> say<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.269> know<00:03:26.690> what<00:03:26.810> they<00:03:26.989> say<00:03:27.260> today

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
used to say I know what they say today

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.949 
used to say I know what they say today
and<00:03:28.010> pretty<00:03:28.670> much<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.030> only<00:03:29.120> thing<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:29.780> has

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
and pretty much the only thing that has

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.310 
and pretty much the only thing that has
changed<00:03:30.440> over<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.769> years<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:32.540> procedure

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
changed over the years is the procedure

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.099 
changed over the years is the procedure
about<00:03:34.130> handling<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.850> lid<00:03:35.120> they<00:03:35.510> used<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.870> tell

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
about handling the lid they used to tell

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.150 
about handling the lid they used to tell
you<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.320> boil<00:03:37.310> your<00:03:37.810> lids<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.140> your<00:03:39.290> rings<00:03:39.650> and

you to boil your lids and your rings and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.710 
you to boil your lids and your rings and
then<00:03:41.120> put<00:03:41.480> them<00:03:41.630> on<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.989> jar<00:03:42.260> tightly<00:03:43.190> and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
then put them on the jar tightly and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.759 
then put them on the jar tightly and
that<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:46.630> basically<00:03:47.630> what<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:47.959> still<00:03:48.320> do<00:03:48.560> today

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
ago I was watching a video which was

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.360 
ago I was watching a video which was
made<00:04:00.620> by<00:04:00.650> Bernard<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.690> who<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.620> owner<00:04:03.859> of

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.660 
the ball cannon
and<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.390> man<00:04:06.570> said<00:04:06.990> that<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.320> reason<00:04:07.800> they<00:04:08.490> no

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
and the man said that the reason they no

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.100 
and the man said that the reason they no
longer<00:04:08.700> say<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.390> boil<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.290> lids<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.370> rings<00:04:11.460> is

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
because they found that the boiling

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.210 
because they found that the boiling
action<00:04:16.739> would<00:04:17.720> tend<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.840> scratch<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.709> enamel

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
action would tend to scratch the enamel

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.800 
action would tend to scratch the enamel
on<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.880> bottom<00:04:21.360> sides<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.140> lids<00:04:22.410> and

on the bottom sides of the lids and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.250 
on the bottom sides of the lids and
that's<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.900> first<00:04:25.110> time<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.410> had<00:04:25.680> heard<00:04:25.710> that

before the underside of ball canning
lids<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.960> an<00:04:34.080> enamel<00:04:34.500> coating<00:04:34.920> some<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.220> the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
lids have an enamel coating some of the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.220 
lids have an enamel coating some of the
cheaper<00:04:35.640> lids<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.150> find<00:04:36.510> don't<00:04:36.930> have

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
cheaper lids that you find don't have

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.190 
cheaper lids that you find don't have
that<00:04:37.500> enamel<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:39.120> doesn't<00:04:39.600> matter<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.110> a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
that enamel and it doesn't matter in a

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.220 
that enamel and it doesn't matter in a
lot<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.440> cases<00:04:40.680> but<00:04:41.280> some<00:04:42.060> foods<00:04:42.420> that<00:04:42.690> will

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
lot of cases but some foods that will

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.630 
lot of cases but some foods that will
react<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:44.600> metal<00:04:45.600> such<00:04:45.990> as<00:04:46.020> Tomatoes<00:04:46.890> you

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
react to metal such as Tomatoes you

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.140 
react to metal such as Tomatoes you
probably<00:04:48.740> would<00:04:49.740> be<00:04:49.920> better<00:04:50.130> off<00:04:50.460> using<00:04:50.790> a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
probably would be better off using a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.310 
probably would be better off using a
ball<00:04:51.660> lid<00:04:52.110> because<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.160> enamel<00:04:53.640> coating

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
ball lid because of that enamel coating

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.590 
ball lid because of that enamel coating
versus<00:04:55.320> buying<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:56.280> cheap<00:04:56.850> ones<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.330> don't

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
versus buying the cheap ones that don't

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.550 
versus buying the cheap ones that don't
have<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.080> enamel<00:04:59.270> so<00:05:00.270> anyways<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.110> fill<00:05:01.350> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
have the enamel so anyways I fill the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.880 
have the enamel so anyways I fill the
jars<00:05:01.860> leapin<00:05:02.520> half-inch<00:05:03.030> headspace<00:05:03.890> the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
jars leapin half-inch headspace the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.370 
jars leapin half-inch headspace the
applesauce<00:05:05.430> doesn't<00:05:06.180> make<00:05:06.420> any<00:05:06.630> air<00:05:06.840> bubbles

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
applesauce doesn't make any air bubbles

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.070 
applesauce doesn't make any air bubbles
so<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.860> didn't<00:05:08.100> have<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.280> go<00:05:08.370> through<00:05:08.520> that

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
so I didn't have to go through that

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.610 
so I didn't have to go through that
process<00:05:10.080> and<00:05:10.920> then<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.520> wipe<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:12.320> rim<00:05:13.320> up<00:05:13.530> the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
process and then I wipe the rim up the

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.970 
process and then I wipe the rim up the
jar<00:05:14.000> put<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.210> hot<00:05:15.570> lid<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.350> ring<00:05:16.590> on

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
jar put the hot lid and ring on

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.660 
jar put the hot lid and ring on
tightened<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.270> then<00:05:18.450> set<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
tightened it and then set it in the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.880 
tightened it and then set it in the
canner<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:21.390> stay<00:05:21.600> warm<00:05:21.840> until<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.500> had<00:05:22.710> all<00:05:22.860> of

canner to stay warm until I had all of

canner to stay warm until I had all of
my<00:05:23.040> jars<00:05:23.430> full<00:05:26.270> another<00:05:27.270> thing<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.930> do

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
my jars full another thing that I do

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.020 
my jars full another thing that I do
when<00:05:28.410> I'm<00:05:28.530> canning<00:05:29.130> which<00:05:29.400> seems<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.850> be<00:05:30.000> a

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
when I'm canning which seems to be a

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.740 
when I'm canning which seems to be a
relic<00:05:30.450> of<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.690> past<00:05:30.810> is<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:32.220> can<00:05:32.640> one<00:05:33.060> jar<00:05:33.450> at<00:05:33.720> a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
relic of the past is I can one jar at a

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.020 
relic of the past is I can one jar at a
time<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.890> reason<00:05:35.220> they<00:05:35.370> recommended

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
time and the reason they recommended

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.100 
time and the reason they recommended
that<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:37.590> do<00:05:37.800> this<00:05:38.070> is<00:05:38.400> because<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:39.240> reduces

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
that you do this is because it reduces

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.980 
that you do this is because it reduces
your<00:05:40.170> foods<00:05:40.740> exposure<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:42.030> any<00:05:42.330> airborne

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
your foods exposure to any airborne

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.010 
your foods exposure to any airborne
toilers<00:05:43.860> there<00:05:44.400> can<00:05:44.550> be<00:05:44.810> yeasts<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:45.930> molds

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
toilers there can be yeasts and molds

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.340 
toilers there can be yeasts and molds
floating<00:05:46.800> around<00:05:46.920> in<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.310> air<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.960> if<00:05:48.960> you

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
floating around in the air and if you

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.710 
floating around in the air and if you
fill<00:05:49.980> your<00:05:50.130> jar<00:05:50.370> then<00:05:50.730> quickly<00:05:50.970> cover<00:05:51.360> it<00:05:51.570> then

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
fill your jar then quickly cover it then

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.710 
fill your jar then quickly cover it then
you<00:05:51.840> reduce<00:05:52.020> your<00:05:52.440> exposure<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:53.340> those<00:05:53.720> things

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
you reduce your exposure to those things

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.900 
you reduce your exposure to those things
that<00:05:54.930> could<00:05:55.050> spoil<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.470> food<00:05:58.160> so<00:05:59.160> this<00:05:59.580> is<00:05:59.730> how

me a pressure canner for Christmas when

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.530 
me a pressure canner for Christmas when
I<00:06:23.570> was<00:06:23.690> 20<00:06:24.170> years<00:06:24.200> old<00:06:24.770> she<00:06:25.430> knew<00:06:25.730> she<00:06:26.420> was

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
I was 20 years old she knew she was

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.600 
I was 20 years old she knew she was
supposed<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:27.020> be<00:06:27.200> using<00:06:27.650> it<00:06:27.800> but<00:06:28.010> she<00:06:28.220> didn't

understand

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.260 

so<00:06:34.820> I<00:06:35.200> processed<00:06:36.200> the<00:06:36.410> jars<00:06:37.040> for<00:06:37.460> 20<00:06:37.820> minutes

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.270

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
so when the processing was complete I

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.000 
so when the processing was complete I
turned<00:06:43.790> off<00:06:43.970> the<00:06:44.000> heat<00:06:44.480> remove<00:06:45.140> the<00:06:45.500> lid<00:06:45.800> from

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
turned off the heat remove the lid from

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.920 
turned off the heat remove the lid from
the<00:06:46.100> canner<00:06:46.490> and<00:06:46.850> let<00:06:47.060> it<00:06:47.180> sit<00:06:47.420> for<00:06:47.450> five

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
the canner and let it sit for five
