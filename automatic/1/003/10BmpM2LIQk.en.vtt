00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.960
 hi friends like frei metro is very 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.809
 well and this time I bring you 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.639
 to a review about a new comic that is 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.930
 the death of superman as he was already in 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.620
 this all this is another list of 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.620
 the best says 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 and well 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.119
 as you already know all those editions 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.509
 it has only been the dark knight 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.030
 returns and in this case the death of 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.900
 superman 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.360
 that if we do not have a lot to talk about 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.060
 stay or bad but I had a small 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.750
 surgery and not because that's the reason why 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:47.250
 can not do work video talk 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.300
 but there is a cost of 100 pesos always 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.300
 is Mexican and then 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.950
 is of the same quality that is handled in 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.620
 an earlier model of money cns a 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.190
 pretty ugly pasta 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.940
 very deplorable quality on the part of 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.690
 televises to one especially the color 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.600
 black and with this help of sanborns and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.810
 extras to choose the one that is better and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.540
 still I find myself with one that then 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.259
 the cover is already badly damaged 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.590
 anything is detailed as well as 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.690
 it becomes a bit gray, it becomes a tone 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.390
 grayish is on the covers 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.049
 but then in the interiors the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.400
 quality improves a lot in it feels very 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.270
 well not excellent but it is superior 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270
 to the previous number 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.580
 as I said a cost of 100 pesos and has 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.010
 much of each envelope the cover on the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 comic itself because it can be death 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.159
 of superman or I say that more could you 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.070
 say a battle against the king and about 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.460
 how is it that all this happens how is it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.030
 he dies 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.759
 not only is it not also superheroes before 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.450
 of this I would recommend search 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.490
 wikipedia 2 because it encompasses many 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.410
 superheroes that you may not have been 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.080
 presented is content continuity or 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.960
 they have completely changed their stories 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.210
 and with this the new 52 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 that is to say that the food that is to throw a 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:36.290
 browse and on wikipedia to see what then 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.480
 more more to get in context with this 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.400
 and as I said possible super bad death 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.959
 quality or on paper is very good 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.959
 how I said angular 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.060
 and so 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.060
 after this they would have to 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.490
 to publish the world is and superman 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.299
 the superman return 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.329
 and then each of the ones of the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.290
 permanent that are these jobs and 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.290
 forget your time 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 but then at least we still do not televise 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.080
 he has said nothing about it 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.120
 so I told him then a study 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.300
 interesting as it is the death of 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.300
 superman 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.270
 and because it is all that it 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.960
 interesting as cult you have to 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.380
 read sometime in your life being that if 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.510
 you're a comic book fan and like 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.350
 is a channel announcement reviews 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.790
 about street he had 34 for god that is my 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.790
 pronunciation is true to hear me 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.620
 friends since it is like hope 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.870
 share their relevance leave the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.510
 comments and already the story if you 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.150
 liked the taste to me in the truth because I 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.980
 it's pretty good to strangle but 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.550
 for death superman as I say is 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.550
 a cult comic 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.330
 and then I'm going to follow me in 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.330
 twitter as the record comet frame 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.750

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.140
 they were and they share write 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.140
