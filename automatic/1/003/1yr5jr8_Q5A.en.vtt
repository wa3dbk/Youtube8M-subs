00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.200 
kind of its natural shape so I will take
the<00:02:18.800> AC<00:02:19.640> close<00:02:19.880> Michael<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:21.230> will<00:02:21.620> take<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
corners off when I'm using a dremel I

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.620 
corners off when I'm using a dremel I
will<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:30.670> will<00:02:31.670> just<00:02:31.820> round<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.270> off<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.600> a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
will I will just round it off with a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:43.330 
will I will just round it off with a
dremel<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:38.860> hello<00:02:39.860> chip<00:02:40.220> right<00:02:40.460> there<00:02:42.340> all

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
dremel but hello chip right there all

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.920 
dremel but hello chip right there all
right<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.700> that's<00:02:44.000> not<00:02:44.300> all<00:02:44.450> I'm<00:02:44.540> going<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.750> do

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
right so that's not all I'm going to do

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.620 
right so that's not all I'm going to do
I<00:02:44.960> never<00:02:45.290> take<00:02:45.530> off<00:02:45.680> too<00:02:45.920> much<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.480> can

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
I never take off too much and you can

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.290 
I never take off too much and you can
see<00:02:47.840> how<00:02:48.170> much<00:02:48.320> better<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.710> looks<00:02:49.120> it's<00:02:50.120> not

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
see how much better that looks it's not

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.000 
see how much better that looks it's not
hanging<00:02:50.660> over<00:02:50.930> anymore<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.590> got<00:02:51.800> that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
hanging over anymore and I got that

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.290 
hanging over anymore and I got that
little<00:02:53.620> crack<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.980> she<00:02:55.220> had<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.090> could

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
little crack that she had and I could

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.240 
little crack that she had and I could
probably<00:02:56.720> take<00:02:57.260> off<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> little<00:02:57.710> bit<00:02:57.980> more

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250
