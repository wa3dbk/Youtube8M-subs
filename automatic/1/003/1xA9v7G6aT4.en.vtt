thank you so during the development of

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.590 
thank you so during the development of
the<00:00:50.710> DualShock<00:00:51.129> 4<00:00:51.489> we<00:00:51.699> worked<00:00:52.149> with<00:00:52.329> key

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
the DualShock 4 we worked with key

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.100 
the DualShock 4 we worked with key
partners<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.500> development<00:00:54.160> community<00:00:54.190> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
partners in the development community to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.509 
partners in the development community to
enhance<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.320> feel<00:00:56.559> of<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.860> joystick<00:00:57.309> in<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
enhance the feel of the joystick in the

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.639 
enhance the feel of the joystick in the
trigger<00:00:57.730> buttons<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.660> result<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.469> much

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
trigger buttons the result is a much

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.280 
trigger buttons the result is a much
tighter<00:01:00.100> sense<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.149> control<00:01:01.510> over<00:01:01.629> in-game

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
tighter sense of control over in-game

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.950 
tighter sense of control over in-game
actions<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:03.519> also<00:01:03.670> took<00:01:04.570> this<00:01:04.750> as<00:01:04.869> an

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
actions we also took this as an

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.050 
actions we also took this as an
opportunity<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.500> enhance<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.729> rumble

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
opportunity to enhance the rumble

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.820 
opportunity to enhance the rumble
capabilities<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.840> reduce<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.470> controller

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
capabilities and reduce the controller

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.760 
capabilities and reduce the controller
latency<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.720> finally<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.869> added<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.320> few<00:01:11.710> new

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
latency and finally we added a few new

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.910 
latency and finally we added a few new
features<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.850> touchpad<00:01:13.810> as<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.110> new<00:01:14.590> form<00:01:14.830> of

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920

was<00:01:29.170> designed<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.679> tandem<00:01:30.220> with<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:30.850> second

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
was designed in tandem with a second

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.870 
was designed in tandem with a second
peripheral<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.380> stereo<00:01:33.130> camera<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.729> can

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
peripheral a stereo camera that can

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940 
peripheral a stereo camera that can
sense<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.690> depth<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.320> environment<00:01:35.860> in

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
sense the depth of the environment in

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.340 
sense the depth of the environment in
front<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.429> and<00:01:36.550> track<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.360> 3d<00:01:37.659> position<00:01:38.170> of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
front of it and track the 3d position of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.669 
front of it and track the 3d position of
the<00:01:38.590> controller<00:01:38.950> via<00:01:39.640> its<00:01:40.060> light<00:01:40.360> bar<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.530> hope

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
the controller via its light bar so hope

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.440 
the controller via its light bar so hope

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
of the PlayStation 4 controller the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.800 
of the PlayStation 4 controller the
event<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.610> actually<00:01:45.970> going<00:01:46.090> live<00:01:46.360> right<00:01:46.600> now

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
event is actually going live right now

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.260 
event is actually going live right now
as<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.470> speak<00:01:47.679> so<00:01:48.280> we'll<00:01:48.580> be<00:01:48.700> doing<00:01:48.729> some<00:01:49.000> more

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
as we speak so we'll be doing some more

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.940 
as we speak so we'll be doing some more
videos<00:01:49.600> after<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:50.050> but<00:01:50.440> let<00:01:50.590> me<00:01:50.619> know<00:01:50.709> where

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
videos after this but let me know where

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.169 
videos after this but let me know where
you<00:01:51.009> guys<00:01:51.099> think<00:01:51.369> about<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.610> new<00:01:51.759> controller

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
you guys think about the new controller

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.880 
you guys think about the new controller
I<00:01:52.300> know<00:01:52.420> quite<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.780> few<00:01:52.840> people<00:01:52.959> may<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:53.410> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
I know quite a few people may think the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.229 
I know quite a few people may think the
touch<00:01:54.099> screen<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.489> a<00:01:54.520> little<00:01:54.759> bit<00:01:54.880> redundant
