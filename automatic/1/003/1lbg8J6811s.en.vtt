00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 do you know the common point between 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.170
 james jump the aristocats and vanessa 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.509
 paradise 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.830
 no the answer their music will be 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.880
 all choreographed to the next 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.940
 French swimming championships 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.950
 synchronized organized in chenÃ´ve solo 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.960
 duo or packaged for james bond 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.170
 girls and girls from the club trains for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
 the competition and unsuspecting spectator 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.640
 be careful you will take full 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.640
 the eyes 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.659
 the girls virginia crook 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.230
 repeat tirelessly the same 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.969
 movements 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.249
 nothing is left to chance and especially 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.260
 not the cohesion of equipped video session 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.479
 mandatory especially as the competition 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.829
 approach fast-paced households them 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.690
 not all train together what 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 to two different groups so at this 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 trip in this week only twice 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.170
 really all blood we know that the little 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.079
 of time we have tried to be thoroughly 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 on the workouts and 5 really 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 complementary and pure swimming on 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.869
 really there is apnea in it like 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.759
 you said after that it's true that there is 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.899
 a lot of work techniques to do 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.030
 and also the artistic 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.380
 it's true that it's a sport that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.619
 the dance so they are must be pretty 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 to see and we ask a lot of things 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 the difficulty is not proportional to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590
 number of people in the water charlotte 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.869
 did solos and duets his 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.429
 specialty with her spoon she marks 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 every time on a pole doing it 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.890
 for everything to be synchronized with the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.690
 music 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.530
 meanwhile his eyes are scanning 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.530
 every detail 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.250
 one of the many in lots and then the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 used pipes really has very very 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.370
 very precise sync so as we 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.350
 said just now fingers etc 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.210
 everything must be the same while for a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 soloist which is alone in 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.120
 wrong that it is synchronized finally to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.730
 to be sync with the music 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.780
 but nothing is going to happen to the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.210
 that is all that is technical 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 the height the expression the judges you 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.990
 look at it so necessarily 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.910
 even more expensive than a kabala swimmer 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 8 actually this verdict of the competition 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.500
 from May 3rd to 6th at the center 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.899
 nautical new lime by then we have 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.740
 would resume well and then she sings 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.740
 with a voice here thomas
