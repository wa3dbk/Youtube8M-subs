00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.780
 well welcome to the real world about notation 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.870
 always us but trying to cubes or dealing specifically with five 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.779
 sides 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.779
 the front is people who are looking at us 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:14.460
 above 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 in this case it is the target 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.810
 down that this case is the favorite the right one in this case are red and the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 left in sitting girls there is a way to write movements for 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.000
 to be able to defeat each one these five movements that ended luck even 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.030
 others 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.550
 but for this ain 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.040
 now to use the names in month 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.530
 the front for example is represented as soon 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.230
 above is represented as ap 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.580
 down as a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.210
 left how it reads and right as there is 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.090
 so good susan these letters to make the annotation 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.710
 after employment, yes, I am more eye 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.989
 represents front 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.859
 means turning the front 90 degrees clockwise 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.439
 the movement 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.810
 uu basu popular means ap 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490
 means to create 90 degrees the face to the estuary ignited soy the clock or 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.950
 if I was watching it rotate 90 degrees equaled 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.420
 that would be a secular cougar 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660
 a more ocular TV is to read 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.500
 left stretch 90 degrees the left lit the supermodel 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130
 it will be easy 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.500
 and keep watching it 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.140
 a darker cr of the vrae 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.730
 in turning 90 degrees the right 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.570
 lit the authors of the or guinand in uppercase linda hunt meaning 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 suck 90 degrees the part down disappointed though the clock and always 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.500
 look again at the face we are seeing 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.200
 also to make the movement popolo all that there is the symbol of premium 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.409
 so for example uu bonus means moving the part up 90 degrees against 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.650
 clock 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.600
 this trio most critical the border part of opposite 90 degrees against 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 angel watch 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.250
 of premiums means the abajón 11 degrees against urjaldón the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.389
 r spring and the right not to enter the buyers on the clock 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.190
 yl prima read is 90 degrees against mouth the clock 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.209
 so chacón that I have most of the movements 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.709
 to emphasize that the vein and another time if for example I want to play twice in 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:27.499
 face 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.499
 to represent the double movement 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.130
 it's used 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.779
 the same capital letter for example uu but with a two 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:40.229
 uu 2 means moving twice up I care for which side because that way 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:45.219
 offers positions between the same f2 means moving two front judges 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.399
 l the landmarks and to continue with all the desire 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.649
 well then it ended almost all movements 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.599
 that there are movements that are minuscule for example if I am me 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.099
 lower case 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.010
 efe same as always the vrae the right but menem over one side webos 2 the circ 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.569
 does this would be a crib terrain 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.699
 a land a premium is exactly the same 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.609
 but for the other side 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.609
 Jul efe Tiny is the front grabbing 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.529
 in the bilges something to see it 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.630
 it has tiny prime efe 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.870
 blackboard the two for the opposite side tell you the same thing that we were doing 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.289
 before but grabbing two faces 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.120
 for example 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.789
 uu bonus 2 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:40.040
 the top part ra ra ra games 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.149
 watch the two months 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.829
 why 2 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.420
 finally with this notation in the same to really still is relevant 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.919
 in the df east of france city 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.839
 I have all the movements that can be done in the cube 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.939
 finally that she others that are much more basic than it is for you indycar a 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.039
 rotating cube lineage rotating in the duchess I'm living 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.480
 these movements are 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.539
 x to move it 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.849
 thus 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.709
 this is a movement x 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.769
 x premium to achieve it 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.389
 thus 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.620
 depor pe no irie ampi 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.879
 to move it in this way 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.879
 and bonuses to do the opposite 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.830
 and then 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.690
 sect 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.469
 to move it in this way 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.309
 premium fonseca to do the opposite 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.239
 I'm fine obviously what are the Cartesian axes deprived to the is the type 

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:38.239
 of movement will not only use the pasta at very advanced moments 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.620
 so basically in this way writing on a paper can 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.840
 describe any movement the cube 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.330
 if I for example that being uu r this cousin 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.370
 let's start pointing up sense with the clock 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.020
 r the right-hand sense that the rest 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.509
 and it is that it is important to feel a parallel with a parallel 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.279
 is all there is left to do a raw renfe escape 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 equal to your friend supporting him 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.029
 easyjet or are basically all movements 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.939
 Now I'm going to take advantage of this video to explain a bit about the 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.120
 operation of the kun c 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.539
 the cube has three different types of pizza has six as central 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.370
 which are the ones in the market 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.520
 hadzic to face 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.030
 that are characterized by having only one color if you were in a boat in the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.930
 that the others have two colors was even 3 edison those that indicate the 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.580
 color of català for example here tamarises you enter ethics that attack 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.180
 who really is malice 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.110
 Fortin say that because as much as we strive which rector 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.159
 we will never be able to move it half 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.589
 it is fixed that it is difficult from the middle we can not move it felt we have to 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.830
 have all the side of this gala 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.469
 it is evident that those who will sing have just started the face 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.909
 and so with each of these faces 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.949
 also on coast formed by 8 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.539
 poor vertices 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.669
 quartercourse the vertex those that are in the vertex of each cube 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.949
 and that are characterized by giving three colors each say would be 104 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.669
 I remove 4 ago 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.590
 you have to always leave the vertex to be able to move to another vertex are a 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.300
 pain for putting this coag-a 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.479
 here for example these analysts and never what to put will receive from Tuesday to 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.009
 its against the wall 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.930
 of these 8th are going to move in these eight positions and then 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.219
 I have what are 12 edges 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.059
 which are the edges or the cubes are in what would be the edge of the cube 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.009
 who are characterized by having two colors work 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.419
 who are in these four positions 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.259
 in these four positions here in the middle 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.009
 and finally in these four positions 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:51.860
 that's 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.680
 how a cube was shaped itself and how to write the movements 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.800
 now you are watching this we are ready to puel start assembling the cube 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.360
 from rubik 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.090
 so on the next day 2 as bishop bitterness began to explain with 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.660
 the third beginner method as armed
