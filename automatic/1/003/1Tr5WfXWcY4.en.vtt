cue to go away this is actually a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.200 
cue to go away this is actually a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
good idea to schedule more arrivals or

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.950 
good idea to schedule more arrivals or

21 all three of them are occupied well

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.740 
21 all three of them are occupied well
so<00:02:51.159> indeed<00:02:51.579> there<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:51.849> no<00:02:52.090> space<00:02:52.389> for<00:02:52.659> that

different gates that are labeled and

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.759 
different gates that are labeled and
this<00:03:49.540> display<00:03:49.870> would<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.169> be<00:03:50.349> able<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.650> be

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
this display would it be able to be

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.550 
this display would it be able to be
zoomed<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.400> moved<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.109> could<00:03:53.290> see

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
zoomed and moved so that you could see

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.280 
zoomed and moved so that you could see
what<00:03:54.220> actually<00:03:54.669> is<00:03:54.849> at<00:03:55.120> what<00:03:55.359> gate<00:03:55.629> through

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
what actually is at what gate through

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.680 
what actually is at what gate through
graphical<00:03:57.040> silhouettes<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.760> aircraft<00:03:58.209> you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
graphical silhouettes of aircraft you

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.059 
graphical silhouettes of aircraft you
would<00:03:58.810> be<00:03:58.930> able<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.139> click<00:03:59.409> on<00:03:59.560> them<00:03:59.799> hover

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
would be able to click on them hover

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.069 
would be able to click on them hover
over<00:04:00.519> them<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:00.790> variety<00:04:01.419> of<00:04:01.480> different<00:04:01.659> ways<00:04:01.930> of

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
over them a variety of different ways of

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.240 
over them a variety of different ways of
getting<00:04:02.379> some<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.799> same<00:04:02.980> information

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
getting some of the same information

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.120 
getting some of the same information
we've<00:04:03.730> seen<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.239> other<00:04:04.389> screen

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
we've seen on the other screen

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.090 
we've seen on the other screen
so<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.300> case<00:04:07.570> again<00:04:08.440> since<00:04:08.680> we're<00:04:08.860> trying

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
so in that case again since we're trying

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.220 
so in that case again since we're trying
to<00:04:09.250> emulate<00:04:09.490> reality<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.780> people<00:04:11.020> who<00:04:11.140> have

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
to emulate reality for people who have

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.000 
to emulate reality for people who have
been<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.560> Chicago<00:04:12.070> Miami<00:04:13.500> Phoenix<00:04:14.500> San

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
been to Chicago Miami Phoenix San

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.060 
been to Chicago Miami Phoenix San
Francisco<00:04:15.640> or<00:04:15.940> LA<00:04:16.510> they're<00:04:17.470> going<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.800> be<00:04:17.920> able

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
Francisco or LA they're going to be able

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.360 
Francisco or LA they're going to be able
to<00:04:18.400> see<00:04:18.690> representations<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.890> these<00:04:20.890> airports

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
to see representations of these airports

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.030 
to see representations of these airports
and<00:04:21.700> be<00:04:22.330> able<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.630> see<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.260> aircraft<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:23.860> they

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
and be able to see the aircraft as they

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.980 
and be able to see the aircraft as they
come<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.400> go<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.790> get<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.150> information<00:04:25.450> on

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
come and go and get the information on

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.660 
come and go and get the information on
them<00:04:26.290> as<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:27.010> happens

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670
