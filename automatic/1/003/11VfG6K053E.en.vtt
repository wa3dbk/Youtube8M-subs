00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
right there but it's spawned really

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
personally I do find that this map pack

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.700 
personally I do find that this map pack
is<00:04:32.639> worth<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.150> because<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:34.020> do<00:04:34.169> get<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.410> gun

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
is worth it because you do get a gun

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.740 
is worth it because you do get a gun
which<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.580> Ripper<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.210> do<00:04:36.389> get<00:04:36.570> these

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
which is the Ripper and you do get these

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.200 
which is the Ripper and you do get these
pretty<00:04:36.990> cool<00:04:37.229> for<00:04:37.440> maps<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.639> believe<00:04:38.970> I'm

pretty cool for maps and I believe I'm

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.330 
pretty cool for maps and I believe I'm
not<00:04:39.539> sure<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:39.930> yes<00:04:40.229> on<00:04:40.410> this<00:04:40.530> map<00:04:40.770> if<00:04:40.949> you

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.130 
spawned really close to me I'm not sure
if<00:06:01.090> they're<00:06:01.240> trying<00:06:01.390> to<00:06:01.480> make<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.960> map

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
if they're trying to make the map

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.020 
if they're trying to make the map
shorter<00:06:02.590> so<00:06:02.740> they<00:06:02.860> spawn<00:06:03.160> near<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.640> but<00:06:03.820> or

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
shorter so they spawn near you but or

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.210 
shorter so they spawn near you but or
trying<00:06:04.390> to<00:06:04.480> get<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:04.870> more<00:06:05.290> action<00:06:05.680> but<00:06:05.800> it<00:06:05.830> does

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
trying to get it more action but it does

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.460 
trying to get it more action but it does
seem<00:06:06.490> more<00:06:07.060> fast-paced<00:06:07.540> now<00:06:07.960> because<00:06:08.320> the

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
seem more fast-paced now because the

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.200 
seem more fast-paced now because the
spawns<00:06:08.830> are<00:06:09.070> really<00:06:09.370> close<00:06:09.610> which<00:06:09.910> is<00:06:10.060> what

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
spawns are really close which is what

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.700 
spawns are really close which is what
