00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.690
 the reality of public universities in it but quite complex 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.949
 and leaves a lot to be desired 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.900
 now to last issued this decree of urgency to 0 37 2010 issued by the month 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.769
 what 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 It helped me a lot to solve the issue but it was a norm 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.269
 that was necessary in the current context this decree of urgency was necessary 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.699
 to be able to ensure that the fiscal targets for this year and the 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.930
 next and is that the accelerated pace of spending was alien to ours 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.970
 worries once 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.510
 would have made the next government have to make a pretty adjustment 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.670
 severe what the etarra 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.040
 was going to result more in such a serious problem 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.630
 another that is agreed upon beginning to generate certain inflationary pressures 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.070
 that also hands is a risk that runs 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 and finally there is this fact if there was any situation 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.310
 difficult as a second crisis or a rebound from the crisis 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.370
 this would have reduced the capacity of the state to react to something 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.260
 so articles 3 where I was really worried 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.060
 defines what two public investment projects that had not yet 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.270
 been initiated in national universities 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 they could only be executed up to 25% 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.100
 this refers only to investment projects refers to the budget 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.070
 total of universities in that sense in fact some stretches the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.620
 leaders of some public months have been misinforming 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.909
 p saying that it is a budget reduction 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480
 total in this because it does not end up being 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.540
 true still so by the way you have to take into account that many 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.310
 public universities never finish executing the budget that is 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.970
 assigns for just the investment pt for example the inertia san marcos in the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.090
 2009 only 56% was enough 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.370
 of sutspet the budget that was assigned for investment expenses 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.550
 this percentage is below the average of public finances in 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.360
 general which was 75 percent 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.860
 as it is obvious this measure tena can be a specific context of a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.240
 quite specific concern but it will not help solve the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.570
 problematic of public universities this time is not going to solve 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.110
 nor with more money what has to be done is to reform the framework in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.299
 which work 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.799
 age and up to three fields of action that have to be addressed definitively 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.779
 one is to promote more research for less is not 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.829
 supposedly produce knowledge and transmit emerging generations neme the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.179
 which no further investigation is encouraged 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:46.039
 s that function c as you think it makes it difficult in any case a second point 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.069
 has to do with the other options that exist besides the university when 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.909
 one leaves the school take seriously one has copper for a race 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.370
 university fact 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.959
 if one of these analyzes that have been made in the Peruvian labor market 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.049
 watch 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.029
 one of the foo in most of the since in the greatest demand in 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:09.019
 reality are generated from technical institutes and the third point is 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.330
 he has to do with the issue of accreditation we are a joke more 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.969
 much more strict and effective supervision 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.489
 not only the initials but also the technical effects 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.899
 way that we can this assured to efe the boy saleta luminosidad or joao 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.649
 of which the toto 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:32.619
 is going to be a person who reigns at work and who received an education and 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.279
 meets certain quality standards
