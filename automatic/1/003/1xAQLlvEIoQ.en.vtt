00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
saying long or short which we'll get

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
saying long or short which we'll get
into<00:00:58.140> later<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.100> the<00:01:00.090> Bulls<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.690> control

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
into later but the Bulls are in control

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.210 
into later but the Bulls are in control
it<00:01:01.379> means<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> why<00:01:03.140> does<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
it means it's going up and why does it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.469 
it means it's going up and why does it
mean<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.790> why<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
mean it's going up why do they use the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
mean it's going up why do they use the
term<00:01:06.689> Bulls<00:01:06.930> well<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.920> reason<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.280> use<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
term Bulls well the reason they use the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219 
term Bulls well the reason they use the
term<00:01:08.760> Bulls<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
term Bulls is because the way the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
term Bulls is because the way the
animals<00:01:10.710> attack<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.700> Bulls<00:01:11.939> typically

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
animals attack the Bulls typically

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
animals attack the Bulls typically
attack<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.229> upward<00:01:13.439> pattern<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
attack on an upward pattern and the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.230 
attack on an upward pattern and the
Bears<00:01:15.240> typically<00:01:15.900> attack<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> downward

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
Bears typically attack on the downward

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
Bears typically attack on the downward
clawing<00:01:18.240> pattern<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.229> that's<00:01:20.009> basically<00:01:20.400> all

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
clawing pattern so that's basically all

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
clawing pattern so that's basically all
it<00:01:20.640> means<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> Bulls<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.900> control

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it means if the Bulls are in control

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
it means if the Bulls are in control
that<00:01:22.530> means<00:01:22.680> stocks<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that means stocks are going up if the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
that means stocks are going up if the
Bears<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.780> control<00:01:25.110> stocks<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.799> going

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
Bears are in control stocks are going

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.450 
Bears are in control stocks are going
down<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> bull<00:01:28.040> for<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> certain

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
down you could have a bull for a certain

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
down you could have a bull for a certain
stock<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.119> bull<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.900> McDonald's<00:01:31.590> would

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stock like a bull for McDonald's would

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.510 
stock like a bull for McDonald's would
mean<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.640> okay<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.220> you're

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
mean that okay you're you know you're

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.749 
mean that okay you're you know you're
long<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.450> positive<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.259> McDonald's<00:01:37.950> if

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
long or you're positive on McDonald's if

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.910 
long or you're positive on McDonald's if
you're<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> bear<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:40.170> McDonald's<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.799> have

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
you're a bear for McDonald's you have

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
you're a bear for McDonald's you have
negative<00:01:41.329> mindset<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
negative mindset or you think that the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.260 
negative mindset or you think that the
stock<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.430> McDonald's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
stock is going to go down for McDonald's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
stock is going to go down for McDonald's
so<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.170> means<00:01:46.380> Bulls<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so that's all it really means Bulls are

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.050 
so that's all it really means Bulls are
up<00:01:47.640> Bears<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.490> stock<00:01:50.700> market

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
up Bears are down in in the stock market

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
up Bears are down in in the stock market
and<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.479> based<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> animals

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and it's based on the way the animals

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.070 
and it's based on the way the animals
attack

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080
