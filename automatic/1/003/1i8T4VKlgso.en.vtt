00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.040
 when friends I will teach you how to do 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.040
 a 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.620
 this tournament will be good the truth very 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.730
 easy just by occupying a disk tower 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.570
 so stay here they are 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.380
 to put the disk 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.560
 um 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.029
 a mouse 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 the 1900 wire 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.120
 but I am yours is wired 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.540
 they just make a hole around here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.810
 back to get the wire 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 well the truth is very easy just 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.720
 they have to put the mouse by teams of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.490
 work and latorre the mouse make a 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.170
 picture out here that the scroll by 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.470
 from outside 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.530
 they leave it this way out 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.690
 and so 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.640
 they make a picture here but we can 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.989
 put the mouse that the scroll is left 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.019
 it was a 1 me to be able to put the tower 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.180
 disks and then obviously what 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.020
 they need is also 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.440
 a good disc this is a double disc 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.280
 so to be able to get to the electronics 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.720
 we are simply ready and sent it 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.700
 here 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.360
 and here you have to be jazz turntable 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 and so 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.960
 where you want to connect the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:38.080
 usb for here is wireless and good 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.080
 put the virtual dj 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.170
 you put it on the mouse here in the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.170
 promotion district 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:59.210
 and because it is a very short nest 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.859
 but I think they will know and if they can 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.530
 do this totally because the truth 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.280
 very easy only occupy for example a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.740
 home 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.830
 scissors obviously and tape isolate 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.050
 I'm going to repeat the process again. 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.760
 picture to put the mouse by outside 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.190
 because scroll can tape it for 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.950
 inside and outside and they make a hole for 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.170
 can put the tower discs by which 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.620
 underneath they stick the mouse 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 and they put in the record tower and they're going to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.990
 to stay like this after they put their disk 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.030
 here 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.300
 not connected by usb the mouse 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.900
 in my case it's wireless with stations 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.900
 of the virtual dj 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.540
 any version but they are not 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.000
 forgot to put the mouse on the disk 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.490
 otherwise the scratch will not occur 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.490
 can here in the district and do this 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.940
 otherwise if you put out for 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.900
 nothing will happen 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.900
 today as they have it 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:16.880
 and well that 's all 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:21.530
 I say goodbye I'm spot after records and 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.400
 Well, this was like making your turntables 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.730
 coffee was with the mouse two discs of 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.920
 importance if you are not virgins and a 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.530
 disk tower are a support for the disk 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.530
 well that was it until then
