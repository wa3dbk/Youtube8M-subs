00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.730
 my name is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.269
 good I am 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 for every family 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.910
 studies 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.910
 I 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.450
 Basically it's the knowledge 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.100
 or I want 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.740
 this time to call interests in the 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.910
 area English because we have so many 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.100
 have english texts 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.200
 and the second is mathematics 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.700
 so to speak the fundamentals discipline the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.450
 you have to bring in order to be successful 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.450
 to pass the study 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.990
 Of course, what's fun is fun 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 also, ultimately, that there is less one 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.430
 study counseling but generally the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.590
 Advice for the students there 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.030
 what will become of them so you have to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.250
 study advisor and is therefore one 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.630
 Maybe he did not differ too soon 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 only a consultation that I study 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.970
 but you have to change the perspectives to ma 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 that is, what happens when they do 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.809
 where did the bachelor come from? 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.900
 in the master where do you want to go afterwards 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900
 in 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.909
 the personal conversation 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.060
 I think I can always describe more 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.280
 than all the books it over to 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.530
 study entry gives the introduction to the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.549
 Psychology is because I can believe 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.610
 I recognize relatively well in the conversation where 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.380
 the deficits are in the perception of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.759
 psychology and the history pure 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.350
 that is when someone says I am 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.490
 necessarily make social psychologist then 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.229
 I actually talk less with that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.039
 lever social psychology but what 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.039
 psychology is still 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.500
 i live in eating that 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.229
 until I take home a bit there 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.270
 then my family waits, as it were 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.370
 me and first line my four year old 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.830
 son and in january comes my second 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.140
 Son so that it is a point first 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.460
 who occupies me so well so too 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.020
 please others that I am second 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.479
 I do when I have time I football 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.860
 So these are so points and the third 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.670
 is reading that in the train when i am here 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.670
 drive back in pfund 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 I like to go 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.080
 back in the summer in the beach and it 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.000
 there like bratwurst if that will make the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.930
 I do not know but it is the tastiest 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 nice place 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.790
 What I really like is when 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.160
 to be asleep at night that is 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.790
 actually sounds very reassuring 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.790
 of nutrients
