today this is the maverick optic so a
lot<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.550> guys<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.760> been<00:00:08.940> asking<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.540> me

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
my input on this head I got this from

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.150 
my input on this head I got this from
lacks<00:00:14.759> calm<00:00:18.289> there's<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.350> lot<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.619> say<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:19.800> it

from<00:00:20.699> Africa<00:00:21.060> gets<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.270> big<00:00:21.689> step<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.320> their

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
from Africa gets a big step in their

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.400 
from Africa gets a big step in their
head<00:00:22.710> production<00:00:23.600> starting<00:00:24.600> from<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.050> metra

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
head production starting from the metra

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
head production starting from the metra
metric<00:00:28.410> there<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.740> go<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> metric<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.640> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
metric there we go the metric so this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.620 
metric there we go the metric so this
would<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.150> there<00:00:30.449> optic<00:00:31.700> both<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.030> those<00:00:33.270> has

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
would be there optic both of those has

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.360 
would be there optic both of those has
the<00:00:33.809> metric<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> optic<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:34.890> top<00:00:35.219> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the metric and the optic are very top of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.319 
the metric and the optic are very top of
the<00:00:35.430> line<00:00:35.550> heads<00:00:35.820> both<00:00:36.540> made<00:00:37.110> us<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.070> very<00:00:39.059> very

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the line heads both made us a very very

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
the line heads both made us a very very
good<00:00:39.540> construction<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.350> design<00:00:41.149> but<00:00:42.149> today

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
good construction and design but today

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.389 
good construction and design but today
the<00:00:42.719> optic<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> say<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.870> probably<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the optic I have to say is probably to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.400 
the optic I have to say is probably to
date<00:00:47.550> their<00:00:47.730> best<00:00:47.760> head<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.960> probably<00:00:49.260> will

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
date their best head and probably will

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.240 
date their best head and probably will
be<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.739> while<00:00:50.960> reasons<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
be for a while reasons for this is that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.029 
be for a while reasons for this is that
on<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> plastic<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.920> they

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
on first of all the plastic that they

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.830 
on first of all the plastic that they
made<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> lot<00:00:57.329> better<00:00:57.510> than<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
made it out of is a lot better than the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.029 
made it out of is a lot better than the
previous<00:00:58.020> plastic<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.590> used<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:58.859> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
previous plastic they used to use in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
previous plastic they used to use in
their<00:00:59.129> heads<00:00:59.340> this<00:01:00.270> plastic<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:00.989> similar

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
their heads this plastic is very similar

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.270 
their heads this plastic is very similar
to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.770> plastic<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.730> STX<00:01:03.149> Italian<00:01:03.739> same<00:01:04.739> matt

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to the plastic and STX Italian same matt

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
to the plastic and STX Italian same matt
white<00:01:05.549> finish<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.930> really

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
white finish to it actually I really

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.600 
white finish to it actually I really
like<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.770> came<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.460> probably

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
like how that came out so it's probably

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.570 
like how that came out so it's probably
going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> die<00:01:08.909> exactly<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> Stein<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
going to die exactly like a Stein a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.440 
going to die exactly like a Stein a
bright<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:13.070> here<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.580> fire<00:01:15.180> Die

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
bright here here is the fire Die

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
bright here here is the fire Die
stallion<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.009> sale<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.729> does

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
stallion I also have on sale but it does

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
stallion I also have on sale but it does
the<00:01:18.210> exact<00:01:18.509> same<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> has<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> very

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the exact same way because it has a very

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.539 
the exact same way because it has a very
matte<00:01:20.430> finish<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.470> not<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.680> mad<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
matte finish to it not as mad as the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
matte finish to it not as mad as the
optic<00:01:23.820> I'd<00:01:23.939> say<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.689> bit<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> gloss<00:01:25.170> but

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
optic I'd say a little bit of gloss but

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.870 
optic I'd say a little bit of gloss but
it's<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:25.860> similar<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> optic<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it's very similar to the optic so here I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's very similar to the optic so here I
have<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.869> strung<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.500> classy<00:01:31.829> on

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
have this one strung up all classy on

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.520 
have this one strung up all classy on
white<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.360> mid<00:01:33.840> pocket<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
white with a mid pocket and the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
white with a mid pocket and the
reasoning<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.670> midlow<00:01:36.150> pockets<00:01:36.570> or

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
reasoning for this or midlow pockets or

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.469 
reasoning for this or midlow pockets or
is<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> rail<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
is that you can see this rail that I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.210 
is that you can see this rail that I
think<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.750> called<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> dual<00:01:40.259> rail<00:01:40.740> system

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
think it's called a dual rail system

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.490 
think it's called a dual rail system
that<00:01:41.400> they've<00:01:41.549> made<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> points<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that they've made but it points the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
that they've made but it points the
offset<00:01:44.460> starts<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:45.360> peak<00:01:45.750> right

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
offset starts at this very peak right

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649 
offset starts at this very peak right
here<00:01:46.399> on<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> side<00:01:47.820> wall<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> right

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
here on the side wall which is right

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.149 
here on the side wall which is right
here<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.470> where<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:49.950> your

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
here and that's where you want your

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.399 
here and that's where you want your
pocket<00:01:50.490> placement<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.750> head<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:52.049> designed

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
pocket placement this head was designed

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.359 
pocket placement this head was designed
for<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.000> midlo<00:01:54.000> pocket<00:01:54.479> placement<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.369> don't

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
for a midlo pocket placement I don't

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.520 
for a midlo pocket placement I don't
know<00:01:56.430> why<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.119> um<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.750> works<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.110> well<00:01:58.259> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
know why but um it works really well I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
know why but um it works really well I
as<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.490> has<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.670> little<00:01:59.939> bit<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
as you can see this has a little bit of
