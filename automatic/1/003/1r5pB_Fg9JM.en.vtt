00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.679
 and so literally several 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:04.020
 minutes 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.140
 the same time as we 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.549
 started the engine and air conditioning on 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.719
 heating 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.249
 already seen in front 106 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.659
 crimped things specks 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.529
 it melts and melts our snowball 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.019
 enough temperature just 0 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.749
 degrees Celsius 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.619
 in order to transform 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.109
 from the composition I betray 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 and in quadriga crystals 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 typical handed out how do you know what you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.640
 water has a state today 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.070
 so we end up with this snow in one 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.360
 of states 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.740
 although let's see how 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.550
 our brushes work at the same time 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.580
 This is also a very interesting point. 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.190
 because snow is a lot 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 and on the front windows 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.970
 well that's how you are 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.030
 still does an excellent job with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720
 roadster what is he 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.150
 clean 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.950
 our all cats 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.400
 and of course 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.640
 we see with the necessary which 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.210
 the basis of what for 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.450
 she comfortable travel these brushes 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.299
 provide 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 driver's 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 the cyclone is huge enough 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 room for 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.229
 apparently wall by h 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.730
 yes he is good without review 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.120
 no very very decent 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.170
 but by the eviction process of course 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230
 there is 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.390
 in a letter that was unrefined but in 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.120
 the squeal process Viktor onopko that also 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.920
 will be 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.300
 destroyed getting 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.750
 behind us 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.520
 no cleaning was done by us 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.830
 name to judge 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 Paris but on the side of the brush mesh 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.380
 but with us and also heating and rear 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 glass 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 in which also the process must 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.130
 to step on 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 and we will clean the rest with 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.270
 brushes though this one had to do the most 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 beginnings 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.809
 but once again I will repeat the accounts yet 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.639
 I am responsible for the bill
