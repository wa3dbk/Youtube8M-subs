this works and what I have found out to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
this works and what I have found out to
be<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> truth<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:36.930> experience<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.770> which

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
be the truth in my experience in which

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.090 
be the truth in my experience in which
people<00:00:38.190> live<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:39.390> treated<00:00:39.660> many<00:00:40.590> studies

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
people live I have treated many studies

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729 
people live I have treated many studies
that<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:42.000> shown<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.710> anybody's<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that have shown that anybody's a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.910 
that have shown that anybody's a
diabetic<00:00:44.250> has<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> 50%<00:00:45.329> better<00:00:45.480> chances<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
diabetic has a 50% better chances of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
diabetic has a 50% better chances of
developing<00:00:47.789> cancer<00:00:48.770> now<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.820> tells<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
developing cancer now but that tells you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.729 
developing cancer now but that tells you
if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> look<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:52.550> what's<00:00:53.550> actually<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:54.090> on

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
if you look at what's actually going on

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.020 
if you look at what's actually going on
everything<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> eat<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> converted<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
everything we eat is converted in the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
everything we eat is converted in the
final<00:00:57.360> stages<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.930> converted<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.530> glucose

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
final stages it converted to glucose

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.319 
final stages it converted to glucose
every<00:00:59.969> single<00:01:00.359> thing<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.719> eat<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.149> we

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
every single thing we eat so the way we

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.990 
every single thing we eat so the way we
have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:03.870> look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.610> normal

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
have to really look at this the normal

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.570 
have to really look at this the normal
range<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.479> blood<00:01:06.750> sugar<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.920> somebody<00:01:08.310> checks

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
range in blood sugar if somebody checks

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
range in blood sugar if somebody checks
your<00:01:08.760> blood<00:01:08.970> Sugar's<00:01:09.360> between<00:01:09.840> 70<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> most

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
your blood Sugar's between 70 and most

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.140 
your blood Sugar's between 70 and most
99<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.180> 100<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.770> no<00:01:14.250> matter<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> person

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
99 or 100 so if no matter what a person

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
99 or 100 so if no matter what a person
is<00:01:15.240> eating<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.990> their<00:01:16.650> blood<00:01:16.950> sugar<00:01:17.310> range<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is eating if their blood sugar range is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.850 
is eating if their blood sugar range is
between<00:01:18.049> 70<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> 100<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.860> 142

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
between 70 and 100 and if it's on 142

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
between 70 and 100 and if it's on 142
hours<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:23.759> they'd<00:01:24.000> read<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.720> normal

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
hours if they'd read that's the normal

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
hours if they'd read that's the normal
range<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.130> no<00:01:26.220> matter<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.610> you're<00:01:26.850> reading

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
range so no matter what you're reading

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.499 
range so no matter what you're reading
if<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:28.470> blood<00:01:28.799> sugar<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.460> under<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> hundred

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
if your blood sugar is under a hundred

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.980 
if your blood sugar is under a hundred
and<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.680> never<00:01:31.890> goes<00:01:32.100> above<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> hundred<00:01:32.990> what's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and it never goes above a hundred what's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
and it never goes above a hundred what's
your<00:01:34.170> reading<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.210> means<00:01:36.210> nobody

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
your reading that means nobody

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.700 
your reading that means nobody
everybody's<00:01:37.619> pretty<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> same<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
everybody's pretty much the same so but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.249 
everybody's pretty much the same so but
if<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.549> tell<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:42.060> much<00:01:42.299> sugar

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
if that would tell you how much sugar

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
if that would tell you how much sugar
the<00:01:43.409> cancer<00:01:43.829> cell<00:01:44.070> would<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.250> getting<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.630> we

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the cancer cell would be getting so we

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
the cancer cell would be getting so we
have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.049> look<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.409> what's<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> our

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
have to look at what's going on in our

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.139 
have to look at what's going on in our
chemistry<00:01:48.380> everybody<00:01:49.579> no<00:01:50.579> matter<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.850> they

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
chemistry everybody no matter what they

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.080 
chemistry everybody no matter what they
read<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:52.049> about<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.560> they're<00:01:52.740> reading<00:01:53.090> if

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
read what about what they're reading if

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
read what about what they're reading if
your<00:01:54.299> blood<00:01:54.479> Sugar's<00:01:54.810> under<00:01:54.899> 100<00:01:55.820> everybody

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
your blood Sugar's under 100 everybody

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.600 
your blood Sugar's under 100 everybody
is<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> same<00:01:57.149> boat<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:59.189> real

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is in the same boat here if the real

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.719 
is in the same boat here if the real
problem<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> window<00:02:00.810> between<00:02:01.399> two<00:02:02.399> hours

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
problem is that window between two hours

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.459 
problem is that window between two hours
here<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.119> eat<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.780> cancer<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
here to eat if you have cancer that you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
here to eat if you have cancer that you
have<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.860> very<00:02:05.009> very<00:02:05.280> careful<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:06.030> course

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
have to be very very careful of course

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.160 
have to be very very careful of course
then<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.179> cancer<00:02:09.509> cell<00:02:09.810> thrives

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
then we know that a cancer cell thrives

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
then we know that a cancer cell thrives
