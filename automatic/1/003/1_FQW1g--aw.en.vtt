00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.779
 very good to all youtube patients 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.600
 that you are welcome to a 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.450
 new video hopefully it will also be 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.280
 upload youtube at 60 fps is because I'm cool 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.920
 because I like it even though I throw all the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.159
 fucking night uploading the video welcome 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.550
 I think it's the combat map in 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:23.859
 domain a game that will be good 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.560
 amazing I swear that the command had it 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.169
 me and not another person that you can think 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.329
 that dominates with the last ones that I that 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.160
 sure there are zillions but it 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.130
 that this call of duty tachán tachán 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.500
 it turns out that I am doing fairly well and 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.660
 in fact this game that was equal the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.810
 fourth or fifth game that plays because 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.370
 I'm level 10 11 with the double theme 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.420
 experience goes up pretty fast and 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.410
 finished with level 14 that wizard 136 91 nothing 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.210
 it is a barbarity taking or taking 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 positions taking flags in the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.530
 domain is an absolute barbarity 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.150
 taking out all the gusts and even 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.829
 gusts that I did not even know I had to 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.770
 he ended up throwing the tanks late 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.360
 that they touch me a package in a good 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.430
 now it has a different name 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.860
 and taking out turrets that certainly not 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.850
 they work are remote but I think that 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.830
 they are also activated automatically 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.170
 believe and if not then it is a shit of 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.900
 gusts the gusts are pretty bad in 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.590
 this game is pretty bad I want to say 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.280
 that are not very so they are not very 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.620
 powerful and they have me have that in 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.600
 Embers because I do not know if it's good or bad 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.430
 It's bad because it's not so fun 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.280
 Take off streaks but it's good because 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.050
 Like people do not surround you so much with such 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.580
 to take off the gusts and eye the mouse 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.890
 talking about gusts that I'm 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.630
 taking out here because I've already been peeled 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.400
 a few and wait for what you 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.040
 I will go dark because here they are going to 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.050
 start to come more and I do not know how much is 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.369
 the good streak I let you tell it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.680
 you and I put it in the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.590
 comments what the time that I've been 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.350
 I already live and send people because it's going to be 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.780
 amazing here I got the word see is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.899
 shit or this is the most streak 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.479
 high that I was wearing and it sucks 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.819
 finished this yes killing one or two you have 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.010
 to go around with him 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.129
 co jug be on top you have to aim 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.409
 very much and give them very well and go see 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.060
 the belly is going to really be super 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.909
 well also see me in pro plan 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
 player defending like a Cossack 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.060
 killing people and already while I'm going to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.829
 go commenting what I thought about this 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.439
 color says that more surprised 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.880
 pleasantly so I did not have 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:38.150
 absolutely none 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.700
 no preconceived idea if before and the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.710
 it's true that I loved it 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.720
 liked much the same of all month I say 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.090
 Small shit but right now 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.060
 basically what I can get to him 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.920
 ask for a game is that I have fun and this 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 game does it does it and it does 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.140
 basically because he has corrected one of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.030
 his biggest mistakes are the errors that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.780
 they had already committed from the time 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.580
 while a streak continues I and I 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.330
 you know I'm not going to do a quad 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.180
 look at the fit because I'm going to go now 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.810
 same is going to be filled or is it already 3 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.600
 now two more are already five eleven is I do not know 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.030
 if it 's a quasi-consider I do not know but the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.130
 I really have a mouse here 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.110
 flips 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.210
 what I said to you have corrected one of the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.760
 biggest mistakes that is the subject of the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.580
 connection I do not know if they are servers 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.580
 dedicated I have been told that I have heard that 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.900
 nexgen yes but that in play 3 and xbox 360 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.060
 no I do not know in the end frankly it gives me 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.310
 same because if they are dedicated servers 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.200
 I understand that it works well because it works 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.450
 quite well at least in the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.070
 games that I have been playing in play 4 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.120
 I give you my word 'that work 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:56.560
 quite pretty well I do not know about myself in another 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.370
 consolation or in play 4 but I do not know the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.570
 truth and if spirit pierre as always 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.220
 I will consider what is wrong 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.530
 because this is already part of the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.750
 past but the truth is that it is very 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.600
 well done very well implemented and as 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.830
 minimum works well and the truth is that 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.350
 is pretty good and the issue of 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.870
 gusts is what I have told you not 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.520
 I do not know maybe if they were more powerful the 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.200
 people would change more it's clear that this 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.810
 it's a shooter and people are going to camp yes 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.400
 or yes I do not like it very much there are times that 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.980
 situation asks for it but there are people who 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.980
 done systematically by more than 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.560
 what you want to avoid is impossible because 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.650
 this is a shooter and people are there 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.630
 very campera people then I know what was 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.790
 the error that for example they corrected in 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.830
 the past that they have corrected from the past 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.780
 where to say, for example, 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.720
 I remember that I do not know if it was in black ops 2 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.180
 or in critics I do not know what they said that 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.479
 they would do an anti-camper game that they would do 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.860
 some anti-country maps that not only 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.360
 they wanted and they the moment that 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.220
 they were saying is not the time that 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.919
 they were getting it they were doing that 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.960
 I'm leaving because I'm descojono because no no 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.460
 does not have football sense aesthetic game 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.520
 that we had it on the roof does not have 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.710
 no sense no then what is that is 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.289
 what they have done well now good now 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.330
 basically they have done well one thing that 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.160
 is that the subject of the exoskeleton with this 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.080
 new mobility that you can go for all 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.870
 sides up and down can 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 get to be a tad easier 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.150
 catch the campers or evade the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.880
 campers do not make a maneuver 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.479
 quick evasion to try to get out of 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.889
 the faults of the camper or the bastard do not 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.630
 good is also true that give them 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.040
 more space to camp because now 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.330
 with the tall doubles then they went up 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.810
 the roofs and you're in the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.060
 camperos roof but good I think that 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.040
 the subject of the exoskeleton must see 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.480
 how it evolves because this is just one 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.770
 first impression on everything I'm 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.150
 saying is a first impression what 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.490
 first that I thought and how to play 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.860
 I thought it was fun 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.110
 I say it is graphically nothing special 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.870
 world at the sound level is nothing 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.180
 another world has improved in the section 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.820
 graphic referring to the last color 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.710
 beauty was not hard to say it but 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.620
 yes it is true that eye the drop itself yes is 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.320
 true that good that is the truth not 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.970
 I know I think I think it's pretty good that 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.710
 you're funny that's what you're going to 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.080
 ask a beauty color that is 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.910
 fun to a battle film I do not know if 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.920
 we will be fair or just other types of 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.180
 shooters like we're asking for something more 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.560
 we are not asking for it to be graphically 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.360
 spectacular realist I do not know that it is not 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.580
 well mark this is a case to a game 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.290
 casual tickets you play 10 minutes 20 a 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.070
 whatever it is but they are departures 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.190
 fast 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.560
 what are you going to and point 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.990
 and do not look for more income good the truth 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.800
 is that the game has been good or are 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.780
 totally mind-blowing not if to these 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.710
 heights there is someone who is doubting that 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.540
 be me 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.850
 I understand it perfectly and to me 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.980
 they teach this part of three days ago and 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.050
 I do not believe it and they tell me a week ago 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.240
 I really like the new school 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.770
 my first impression has been good and 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.870
 I really have not believed it but good 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.570
 you guys have to have the heart 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.650
 and the open mind that's just the rest 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.450
 you close it because good I do not know what new 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.250
 call of duty has improved be better than 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.080
 the others are not and it seems that there are people 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.810
 that just as fucking not to be happy 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.210
 pussy that more offer no more offer of 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.940
 leisure and good 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.220
 everything is better for us in 62 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.830
 like a great game together with valero 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.139
 there doing doing the two stand a 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.030
 new another all the one and nothing my 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.500
 call of duty impressions have been 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.449
 I hope you liked it and if 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.370
 you want more videos and you do not have more 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:45.800
 what to say I will try to bring what 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:48.620
 that you like the ear pig far 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.690
 those are big words a hug 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.690
 huge and see you and see you soon
