00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
okay here is a red cat 500 class Cessna

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.520 
okay here is a red cat 500 class Cessna
and<00:00:07.910> people<00:00:08.910> wanted<00:00:09.180> to<00:00:09.210> see<00:00:09.570> how<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:09.900> will<00:00:10.230> fly

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and people wanted to see how it will fly

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.760 
and people wanted to see how it will fly
while<00:00:10.889> flags<00:00:11.400> are<00:00:11.640> down<00:00:11.850> or<00:00:12.480> flaps<00:00:12.840> are<00:00:13.050> up<00:00:13.200> so

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
while flags are down or flaps are up so

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.080 
while flags are down or flaps are up so
here<00:00:14.430> it<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.810> angle<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.379> flex

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
here it is you can see the angle of flex

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.600 
here it is you can see the angle of flex
going<00:00:18.090> down<00:00:20.510> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> angle<00:00:22.110> of<00:00:22.200> flaps<00:00:22.610> so

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
going down this is the angle of flaps so

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.029 
going down this is the angle of flaps so
we<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:24.690> take<00:00:24.930> off<00:00:25.110> with<00:00:25.320> flaps<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:25.860> about

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
we will take off with flaps how about

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.529 
we will take off with flaps how about
that<00:00:26.250> okay<00:00:26.750> I'll<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.020> flaps<00:00:28.320> down<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
that okay I'll put the flaps down and

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
that okay I'll put the flaps down and
try<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.600> take<00:00:30.869> off<00:00:31.020> with<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.440> flaps<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.980> then

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
try to take off with the flaps and then

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:49.170 
try to take off with the flaps and then
we<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.239> put<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> flaps<00:00:34.379> down<00:00:34.500> fly<00:00:34.980> around

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.010 

smooth<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:50.570> sucked<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:52.330> bit<00:00:53.330> of<00:00:53.450> power<00:00:53.720> needed

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
smooth but sucked a bit of power needed

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.960 
smooth but sucked a bit of power needed
when<00:00:54.380> flaps<00:00:54.739> were<00:00:54.950> down<00:01:00.280> why<00:01:01.280> it's<00:01:01.460> flying<00:01:01.730> so

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
when flaps were down why it's flying so

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.890 
when flaps were down why it's flying so
faster

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.890 

okay<00:01:07.620> so<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.130> gonna<00:01:08.310> turn<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.240> put

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
okay so I'm gonna turn around and put

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.600 
okay so I'm gonna turn around and put

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the flaps down and give it a pass okay

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:25.030 
the flaps down and give it a pass okay
I<00:01:18.260> hope<00:01:19.260> I'm<00:01:19.440> not<00:01:19.620> in<00:01:19.800> your<00:01:19.950> way<00:01:20.010> am<00:01:20.850> i<00:01:21.000> hmm<00:01:23.510> okay

yeah<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.520> pretty<00:01:38.700> smooth<00:01:39.120> at<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.360> moment<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
yeah it's pretty smooth at the moment it

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:51.740 
yeah it's pretty smooth at the moment it
climbs<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.330> bit<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.840> tiny<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:50.630> am<00:01:51.630> i

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
climbs up a little bit a tiny bit am i

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.200 
climbs up a little bit a tiny bit am i
flying<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.260> like<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.440> helicopter<00:01:52.680> today<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210 

think<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.510> have<00:02:01.140> flown<00:02:01.440> them<00:02:01.770> too<00:02:02.040> many

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
think I have flown them too many

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.900 
think I have flown them too many
helicopters<00:02:02.430> these<00:02:03.060> days<00:02:07.400> one<00:02:08.400> thing<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.760> will

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
helicopters these days one thing I will

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.170 
helicopters these days one thing I will
recommend<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.920> always<00:02:10.920> keep<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> speed<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.940> on

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
recommend is always keep the speed up on

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.500 
recommend is always keep the speed up on
this<00:02:12.390> Cessna<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.650> cannot<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.510> completely

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
this Cessna you cannot just completely

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.220 
this Cessna you cannot just completely
cut<00:02:15.960> down<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.320> throttle<00:02:17.780> unless<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.020> want<00:02:19.170> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
cut down the throttle unless you want to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.150 
cut down the throttle unless you want to
glide<00:02:20.270> okay<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.510> give<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.440> good<00:02:22.590> angle<00:02:23.040> if

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
glide okay and give it a good angle if

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.560 
glide okay and give it a good angle if
you<00:02:23.250> want<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.460> glide<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.300> should<00:02:24.450> have

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
you want to glide and you should have

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.110 
you want to glide and you should have
more<00:02:24.630> winds<00:02:25.110> actually<00:02:25.680> otherwise<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.970> bird

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
more winds actually otherwise the bird

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.910 
more winds actually otherwise the bird
comes<00:02:27.390> down<00:02:27.630> because<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.440> little<00:02:28.740> bit

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
comes down because it's a little bit

00:02:28.920 --> 00:03:21.130 
comes down because it's a little bit
heavier<00:02:29.280> than<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.760> ordinary<00:02:30.000> Cessnas

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.690 

putting<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.230> flaps<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.159> bringing<00:03:23.580> it

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
putting the flaps down and bringing it

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:37.480 
putting the flaps down and bringing it
for<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.090> landing<00:03:24.480> okay

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:46.460 

that<00:03:38.490> was<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:39.000> fast<00:03:39.570> landing<00:03:40.200> man<00:03:44.690> okay<00:03:45.690> well

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that was a fast landing man okay well

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.920 
that was a fast landing man okay well
that<00:03:46.770> was<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.950> fast<00:03:47.280> landing<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.420> did<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
that was a fast landing and I did it

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.780 
that was a fast landing and I did it
because<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.740> don't<00:03:49.830> have<00:03:50.040> much<00:03:50.250> wind<00:03:50.490> so<00:03:50.730> I

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
because we don't have much wind so I

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.660 
because we don't have much wind so I
cannot<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.750> know<00:03:51.870> ride<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.440> rel<00:03:52.680> down<00:03:53.010> so

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
cannot just you know ride it rel down so

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.420 
cannot just you know ride it rel down so
it<00:03:53.790> needs<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.210> little<00:03:54.480> bit<00:03:54.600> throttle

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.360
