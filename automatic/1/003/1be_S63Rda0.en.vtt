symbols<00:00:00.480> got<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.659> good<00:00:00.930> dynamic<00:00:01.170> range<00:00:01.709> i<00:00:01.979> think

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
symbols got a good dynamic range i think

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.120 
symbols got a good dynamic range i think
they<00:00:02.669> got<00:00:02.850> nice<00:00:03.090> sound<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.570> belz<00:00:03.890> so<00:00:04.890> you're

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
they got nice sound in belz so you're

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.470 
they got nice sound in belz so you're
you're<00:00:05.460> giving<00:00:05.790> yourself<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.240> lot<00:00:06.450> of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
you're giving yourself a lot of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.660 
you're giving yourself a lot of
different<00:00:06.870> sounds<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.980> lot<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.220> different

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
different sounds and a lot of different

00:00:08.670 --> 00:01:50.370 
different sounds and a lot of different
dynamics

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.760 

the<00:01:51.380> idea<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:52.869> putting<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.990> heavier<00:01:54.259> high<00:01:54.530> hat

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the idea of putting a heavier high hat

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.400 
the idea of putting a heavier high hat
on<00:01:54.920> top<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.490> lighter<00:01:55.700> one<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> bottom

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
on top and the lighter one on the bottom

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.169

it<00:01:57.410> just<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:58.130> know<00:01:58.160> I<00:01:58.280> was<00:01:58.640> doing<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:59.000> lot<00:01:59.119> of

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
it just you know I was doing a lot of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.650 
it just you know I was doing a lot of
recording<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.890> got<00:02:01.640> confident<00:02:02.360> enough<00:02:02.600> to

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
recording and I got confident enough to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.330 
recording and I got confident enough to
not<00:02:02.960> be<00:02:03.110> afraid<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.440> try<00:02:03.800> different<00:02:03.950> things

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
not be afraid to try different things

what I look for out of the hats is a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.340 
what I look for out of the hats is a
good<00:02:08.209> response<00:02:08.630> when<00:02:08.840> I'm<00:02:08.929> playing<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.229> with

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
good response when I'm playing it with

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.810 
good response when I'm playing it with
the<00:02:09.440> foot<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> good<00:02:09.920> chick<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.640> way<00:02:10.789> I

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
like not only the sound but the way it

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.470 
like not only the sound but the way it
feels<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:15.500> doesn't<00:02:15.860> feel<00:02:16.070> hard<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.390> know

it feels like I I mean I can't explain
it<00:02:20.750> feels<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.080> your<00:02:21.260> foot<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.769> in<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
it feels like your foot can be in the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.520 
it feels like your foot can be in the
symbol<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:23.360> can<00:02:23.510> sort<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.870> control<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
symbol you can sort of control the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.850 
symbol you can sort of control the
dynamic<00:02:25.190> even<00:02:25.459> with<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> foot<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:29.860> then

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
dynamic even with the foot and and then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.569 
dynamic even with the foot and and then
just<00:02:31.250> some<00:02:31.489> being<00:02:32.269> able<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.720> hear<00:02:33.579> definition

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
just some being able to hear definition

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.330 
just some being able to hear definition
on<00:02:34.730> top<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:38.200> when<00:02:39.200> I'm<00:02:39.320> playing<00:02:39.470> on<00:02:39.769> top<00:02:40.010> if<00:02:40.220> i

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
press down with the foot it gets clearer

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.100 
press down with the foot it gets clearer

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
if I open it up it washes out a little

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.110 
if I open it up it washes out a little
bit<00:02:45.290> more<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.829> I'm<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:47.150> looking<00:02:47.480> for<00:02:47.840> a

bit more and I'm just looking for a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.250 
bit more and I'm just looking for a
dynamic<00:02:50.120> range<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.660> Hyatts<00:02:54.019> either

dynamic range in the Hyatts either

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.990 
dynamic range in the Hyatts either
playing<00:02:54.680> with<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.950> foot<00:02:55.220> or<00:02:55.430> playing<00:02:55.760> with

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
get the same dynamic range with the foot

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.330 
get the same dynamic range with the foot
end<00:04:04.010> with<00:04:04.129> the<00:04:04.280> hands<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.739> developing

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
these high hats it's not just a sound

that we're trying to get out of these

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.250 
that we're trying to get out of these
symbols<00:04:12.500> it's<00:04:13.159> like<00:04:13.459> a<00:04:13.669> whole<00:04:14.090> dynamic<00:04:14.900> range

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
symbols it's like a whole dynamic range

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.949 
symbols it's like a whole dynamic range
of<00:04:16.359> from<00:04:17.359> loud<00:04:17.630> too<00:04:17.900> soft<00:04:18.199> from<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.099> chick<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.459> a

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
of from loud too soft from a chick to a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.520 
of from loud too soft from a chick to a
king<00:04:20.959> when<00:04:21.460> when<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:22.580> with<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.000> foot<00:04:23.530> from

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
king when when you with the foot from

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.760 
king when when you with the foot from
almost<00:04:25.460> like<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:25.900> tight<00:04:29.050> closed<00:04:30.050> hi-hat<00:04:30.349> sound

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
almost like a tight closed hi-hat sound

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.450 
almost like a tight closed hi-hat sound
too<00:04:31.070> maybe<00:04:31.669> even<00:04:31.940> like<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:33.009> funky<00:04:34.009> sounding

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
too maybe even like a funky sounding

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.219 
too maybe even like a funky sounding
ride<00:04:34.789> if<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.300> play<00:04:35.509> it<00:04:35.539> and<00:04:35.810> loosen<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.349> up

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
ride if you play it and loosen it up

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.089 
ride if you play it and loosen it up
that's<00:04:39.229> what<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.409> could<00:04:39.620> get<00:04:39.740> with<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.949> old

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
that's what I could get with the old

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.129 
that's what I could get with the old
ones<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.520> that's<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.180> only<00:04:41.330> thing<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.599> can<00:04:41.659> ask

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
ones and that's the only thing I can ask

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.960 
ones and that's the only thing I can ask
them<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.680> try<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.070> deal<00:04:43.190> with<00:04:43.340> these<00:04:43.460> new<00:04:43.699> ones

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
them to try and deal with these new ones

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.500 
them to try and deal with these new ones
I<00:04:44.210> think<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.840> k<00:04:45.050> custom<00:04:45.729> session<00:04:46.729> series<00:04:47.180> is

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
I think the k custom session series is

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.000 
I think the k custom session series is
is<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.500> great<00:04:48.860> series<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:51.169> know<00:04:51.289> there's

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
is a great series and you know there's

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.379 
is a great series and you know there's
something<00:04:52.250> great<00:04:52.610> now<00:04:52.909> and<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.849> as<00:04:55.849> with

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
something great now and and and as with

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.939 
something great now and and and as with
everything<00:04:56.630> else<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:57.020> zildjian<00:04:57.500> does<00:04:57.710> this

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
everything else that zildjian does this

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.500 
everything else that zildjian does this
stuff<00:04:58.130> just<00:04:58.370> keeps<00:04:58.550> on<00:04:58.760> getting<00:04:58.940> better<00:04:59.240> and

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
stuff just keeps on getting better and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.439 
stuff just keeps on getting better and
better<00:04:59.659> they're<00:05:00.320> very<00:05:00.889> dynamic<00:05:01.669> they<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:02.090> like

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
better they're very dynamic they I like

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.339 
better they're very dynamic they I like
the<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:03.680> tone<00:05:03.949> areas<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.669> they're<00:05:04.849> in<00:05:05.060> I

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
the the tone areas that they're in I

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.020 
the the tone areas that they're in I
think<00:05:06.349> the<00:05:06.440> tone<00:05:06.650> areas<00:05:07.070> record<00:05:07.580> good<00:05:07.820> the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
think the tone areas record good the

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.450 
think the tone areas record good the
crashes<00:05:08.479> respond<00:05:08.990> fast<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:11.570> hi<00:05:12.470> hats<00:05:12.770> are<00:05:13.009> you

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
crashes respond fast the hi hats are you

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.659 
crashes respond fast the hi hats are you
get<00:05:13.759> definition<00:05:14.449> and<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.960> plus<00:05:15.889> you<00:05:16.130> can<00:05:16.340> get

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
get definition and and plus you can get

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.460 
get definition and and plus you can get
almost<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.210> ride<00:05:17.449> sound<00:05:17.900> with<00:05:18.110> them<00:05:18.229> they<00:05:18.289> get<00:05:18.409> a

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
almost a ride sound with them they get a

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.310 
almost a ride sound with them they get a
good<00:05:18.680> chick<00:05:19.039> you've<00:05:19.940> got<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.120> lot<00:05:20.360> of<00:05:20.389> you<00:05:21.199> know

good chick you've got a lot of you know

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.480 
good chick you've got a lot of you know
there's<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.560> lot<00:05:21.590> of<00:05:21.800> things<00:05:22.039> you<00:05:22.099> can<00:05:22.220> do<00:05:22.370> with

there's a lot of things you can do with

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.150 
there's a lot of things you can do with
