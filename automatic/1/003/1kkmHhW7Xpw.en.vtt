00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.549
 Hello, yours, and today we are going to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.549
 decorate an agenda with wasit 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:20.540
 for this we need an agenda and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.540
 rice paper tape or washi tape 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.440
 this is the admiration we are going to 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.440
 use on this occasion 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.530
 bye 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.949
 we'll start by placing the first strips and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.620
 we will make sure that it is left 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:42.519
 no wrinkle running your finger through 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.090
 Once placed, we will cut the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.090
 surplus 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500
 goodbye 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.810
 today 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.059
 we put the second tape and we will go 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.460
 placing the rest until completing the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.460
 two tapas leaving the tenderloin to the end 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.240
 Y 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.260
 we will finish the agenda by applying the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.470
 tape in the middle of the spine so that 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.040
 Excel for both covers and cut 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.040
 again 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 and we'll go over the edges cutting all 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.880
 the tape that we have left 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.810
 to give the original touch to our 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 agenda we can beautify by applying it 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.510
 a close with her milk colors and a 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.700
 piece of rope for this we will use 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.510
 the propagates that will serve us for 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.580
 Drill and fix the eye led to the lid 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.550
 We can choose two different sizes of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 hole and there are several heads according to 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.100
 eye led we want to use as well as 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.120
 a side guide to mark the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.120
 hole depth 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.680
 we introduce in the gillette that we have 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.970
 chosen inside the hole and we fix it 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.970
 with the air troop 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.090
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.110
 then we will take our rope and the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.940
 we will go through the hole 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.629
 making the necessary knots so that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.629
 do not escape 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.090
 to finish we wind the rope 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.090
 several laps and tied with a bow 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.340
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.890
