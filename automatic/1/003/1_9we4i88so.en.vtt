more into trance starting off with the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.680 
more into trance starting off with the
plot<00:01:27.369> which<00:01:27.850> I<00:01:28.030> thought<00:01:28.330> was<00:01:28.479> interesting

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
plot which I thought was interesting

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.810 
plot which I thought was interesting
like<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.260> said<00:01:29.500> hypnotism<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.280> think<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.670> very

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
like I said hypnotism I think is very

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.200 
like I said hypnotism I think is very
interesting<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:31.539> can<00:01:32.109> really<00:01:32.500> be<00:01:32.859> a<00:01:33.700> cool

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
interesting and can really be a cool

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.149 
interesting and can really be a cool
thing<00:01:34.240> for<00:01:34.539> movies<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.680> think<00:01:35.890> they<00:01:35.979> used

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
thing for movies and I think they used

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.940 
thing for movies and I think they used
it<00:01:36.280> in<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.460> cool<00:01:36.670> way<00:01:36.880> here<00:01:37.329> in<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.259> he<00:01:38.649> needs

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
it in a cool way here in that he needs

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.819 
it in a cool way here in that he needs
to<00:01:39.100> find<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.670> painting<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:41.079> he<00:01:41.409> lost<00:01:41.649> he

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
to find a painting that he lost he

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.289 
to find a painting that he lost he
forgot<00:01:42.159> where<00:01:42.340> he<00:01:42.369> put<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.789> because<00:01:43.119> he<00:01:43.210> got

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
forgot where he put it because he got

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.240 
forgot where he put it because he got
popped<00:01:43.899> in<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:44.259> head<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:44.679> so<00:01:44.890> they<00:01:45.009> try<00:01:45.219> to

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
enjoyed that the only problem is that it

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.090

explanation<00:01:57.789> when<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.270> gets<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:59.109> know<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
explanation when it gets to you know the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.349 
explanation when it gets to you know the
last<00:01:59.560> act<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.520> needs<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.999> just<00:02:01.179> kind<00:02:01.329> of

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
last act it needs to just kind of

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.270 
last act it needs to just kind of
backtrack<00:02:01.929> so<00:02:02.200> much<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.560> explain<00:02:02.950> things<00:02:03.159> to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
backtrack so much and explain things to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.130 
backtrack so much and explain things to
you<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.759> feel<00:02:03.999> like<00:02:04.060> if<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.539> do<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.899> right

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you and I feel like if you do it right

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.349 
you and I feel like if you do it right
you<00:02:05.710> don't<00:02:05.979> need<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.159> explain<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.670> much<00:02:06.880> we

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
you don't need to explain that much we

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.200 
you don't need to explain that much we
can<00:02:07.570> get<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:08.979> think<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.880> know<00:02:10.000> it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
can get it and so I think you know it

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.970 
can get it and so I think you know it
could<00:02:10.450> have<00:02:10.539> been<00:02:10.720> maybe<00:02:10.899> written<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.530> little

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
could have been maybe written a little

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.430 
could have been maybe written a little
bit<00:02:12.130> tighter<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.480> ending<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.170> so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
bit tighter and with the ending more so

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.320 
bit tighter and with the ending more so
in<00:02:14.650> mind<00:02:14.950> throughout<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> movie<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.120> mean

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
in mind throughout the movie I mean

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.700 
in mind throughout the movie I mean
obviously<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.930> ending<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.380> mind<00:02:17.560> when

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
obviously the ending is in mind when

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.770 
obviously the ending is in mind when
you're<00:02:17.830> writing<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.100> rest<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.460> but<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:19.360> just

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you're writing the rest of it but I just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.420 
you're writing the rest of it but I just
feel<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.110> wish<00:02:20.410> they<00:02:20.530> went<00:02:20.710> back<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.160> sort

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
feel like I wish they went back and sort

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.610 
feel like I wish they went back and sort
of<00:02:21.490> made<00:02:21.790> things<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.210> little<00:02:22.390> bit<00:02:22.630> clearer<00:02:23.080> so

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
of made things a little bit clearer so

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.770 
of made things a little bit clearer so
it<00:02:23.770> didn't<00:02:23.980> require<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.819> much<00:02:25.090> explanation

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
it didn't require so much explanation

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.080 
it didn't require so much explanation
because<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.200> lot<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.890> explanation<00:02:27.880> at<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
because it's a lot of explanation at the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.820 
because it's a lot of explanation at the
end<00:02:28.240> but<00:02:28.540> probably<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.050> best<00:02:29.230> aspect<00:02:29.710> of

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
end but probably the best aspect of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.540 
end but probably the best aspect of
trance<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.670> visuals<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.110> movie<00:02:32.550> how

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
trance is the visuals of the movie how

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.220 
trance is the visuals of the movie how
holy

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
holy

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.750 
holy
it's<00:02:35.530> exactly<00:02:36.159> what<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.340> looks<00:02:36.489> like<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
it's exactly what it looks like in the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's exactly what it looks like in the
trailer<00:02:36.879> honestly<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.690> maybe<00:02:37.900> even<00:02:38.230> more<00:02:38.379> I

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
trailer honestly and maybe even more I

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.870 
trailer honestly and maybe even more I
really<00:02:39.010> loved<00:02:39.280> how<00:02:39.580> they

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
really loved how they

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.210 
really loved how they
the<00:02:40.420> hypnotism<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.200> whenever<00:02:41.770> someone<00:02:42.040> was

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the hypnotism and whenever someone was

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.770 
the hypnotism and whenever someone was
hypnotized<00:02:42.610> what<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.000> looked<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.360> what<00:02:43.690> it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
hypnotized what it looked like what it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.810 
hypnotized what it looked like what it
felt<00:02:44.050> like<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.560> tone<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.220> really

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
felt like the tone of it I really

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.040 
felt like the tone of it I really
thought<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.000> was<00:02:46.210> awesome<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.750> thought<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
thought that was awesome I thought the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.870 
thought that was awesome I thought the
editing<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.800> movie<00:02:48.010> was<00:02:48.130> great<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.490> well

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
editing of the movie was great as well

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.910 
editing of the movie was great as well
I<00:02:48.910> have<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.360> say<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.900> thought<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> intro

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
I have to say that I thought the intro

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.160 
I have to say that I thought the intro
before<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:51.970> actually<00:02:52.090> says<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> title

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
before it actually says like the title

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.440 
before it actually says like the title
of<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> movie<00:02:53.490> was<00:02:54.490> freakin<00:02:54.880> awesome<00:02:55.000> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
of the movie was freakin awesome and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.690 
of the movie was freakin awesome and
made<00:02:55.990> even<00:02:56.110> more<00:02:56.380> awesome<00:02:56.530> when<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.460> said<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
made even more awesome when it said the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.070 
made even more awesome when it said the
title<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.120> movie<00:02:58.300> because<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.540> assumed<00:02:59.020> it

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
title of the movie because I assumed it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.940 
title of the movie because I assumed it
was<00:02:59.110> one<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.350> those<00:02:59.440> things<00:02:59.620> where<00:02:59.740> they<00:02:59.800> just

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
was one of those things where they just

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.140 
was one of those things where they just
don't<00:03:00.100> show<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> title<00:03:00.490> which<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.820> whatever

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
don't show the title which is whatever

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.700 
don't show the title which is whatever
but<00:03:01.780> when<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.960> showed<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> title<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.500> was<00:03:02.590> like

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
but when it showed the title I was like

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.500 
but when it showed the title I was like
that<00:03:02.950> was<00:03:03.070> just<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.370> intro<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:04.030> was<00:03:04.150> freakin

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that was just the intro that was freakin

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.120 
that was just the intro that was freakin
awesome<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.110> there<00:03:05.350> was<00:03:05.470> also<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.800> scene<00:03:06.070> I

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
awesome and there was also a scene I

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.380 
awesome and there was also a scene I
want<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.340> specifically<00:03:06.700> mention<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.240> course

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
want to specifically mention of course

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.000 
want to specifically mention of course
not<00:03:07.600> giving<00:03:07.810> anything<00:03:07.960> away<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.800> middle

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
not giving anything away in the middle

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.250 
not giving anything away in the middle
of<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.190> movie<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:09.790> long<00:03:10.120> well<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.050> guess

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
of the movie it's this long well I guess

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.110 
of the movie it's this long well I guess
it's<00:03:11.380> not<00:03:11.470> long<00:03:11.770> long<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.400> went<00:03:12.670> on<00:03:12.850> for<00:03:13.090> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
it's not long long but it went on for a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.780 
it's not long long but it went on for a
while<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:13.870> hypnotism<00:03:14.170> scene<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:15.400> guess<00:03:15.640> I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
while this hypnotism scene and I guess I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.910 
while this hypnotism scene and I guess I
can't<00:03:16.270> say<00:03:16.600> specifically<00:03:17.110> what<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.470> was<00:03:17.680> but

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
can't say specifically what it was but

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.020 
can't say specifically what it was but
hopefully<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.400> know<00:03:18.550> what<00:03:18.640> I'm<00:03:18.730> talking

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
hopefully you know what I'm talking

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.490 
hopefully you know what I'm talking
about<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.240> you've<00:03:19.360> seen<00:03:19.570> trance<00:03:19.900> already<00:03:20.290> I

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
about if you've seen trance already I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.890 
about if you've seen trance already I
was<00:03:21.280> blown<00:03:21.760> away<00:03:21.910> my<00:03:22.090> jaw<00:03:22.360> was<00:03:22.510> dropped<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
thought was fantastic especially in a

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.450 
thought was fantastic especially in a
scene<00:03:32.260> where<00:03:32.440> there<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:32.800> mic<00:03:33.040> hidden<00:03:33.370> on

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
scene where there is a mic hidden on

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.130 
scene where there is a mic hidden on
somebody<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.210> hear<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> audio<00:03:34.690> from<00:03:34.990> the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
somebody and you hear the audio from the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.260 
somebody and you hear the audio from the
mic<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.590> actually<00:03:35.860> wish<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.550> had<00:03:37.120> gone

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
mic I actually wish that that had gone

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.910 
mic I actually wish that that had gone
on<00:03:37.330> for<00:03:37.630> longer<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.990> wish<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.380> didn't<00:03:38.590> cut<00:03:38.740> back

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
on for longer I wish it didn't cut back

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.820 
on for longer I wish it didn't cut back
and<00:03:39.100> forth<00:03:39.340> from<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.970> mic<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.900> regular<00:03:41.440> audio

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830
