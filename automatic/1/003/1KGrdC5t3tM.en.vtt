00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.660
 they are all boys welcome back to this 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.390
 new video 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.860
 here I am very tired, it's fine though 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.800
 decided however to do at least 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.840
 the unboxing of the device to send 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.259
 I will give her impressions tomorrow in short 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.509
 within a few days 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:23.779
 of what and perhaps the pluses 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.929
 oh god to go on 6 plus 64 giga 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.489
 unfortunately or maybe not silver because it is 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.099
 pretty much it was to take the space 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:34.640
 gray but they sold it like nothing 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.489
 meaning that they started as nothing for 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.609
 which remained simply or 64gb silver 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.239
 and since I wanted 64 GB anyway 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.629
 I took the silver model then entering 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.719
 in the store and seeing the sidereal gray 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.359
 indeed perhaps the silver is the way 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.199
 half of gold that honestly doesn't 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.210
 I like it alot 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.449
 while silver is what it is 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.570
 maybe they mix the bands a little more with 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:07.790
 the gray color sum this year perhaps 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.420
 really seeing the space I like 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 almost anyway the silver goes well 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 in short, there was only this Pope 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.079
 I will sell I will take 47 I do not know see 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.710
 an experiment I'm doing in the sense 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.880
 who has an experiment I wanted to buy a 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.979
 I was waiting for an iphone with grace 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.790
 bigger screen 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.680
 let's say it 's then satisfied me 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.320
 like so many other people who run and 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.600
 so I decided to do so 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.549
 I take this thing if I don't 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.180
 I find this size reselling it for 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.600
 we 47 believe i 'll be sure to a 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.049
 level for conomico handle e 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.689
 anything else better for which 64 giga 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.009
 silver new to do unboxing logically 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.200
 I've already opened the shopping bag you have 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.329
 please have some problems with 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.250
 manufacture or things like that has the 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.930
 phone is really really nice 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.509
 the only thing that worries me as well 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.750
 as you can see the bands are not very noticeable 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.369
 say on the silver model 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.709
 the only thing that worries me is that a 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.000
 little the boat effect and the camera 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.180
 which is quite protruding 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.830
 song I already know that I'll see if it is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 see you see 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.190
 I already know that I will take one of those covers 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.320
 which eventually cover this step e 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.760
 present will be all a single block with 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.730
 the back side 7.1 mm the weight 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.130
 that about 175 grams now not 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.709
 I remember but honestly I thought worse 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.870
 the worst in size is difficult 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.209
 actually challenging it because it is a 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.489
 phone that is big enough 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.620
 the only thing would be a little easier 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.110
 use or better ignition of the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.320
 lock release and lock release if the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.260
 button maybe placed at least half the screen 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.420
 because as you actually see I have to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.980
 do this movement every time for 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.170
 turning on is not exactly the most comfortable 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.160
 however also at its own level 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.270
 frames here at the end this part comes 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.040
 with we know what is now less popular 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.489
 between ends and sensors and then they are all here 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.340
 over it 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.090
 anyway I at the level of frames have 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.420
 optimized a little better though 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.879
 I must say that it did n't hurt us 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.910
 the shape of the telephone in material is 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.640
 really a nice phone that is not 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.700
 immediately notice that he is holding a 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.650
 nice phone 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.430
 I repeat the weight is not sincerely done 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.930
 I thought worse 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.200
 as size my first phone a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.330
 55 inches I repeat 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.250
 let's see how I find mine 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.420
 impressions from people who came by 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.709
 a 4 I tried a 4 3 is a 47 but never 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.110
 a 5 5 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.110
 therefore they will be impressions of the whole 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:07.180
 subjective we remove the plastic as vi 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:10.360
 I said precisely that I am a bit of a profile 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.280
 here almost curves on a very rounded 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.650
 very very nice 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.019
 honestly this kind of design likes it 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.320
 much to that of the sandwiches rather than 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.570
 that of the player so very very nice 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.580
 does not hold it in hand 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.160
 however you slip that much 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.729
 I'll put a cover on the fact of the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.669
 camera and it will not scratch I 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.750
 understood that he only scratches himself looking at it 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.580
 do not exceed log in any more 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.289
 features only a boxing with 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.190
 he will show you the four corners 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.289
 do not touch each other 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.099
 you will see that this is one of the most difficult 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.870
 neighbors 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.729
 however do not touch unless 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.500
 start the phone in meters 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.430
 strange positions clearly then to the 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.630
 risk and danger 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.690
 something I noticed instead 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.430
 interesting writing two hands 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.760
 this is really a very very thing 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.160
 interesting because you really succeed 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:09.550
 to write well and hold the phone is 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.800
 a correct position very truth 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.110
 very very nice it seems to write 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.450
 on the ipad mini keyboard really 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.889
 really beautiful common thing is nothing or 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.200
 then you can put them with a little bit 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.810
 for wide you and anything else but this one 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.720
 we will see then in the coming days here vi 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.789
 I will also be able to say how I feel like 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.969
 see here in the box 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.669
 there is the 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:34.099
 run plastic in short there is the spawn the 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.969
 hole for the camera in here okay 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.529
 slice gr sticker and here matrica usb 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.079
 surgically if used for 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.419
 connect it itunes and take me back up e 

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:46.369
 nothing guys said this the cable was 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.009
 the classic one meter lightning not the 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:50.989
 request I show some more 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.249
 really really nice detail on 

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:58.519
 constructive level is very impeccable 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.139
 very very nice ie when you take in 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:02.899
 hand this phone the first thing that 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.459
 says it's cabbage the materials we leave 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:05.719
 lose the screen as an end one 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:08.809
 subjective based on usage 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:12.379
 however the end the materials and the quality 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:14.539
 see it see the care in the constructive 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:16.639
 details are very very well I have to say 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.919
 that the silver 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.509
 honestly I thought the bands were worse 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:26.239
 they see little I must say that I like it 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.610
 we say that in bad luck maybe I have 

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:30.110
 found a color this year is me 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.929
 like a little bit more because black 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.449
 behind and just all dark gray not 

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:37.849
 it's like the 55 if that is worth bands anyway 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.439
 in black glass and then peeled off a little 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.759
 of sidereal help than a color 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.259
 quite dark 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.539
 then of course they are tastes and God forbid 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:47.160
 blog sean penn silva I don't mind 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:51.190
 the only thing with sun 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.840
 it was the only one from 64 a high voice anyway 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.310
 now I'll try in the next few days 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.100
 several videos will come clearly 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.720
 camera and everything else and nothing at all 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.040
 this interrupts us are boys videos 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.040
 greetings to all bye bye
