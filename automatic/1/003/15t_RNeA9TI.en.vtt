00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:08.320
 functions of the mountains in one of the ayahs of the Quran 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.260
 highlights the extremely important 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:17.619
 the biological function of the mountains in the structure 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:21.130
 lands this 31 ayah 21 sura we erected on 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.520
 Earth unshakable mountains in order for it 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.840
 didn't hesitate we laid on her 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.369
 wide roads 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.840
 so they follow the right path 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.539
 it turned out that the mountains are not only 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.989
 only my elevations on the surface of the earth 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:43.469
 inside the earth the rock of waste there is also 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:46.600
 roots and they are roots sometimes 10 15 times 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.940
 exceed their own mountain height above 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.129
 ground surface 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.320
 thanks to this particular mountain 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.050
 liken yours or nail 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.350
 which firmly hold the plates of the earth's crust 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.420
 like boards bonded to each other 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.009
 nails for example the roots of Mount Everest 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.649
 reaching 9 thousand meters above 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.409
 surface of the earth extend into her 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.399
 bowels of more than one hundred twenty five 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.810
 thousand meters 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.820
 the mountains and the roots of the mountains result from 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.020
 collisions of large plates 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.390
 crust 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.270
 then at the time of the collision of two such 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.119
 layers of more durable ones are located 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.579
 under another layer turned out to be 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.159
 surface gradually folding 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.070
 form folds which lead to 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.960
 the formation of mountains and hills what 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.899
 touches the bottom of the two encountered 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.689
 layers then it keeps moving under 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.609
 earth leads to the emergence of deep 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.490
 branches which are actually and 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.130
 become the roots of the mountains 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.740
 in one of the Koran ayahs also reported 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.649
 about this function of the mountains and to describe 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.049
 the words of the mountain are exactly the words used 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:05.229
 his speech is about the sixth and seventh verses 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.780
 78 sura did we not make the earth lie 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.780
 and the mountains piled
