bed looking at the night sky and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.339 
bed looking at the night sky and
sometimes<00:00:20.450> we<00:00:20.660> like<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.869> look<00:00:21.080> up<00:00:21.170> at<00:00:21.290> the

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
sometimes we like to look up at the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.920 
sometimes we like to look up at the
stars<00:00:21.410> and<00:00:22.189> make<00:00:22.460> up<00:00:22.640> funny<00:00:23.000> stories<00:00:23.660> about

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
stars and make up funny stories about

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.720 
stars and make up funny stories about
the<00:00:24.349> things<00:00:24.380> that<00:00:24.590> we<00:00:24.770> see<00:00:24.980> have<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:25.550> ever

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
looked up at the clouds during the day

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.570 
looked up at the clouds during the day
and<00:00:27.439> thought<00:00:27.590> about<00:00:27.619> what<00:00:27.890> they<00:00:28.160> looked<00:00:28.490> like

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
and thought about what they looked like

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.269 
and thought about what they looked like
a<00:00:28.970> duck<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:29.570> alligator<00:00:30.230> a<00:00:30.289> shark<00:00:30.650> or<00:00:30.830> even<00:00:30.949> a

a duck and alligator a shark or even a
bear<00:00:31.550> well<00:00:32.000> people<00:00:32.390> do<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.689> same<00:00:32.720> thing<00:00:33.170> with

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
bear well people do the same thing with

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.990 
bear well people do the same thing with
the<00:00:33.440> Stars<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:33.980> they've<00:00:34.220> done<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:34.640> for

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
the Stars and they've done so for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.119 
the Stars and they've done so for
thousands<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.930> years<00:00:36.350> I'm<00:00:36.590> sure<00:00:36.920> you've

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
thousands of years I'm sure you've

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.160 
thousands of years I'm sure you've
noticed<00:00:37.340> on<00:00:37.640> a<00:00:37.670> nice<00:00:37.970> clear<00:00:38.360> night<00:00:38.390> how<00:00:38.960> there

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
noticed on a nice clear night how there

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.100 
noticed on a nice clear night how there
are<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:39.800> many<00:00:40.340> stars<00:00:40.879> in<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.090> sky<00:00:41.180> more<00:00:41.870> than

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
are so many stars in the sky more than

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.959 
are so many stars in the sky more than
you<00:00:42.199> can<00:00:42.320> probably<00:00:42.559> count<00:00:42.949> some<00:00:43.460> stars<00:00:43.730> look

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
you can probably count some stars look

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.580 
you can probably count some stars look
brighter<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.540> us<00:00:44.690> than<00:00:44.840> others<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
brighter to us than others and the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.139 
brighter to us than others and the
darker<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:46.100> is<00:00:46.160> where<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.460> live<00:00:46.670> like<00:00:46.940> if

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
darker it is where you live like if

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.639 
darker it is where you live like if
you're<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.570> far<00:00:47.960> from<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.230> lights<00:00:48.410> of<00:00:48.530> a

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
you're really far from the lights of a

you're really far from the lights of a
city<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:49.370> more<00:00:49.640> stars<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.059> can<00:00:50.300> see<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:50.809> for

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
city the more stars you can see and for

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.479 
city the more stars you can see and for
a<00:00:51.110> long<00:00:51.350> time<00:00:51.620> people<00:00:52.010> have<00:00:52.100> seen<00:00:52.280> pictures

a long time people have seen pictures

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.690 
a long time people have seen pictures
among<00:00:52.969> certain<00:00:53.210> groups<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.600> stars<00:00:53.930> just<00:00:54.170> like

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
among certain groups of stars just like

are sometimes called constellations and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.639 
are sometimes called constellations and
scientists<00:00:59.390> still<00:00:59.660> use<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.170> names<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.530> these

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
scientists still use the names of these

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.500 
scientists still use the names of these
constellations<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:01.610> describe<00:01:01.969> different

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
constellations to describe different

constellations to describe different
parts<00:01:02.809> of<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.320> night<00:01:03.530> sky<00:01:03.890> probably<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.850> most

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
parts of the night sky probably the most

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.510 
parts of the night sky probably the most
famous<00:01:05.720> group<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.289> stars<00:01:06.530> that's<00:01:06.710> easiest<00:01:07.430> to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
famous group of stars that's easiest to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.700 
famous group of stars that's easiest to
find<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.180> Big<00:01:08.479> Dipper<00:01:08.780> if<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.380> live<00:01:09.590> in

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
find is the Big Dipper if you live in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.560 
find is the Big Dipper if you live in
the<00:01:09.800> Northern<00:01:10.220> Hemisphere<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:11.030> can<00:01:11.210> spot<00:01:11.450> it

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the Northern Hemisphere you can spot it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.420 
the Northern Hemisphere you can spot it
pretty<00:01:11.990> easily<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.860> northern<00:01:13.190> part<00:01:13.369> of

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
pretty easily in the northern part of

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.520 
pretty easily in the northern part of
the<00:01:13.490> sky<00:01:13.700> it's<00:01:14.149> made<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.479> seven<00:01:14.930> bright<00:01:15.410> stars

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
the sky it's made of seven bright stars

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.800 
the sky it's made of seven bright stars
and<00:01:16.220> if<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.520> connect<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.210> dots<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.659> those

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
and if you connect the dots of those

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.320 
and if you connect the dots of those
stars<00:01:18.080> you'll<00:01:18.260> see<00:01:18.409> a<00:01:18.439> big<00:01:19.030> squarish<00:01:20.030> bowl

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
stars you'll see a big squarish bowl

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.320 
stars you'll see a big squarish bowl
with<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> really<00:01:21.229> long<00:01:21.799> handle<00:01:22.549> sticking<00:01:23.180> out

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
with a really long handle sticking out

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.270 
with a really long handle sticking out
of<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> United<00:01:24.290> States<00:01:24.590> some<00:01:24.950> people

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
of it in the United States some people

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.980 
of it in the United States some people
thought<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.640> Stars<00:01:25.880> look<00:01:26.060> like<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> big<00:01:26.570> ladle

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
thought the Stars look like a big ladle

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.359 
thought the Stars look like a big ladle
or<00:01:27.110> spoon<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:27.680> they<00:01:27.770> called<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.130> Big

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
or spoon so they called it the Big

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.310 
or spoon so they called it the Big
Dipper<00:01:28.580> but<00:01:29.000> just<00:01:29.360> like<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.570> fluffy<00:01:29.900> clouds

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
Dipper but just like the fluffy clouds

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.289 
Dipper but just like the fluffy clouds
we're<00:01:30.590> talking<00:01:30.950> about<00:01:31.070> groups<00:01:31.729> of<00:01:31.850> stars<00:01:32.000> can

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
we're talking about groups of stars can

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.030 
we're talking about groups of stars can
look<00:01:32.420> different<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.229> different<00:01:33.530> people<00:01:33.890> in

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
look different to different people in

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.399 
look different to different people in
Great<00:01:34.460> Britain<00:01:34.670> for<00:01:35.060> example<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.659> same<00:01:35.960> seven

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
Great Britain for example the same seven

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.679 
Great Britain for example the same seven
stars<00:01:36.830> are<00:01:37.040> called<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.670> plough<00:01:37.970> because<00:01:38.570> they

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
stars are called the plough because they

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.120 
stars are called the plough because they
were<00:01:38.750> thought<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.080> look<00:01:39.259> like<00:01:39.439> a<00:01:39.619> farmer's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
were thought to look like a farmer's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.130 
were thought to look like a farmer's
plough<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.640> people<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.210> Germany<00:01:41.659> thought<00:01:42.020> it

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
plough and people in Germany thought it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.289 
plough and people in Germany thought it
looked<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.619> wagon<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.189> those<00:01:43.490> same<00:01:43.880> stars

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
looked like a wagon and those same stars

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.690

in the sky but in the winter you should

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.580 
in the sky but in the winter you should
look<00:01:59.030> for<00:01:59.210> another<00:01:59.509> famous<00:01:59.810> constellation

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
see another group of stars like he's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.590

something like a shield and what are

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.370 
something like a shield and what are
those<00:02:25.700> fuzzy<00:02:26.030> lights<00:02:26.480> hanging<00:02:26.780> from<00:02:27.050> his<00:02:27.140> belt

kind of looks like a sword there's a lot
more<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.020> Orion<00:02:30.140> than<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.800> few<00:02:31.070> stars

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
more to Orion than just a few stars

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
more to Orion than just a few stars
that's<00:02:31.970> why<00:02:32.210> when<00:02:32.480> astronomers<00:02:32.750> talk<00:02:33.230> about

that's why when astronomers talk about

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.380 
that's why when astronomers talk about

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
few stars that might look like something

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.160 
few stars that might look like something
they<00:02:37.340> also<00:02:37.580> mean<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.630> other<00:02:38.780> stuff<00:02:39.050> in

that part of the night sky so part of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.380 
that part of the night sky so part of
what<00:02:41.120> gives

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
what gives

constellation - so what if you live in
the<00:02:50.030> southern<00:02:50.360> hemisphere<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:51.230> keep<00:02:51.500> your

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the constellations it's still pretty

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.340
