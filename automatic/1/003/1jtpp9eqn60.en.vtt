00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:09.160
 Hello this video specifically 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.580
 intended for those who do not like to eat 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.380
 bony fish is a carp burning on 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.539
 really just need a little bit 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.820
 imagine the structure of this fish and 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.699
 then there will be no problems bones you 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.749
 will not interfere now I will clearly show 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:30.009
 how to disassemble bream to 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:32.399
 the bones did not disturb you now I will remove the skin 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.440
 to make it clearer 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:45.100
 will need to be shown on it to 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:49.510
 on time, still hide the skin 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.590
 look here there are such here 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 knuckles here you can immediately remove them 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.950
 can then in the process 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.880
 such here such here healthy long 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.819
 bone here now look here before the trial 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.030
 we reach the edge to the vertebra night 

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:12.939
 somewhere about a third measure out here 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.509
 such an imaginary line hold here in 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.600
 this meat here from this line to the back 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 there are no bones we can separate it like this 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 and eat these bones from taking away won't interfere 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.179
 this is the meat we separate 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.299
 there is no bone here 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:36.189
 you can just take and eat now 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.619
 Begin to carefully separate the second third 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.689
 But in the second third of the best here 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.490
 The main ones are those very values â€‹â€‹and 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.700
 bones that nobody likes i don't either 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.829
 love we start taking meat with a fork 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.399
 so here is the direction from the head to 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.139
 tail 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.630
 because the bones are exactly like that here 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:56.740
 arranged you see they start 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.749
 appear if some bones with meat 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.479
 we leave them immediately postpone knocking 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:05.310
 in the direction that's just like a fork for 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.470
 it is very convenient to use the plug 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 accordingly, the meat that we shoot in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.580
 there are no other bones in it, only there is 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.630
 here these two here as a bone yet 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.630
 there is no other 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 it sometimes turns out to take off completely without 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 bones sometimes here and so in the process 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:37.090
 bones have to clean here we are 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:38.490
 removed it too ok here bones 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.830
 which remained 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.260
 sticking out of here we run between them 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.410
 someone like gebo them and remove them in a bunch 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.410
 right away 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.890
 accordingly, we are left here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.410
 another third 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.709
 in this third also to the wall we have this whole 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.520
 we eat quite calmly not worried 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.380
 started 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.840
 this is also pure meat tasty that we 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.420
 Similarly , we are following half the back 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.790
 bream we dismantled here and left ribs 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.590
 ribs in the most delicious except the fox 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.350
 no ribs any bones just as well 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.860
 fork they are fine like that 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.880
 way the meat is removed with it if 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.780
 consolidation of the material covered 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:33.340
 repeat on the second side bream means 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.570
 we take a third the meat we separate the bones here 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.790
 no we are going further now we only have 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.730
 we have bones turned over now 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.980
 there is already some other side to hang around 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.220
 so we start neatly here 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.450
 so here to separate 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:59.170
 separates meat at about 45 degrees 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:02.280
 fork from head to tail and always 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.900
 It turns out it is very neat to do 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.780
 those bones that stayed neat 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.470
 here hang around owls between them plug and 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.620
 so bend to the side of the finger remove 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 all this way at once on four 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.669
 five bones are removed from here that 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.990
 left hanging around here now in the rest 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.960
 this piece of meat 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.690
 bones from here, too, no vertebra 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.680
 we separate it and we too 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:37.270
 Ate well, and the ribs on the stub most 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:43.060
 delicious here so fork separated so 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.789
 meat from the ribs and there of course except 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.180
 rows of no other bones are pleasant 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.180
 appetite
