00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:19.809
 motorcycle and 90 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.619
 installed browsers in which 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.449
 we don't find the default one by find skai failla we find oprah 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.909
 ok uci world opera mini 4. 2t mini 5 beta work 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.340
 However, I have already looked further into one 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.220
 have already been placed on the network have been executed on a samsung i85 10 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.250
 however the basic operating system that the same there are only a few 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.720
 small diversity 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.979
 crown this poem phone. 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.270
 the quiet passage and small screen. external 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.230
 and hello home screen interior - July general occasions problems what 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.550
 absolutely not working scaispa yesterday in fact having skai failla 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.250
 until we live with the external screen there are no pizza menu problems 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 800 internal Ferrara is clear 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.020
 even using a connection you can have a connection 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.020
 1 war 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.160
 uai fare fourth the problem still remains 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.700
 and as fun 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.229
 always try to connect 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.659
 but the fact of being on an unknown resolution but a symbian s60 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.240
 does not allow him to complete the connection question by the software 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 inevitable and eventually even. the visualization of pain 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.859
 they said the service is temporarily unavailable 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.079
 when it is absolutely not so because it is 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:14.119
 the terminal and going to manage scaispa earth with external extermination is obvious 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:19.609
 that is rustic pizza - exterior to navigate 4 inch ringo interior 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.849
 become a little bit 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.449
 superfluous 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:27.689
 but in any case using that exterior they use the same identical 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.349
 type of 1g connection 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.689
 we see 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
 testicles 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.870
 the browser has started from here on we can easily insert a 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.870
 any trouble 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.369
 we have that same evening on the same diamond 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.019
 options we have already seen on samsung and 85 10 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.409
 let's make a very quick demonstration of the fact that it gives this position 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.409
 functional 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:17.619
 as you can see the page has been betrayed 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.249
 at times when I decide to use the internal screen instead 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.479
 this is no longer possible 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.149
 facts as you see in the mind before the page had already loaded it 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:35.349
 completely now the loading bar must pop up again when the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.069
 page therefore kilobytes eyes to be able to be managed 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.519
 at this point we do 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.930
 exit from the program critical text 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:49.679
 get back to the error page 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.499
 at this point the other browsers available are the same as mentioned 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:01.499
 available for symbian s60 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.039
 I'm 30 and 'a look at us my opinion are too spartan neems in many 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.599
 cases have a graphic that was perhaps acceptable with the symbian anna in the 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.689
 operating system release 8 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.620
 for the best years in this case only the various versions of mini opera born in 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.300
 especially the four. 2 and 5 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.669
 the four. 2 art. opera mini tvnatin if on the internal screen give remarkable 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.780
 satisfactions at the time of navigation we insert an in-line d 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.969
 what can be 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.969
 center speed court 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.969
 loading 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.860
 my name is also the navigation the same access point 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.180
 telnet used 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.180
 first in this case it works perfectly 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.949
 and mm we say that and also in this case the contents are not supported 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.020
 r flash content with regards to loading the page itself 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.749
 there is no particular demerit note to the operating system 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.930
 I great 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.930
 as for more than I would like 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.710
 we have the same tactics we find on symbian anna 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.919
 wilson's disease obviously suited to the internal screen 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.960
 personally however I do not recommend them because they are not in my opinion 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:50.829
 although they have recently been released, the aesthetics are the only faults 

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:56.249
 at least on ebay the menu item and the suicidal voice appear 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:00.309
 it's as if you were unemployed in the lower left corner below 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:02.589
 on the right instead of 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:09.149
 in berlin I sing aran right and in the lower right, in fact, this one in here 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.210
 actually connected to this stockists 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.619
 we can easily do exit we exit 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:18.469
 however e 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:24.089
 this is the only lacunar graphic to underline however my advice is 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:25.249
 use 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:29.119
 the browser operates mini tv regarding the use on the screen 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:30.419
 indoor 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.059
 I would say that it is almost perfect 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.949
 soon a greeting from giuseppe boys
