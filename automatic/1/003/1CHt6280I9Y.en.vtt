get a Jamaican black castor oil the main
difference<00:02:00.750> between<00:02:00.899> these<00:02:01.500> two<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.670> way

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
difference between these two is the way

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.690 
difference between these two is the way
in<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.630> castor<00:02:04.500> nuts<00:02:04.770> were<00:02:05.130> processed

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
in which the castor nuts were processed

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
in which the castor nuts were processed
so<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> nuts<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> Jamaican<00:02:06.930> black<00:02:07.110> castor

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
so the nuts in the Jamaican black castor

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
so the nuts in the Jamaican black castor
oil<00:02:07.590> where<00:02:08.129> roasted<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.179> gives<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
oil where roasted so that gives it a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.400 
oil where roasted so that gives it a
darker<00:02:10.319> color<00:02:10.590> as

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
darker color as
