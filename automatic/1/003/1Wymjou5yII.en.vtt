00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.120
 for this we need 50 grams 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.389
 butter 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.279

 100 grams of sugar a tablespoon and a bowl 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.449
 next we have to separate the proteins from 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:30.689
 yolks and whip whites in a thick foam 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:32.399
 Mixer gradually add sugar if 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.030
 you want you can add 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.890
 like white sugar and dark myself 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:54.090
 add such a bit 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.960
 stir then cut off the butter 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.989
 how much do we need 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.799
 and put it in a bowl to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.330
 melt I think constantly 20 seconds 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.680
 Now we wait while she is slightly 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.729
 stir 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.750
 after we mixed and then 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.750
 we lay out a big spoon 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.640
 like small tortillas to me 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.820

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.720
 2 minutes left confusing 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.170
 so 1 minute 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.020
