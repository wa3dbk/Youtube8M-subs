00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 m 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.420
 it should not be easy for example

 one from Spain but we are writing so you can see much less 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.460
 for example, we type 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.640

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.350
 let's go to the page 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770
 engines 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.970
 and there is advantage 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.700
 January 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.900
 as well as being evaluated when it starts to leave 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 and once they have subscribed to a 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.910
 to take advantage of 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.329

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.650
 By the way, this problem has a lot 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.469
 many emotions like here is the start of television looking for music 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.729
