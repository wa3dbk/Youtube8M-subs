00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
votes to go off of and I did it kinda in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.649 
votes to go off of and I did it kinda in
the<00:01:25.799> middle<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> day<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.420> people

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the middle of the day a lot of people

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
the middle of the day a lot of people
probably<00:01:27.689> were<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.290> work<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> probably

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
probably were at work and probably

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
probably were at work and probably
weren't<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.640> social<00:01:30.210> media<00:01:30.240> during<00:01:30.840> those

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
weren't on social media during those

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.370 
weren't on social media during those
times<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.310> could<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
times so that could also be one of the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
times so that could also be one of the
reasons<00:01:34.710> why<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.460> said<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.700> wasn't

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
reasons why but like I said I wasn't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.050 
reasons why but like I said I wasn't
expecting<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.659> large<00:01:36.900> turnout<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.790> wanted

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
expecting a large turnout I just wanted

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
expecting a large turnout I just wanted
to<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.270> an<00:01:39.420> idea<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.650> people<00:01:40.860> wanted

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to get an idea of what the people wanted

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.120 
to get an idea of what the people wanted
to<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.329> course<00:01:42.600> majority<00:01:43.140> rules<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.860> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to see and of course majority rules so I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.319
