00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 And you're in doubt about your 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.430
 car, so stay tuned because you're in the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.020
 time of the week tip with our 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.020
 specialist benÃª gomes 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 today we talk about automotive armor 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.369
 and you know who thinks about it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 the biggest concern is still the issue of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 additional vehicle weight 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 but know that a lot has changed in the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 last years so it's always worth it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 know this process better 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.789
 this matter goes to lucas too 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.420
 castro there big field in mato grosso 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.420
 southern 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 There is no way the armored car is always 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.210
 heavier, which raises a lot of doubt 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.670
 who thinks of looking for this service 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 but it is also a fact that this concern 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 has been decreasing since technology 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.539
 applied in the production of the armored 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.539
 by constant development 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.540
 a survey made by abrablin 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.740
 brazilian armor association 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.530
 showed the ranking of the most 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.950
 armored vehicles in the country last year 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 the first on the list is the volvo xc60 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.990
 followed by the Volkswagen Tiguan and in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.330
 third the toyota corolla that shows 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.000
 that the variety of automobiles grew 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 considerably in recent years and is the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.479
 weight reduction 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.450
 aggregate 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.090
 thanks to the new shielding solutions a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.050
 car considering an average weight of 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.840
 1,500 and 1,600 kilos arrived around 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.960
 20 percent of the skill's weight 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.899
 this is it in the 90s with the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.640
 Polycarbonate glass is thus in place 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.259
 aramid then there was a large 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.090
 evolution we today can talk 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 some models vary from model to model. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.020
 model but has already weighed models with 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.660
 10% 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.910
 dispense of aggregate weight of materials 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.670
 which interfere more with the final weight of the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.520
 armored car the glass as it is of 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.009
 think is most responsible one 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.950
 level 3 shield which is the most 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.709
 common the weight of 21 mm glass 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.959
 can reach 47 kilos per meter 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.880
 square but the more modern as b-33 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.540
 weighing up to 36 kilos per meter 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 square the good is that although lighter 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.580
 it maintains the ability to absorb the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 impact of a bullet besides contributing 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.750
 for the best weight distribution of the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.300
 this is one of the points that most 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.840
 if you are currently working to determine the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.810
 not only is it overweight that has been added it has a 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.400
 very objective control of the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.830
 in terms of reproducibility projects 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.989
 project to reduce increasingly 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.910
 weight but also in the distribution of this 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.830
 how it will impact 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.160
 in the stability of the car 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.830
 only in 2011 were more than 8 thousand cars 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.239
 10 percent greater than the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 that in the previous year 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.920
 demand increases and the way it is 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.920
 produced armored car evolves 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.620
 using automated processes that 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.170
 recognize the particular settings 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.650
 of each model 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.650
 of the brand
