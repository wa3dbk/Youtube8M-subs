unnecessarily<00:00:45.570> sarcastic<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.190> fair

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
unnecessarily sarcastic and to be fair

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
unnecessarily sarcastic and to be fair
Smith<00:00:48.300> must<00:00:48.539> probably<00:00:48.960> made<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.710> for

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
Smith must probably made this for

potato but anyway the steel that this
blade<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.129> made<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.750> somewhat<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> a

and on others I saw 440c which is kind
of<00:01:26.640> strange<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.590> generally<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
of strange because generally if it is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.789 
of strange because generally if it is
440<00:01:30.090> C<00:01:30.329> which<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.290> better<00:01:31.560> than<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.570> they

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
440 C which is a lot better than a they

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.410 
440 C which is a lot better than a they
generally<00:01:34.799> let<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.180> kind<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
generally let you know so it's kind of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.130 
generally let you know so it's kind of
strange<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:37.040> it's<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.310> consistent<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.270> all

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
strange that it's not consistent on all

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.039 
strange that it's not consistent on all
the<00:01:40.439> websites<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> who<00:01:42.060> knows<00:01:42.270> might<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.810> C

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the websites so who knows might be C

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.520 
the websites so who knows might be C
might<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:44.119> guess<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:46.320> assume

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
might be a I guess we can just assume

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.030 
might be a I guess we can just assume
that<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.939> information<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.570> correct<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that the information is correct so if it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
that the information is correct so if it
is<00:01:50.130> indeed<00:01:50.750> 440c<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.320> pretty<00:01:52.860> good

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
is indeed 440c it's actually pretty good

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.179 
is indeed 440c it's actually pretty good
for<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.759> budget<00:01:54.299> knife<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.770> thing<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
for a budget knife and one thing that I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.539 
for a budget knife and one thing that I
definitely<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.790> about<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:58.549> they

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
definitely like about this is that they

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.749 
definitely like about this is that they
knew<00:01:59.880> how<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.100> proper<00:02:02.100> edge<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
knew how to put a proper edge on this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.350 
knew how to put a proper edge on this
that<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.049> nice

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
that is very nice

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.900 
that is very nice
now<00:02:05.660> way<00:02:05.900> too<00:02:05.930> many<00:02:06.230> knives<00:02:06.500> come<00:02:06.920> with<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.160> dull

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
now way too many knives come with a dull

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.700 
now way too many knives come with a dull
edge<00:02:08.150> and<00:02:08.570> then<00:02:09.140> they<00:02:09.229> have<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.470> nerve<00:02:09.650> to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
edge and then they have the nerve to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.060 
edge and then they have the nerve to
call<00:02:10.040> that<00:02:10.250> razor<00:02:10.970> sharp<00:02:11.510> but<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:12.920> is

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
call that razor sharp but this here is

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.670 
call that razor sharp but this here is
definitely<00:02:13.640> very<00:02:14.180> sharp<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.750> not<00:02:15.110> hair

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
definitely very sharp it's not hair

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.190 
definitely very sharp it's not hair
shaving<00:02:16.070> sharp<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.790> don't<00:02:17.000> think<00:02:17.270> nope

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
shaving sharp I don't think nope

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.450 
shaving sharp I don't think nope
definitely<00:02:18.830> not<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.390> absolutely

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
definitely not but it is absolutely

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.890 
definitely not but it is absolutely
functionally<00:02:22.460> sharp<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:25.550> case<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.480> a

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
functionally sharp and in case of a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.170 
functionally sharp and in case of a
knife<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.500> which<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.030> know

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
knife like this which is you know

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.720 
knife like this which is you know
clearly<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.810> combat<00:02:30.350> design<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.400> don't<00:02:31.580> really

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
clearly a combat design you don't really

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.400 
clearly a combat design you don't really
have<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.060> worry<00:02:32.270> about<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.720> retention<00:02:33.080> too

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
have to worry about that retention too

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.490 
have to worry about that retention too
much<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.940> general<00:02:35.450> idea<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:36.020> at

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
much because the general idea is at

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.890 
much because the general idea is at
least<00:02:36.740> if<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.010> carry<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.580> as<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.870> know

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
least if you carry that as a you know

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.950 
least if you carry that as a you know
private<00:02:39.230> person<00:02:39.620> as<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.740> citizen<00:02:40.220> for

private person as a citizen for

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.310 
private person as a citizen for
self-defense<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.620> idea<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.320> you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
self-defense the idea is that you you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.040 
self-defense the idea is that you you
know<00:02:45.440> have<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> sharp<00:02:46.460> knife<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.720> carry

know have a sharp knife that you carry

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.690 
know have a sharp knife that you carry
on<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.680> you'll<00:02:48.830> hopefully<00:02:49.010> never<00:02:49.490> have

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
on you that you'll hopefully never have

on you that you'll hopefully never have
to<00:02:49.820> use<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.570> even<00:02:51.110> if<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.320> do<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.650> only<00:02:51.800> has<00:02:52.010> to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
to use and even if you do it only has to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.660 
to use and even if you do it only has to
be<00:02:52.310> sharp<00:02:52.580> once<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.930> will<00:02:54.430> unless<00:02:55.430> you're

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
be sharp once if you will unless you're

not<00:03:59.420> even<00:03:59.600> sure<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.810> shows<00:04:00.500> up<00:04:00.770> there<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.280> is

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
not even sure that shows up there it is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.840 
not even sure that shows up there it is
you<00:04:02.810> know<00:04:02.930> not<00:04:03.560> very<00:04:03.620> pronounced<00:04:04.550> at<00:04:04.670> all

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
you know not very pronounced at all

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.170 
you know not very pronounced at all
aside<00:04:05.660> from<00:04:06.130> up<00:04:07.130> here<00:04:07.820> it's<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.239> bit<00:04:08.390> rougher

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
aside from up here it's a bit rougher

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.320 
aside from up here it's a bit rougher
and<00:04:12.310> what<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.340> also<00:04:13.490> really<00:04:13.850> like<00:04:14.000> about<00:04:14.150> the

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
and what I also really like about the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.759 
and what I also really like about the
guard<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:16.630> curvature<00:04:17.630> here<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.049> perfect

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
guard is the curvature here is perfect

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.849 
guard is the curvature here is perfect
put<00:04:18.889> your<00:04:19.039> thumb<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.660> really<00:04:21.019> facilitates

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
put your thumb so it really facilitates

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.790 
put your thumb so it really facilitates
the<00:04:22.639> saber<00:04:22.940> grip<00:04:23.300> which<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.139> of<00:04:24.410> course<00:04:24.620> good

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
the saber grip which is of course good

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.369 
the saber grip which is of course good
for<00:04:25.039> extra<00:04:25.610> reach<00:04:25.789> and<00:04:26.120> control<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:29.379> of

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:30.379 
for extra reach and control and of

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.589 
for extra reach and control and of
course<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.889> guard<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:31.550> it's<00:04:31.759> good<00:04:31.879> to<00:04:31.909> have<00:04:32.210> on<00:04:32.569> a

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
course a guard so it's good to have on a

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.460 
course a guard so it's good to have on a
combat<00:04:33.349> knife<00:04:34.539> this<00:04:35.539> is<00:04:35.720> obviously<00:04:36.229> not

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
combat knife this is obviously not

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.790 
combat knife this is obviously not
something<00:04:37.039> for<00:04:37.310> EDC<00:04:38.270> tool<00:04:38.629> use<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.650> is

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
something for EDC tool use this is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.909

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.270 
designed for the the sheath here is
pretty<00:04:59.449> well<00:04:59.659> made

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
pretty well made

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.620 
pretty well made
you<00:05:01.280> know<00:05:01.430> quite<00:05:01.729> sturdy<00:05:02.000> overall<00:05:02.509> and<00:05:04.630> the

you know quite sturdy overall and the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.339 
you know quite sturdy overall and the
only<00:05:06.560> slight<00:05:06.919> issue<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.580> have<00:05:07.759> with<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.030> is

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
only slight issue that I have with it is

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.100 
only slight issue that I have with it is
the<00:05:09.430> belt<00:05:10.430> clip<00:05:10.610> or<00:05:10.940> boot<00:05:11.330> clip<00:05:11.630> if<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.810> will

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
the belt clip or boot clip if you will

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.040 
the belt clip or boot clip if you will
here<00:05:12.349> is<00:05:13.840> kind<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:15.159> loose<00:05:16.300> not<00:05:17.300> very<00:05:17.539> stiff<00:05:17.900> at

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
here is kind of loose not very stiff at

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.619 
here is kind of loose not very stiff at
all<00:05:18.199> so<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.860> don't<00:05:19.009> think<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.610> would<00:05:19.789> hold

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
all so I don't think this would hold

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.320 
all so I don't think this would hold
overly<00:05:21.409> well<00:05:21.680> then<00:05:22.280> again<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.789> very<00:05:22.819> long

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
overly well then again it's a very long

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.700 
overly well then again it's a very long
clip<00:05:23.719> so<00:05:24.490> maybe<00:05:25.490> it's<00:05:25.669> not<00:05:25.789> really<00:05:26.060> an<00:05:26.120> issue

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
clip so maybe it's not really an issue

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.770 
clip so maybe it's not really an issue
there's<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.860> snap<00:05:28.400> closure<00:05:28.639> there<00:05:29.150> it's<00:05:29.719> very

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
there's a snap closure there it's very

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.510 
there's a snap closure there it's very
quick<00:05:30.139> and<00:05:30.319> easy<00:05:30.349> to<00:05:30.620> draw<00:05:30.830> basically<00:05:31.280> just

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
quick and easy to draw basically just

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.700 
quick and easy to draw basically just
have<00:05:31.669> to<00:05:31.759> reach<00:05:31.909> in<00:05:32.120> there<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.409> draw<00:05:33.409> it<00:05:33.590> out

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
have to reach in there and draw it out

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.129 
have to reach in there and draw it out
it<00:05:34.009> doesn't<00:05:34.310> snag<00:05:34.550> anywhere<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.719> overall<00:05:35.990> a

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
it doesn't snag anywhere so overall a
