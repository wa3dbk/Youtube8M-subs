00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
board has a huge cult following again

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
board has a huge cult following again
just<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.219> number<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> waves<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.059> can

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
just because the number of waves you can

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.060 
just because the number of waves you can
catch<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> range<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
catch on it and then the range of you is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
catch on it and then the range of you is
this<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.670> board<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.540> based<00:00:40.170> off<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
this this board is based off of that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
this this board is based off of that
board<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.010> comes<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> same<00:00:41.760> mold<00:00:41.969> when

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
board it comes out of the same mold when

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
board it comes out of the same mold when
it's<00:00:42.390> being<00:00:42.540> made<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.440> only<00:00:43.739> difference<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it's being made the only difference is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.850 
it's being made the only difference is
that<00:00:44.910> rather<00:00:45.090> than<00:00:45.270> having<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.690> wax<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.260> 12-foot

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that rather than having to wax a 12-foot

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.290 
that rather than having to wax a 12-foot
board

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
board

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.779 
board
they<00:00:48.300> put<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> 12-foot<00:00:49.350> deck<00:00:49.739> pad<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
they put a 12-foot deck pad on it so you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
they put a 12-foot deck pad on it so you
basically<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.149> track<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> full

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
basically have track from the full

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
basically have track from the full
length<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> board<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> never<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
length of the board you never have to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.290 
length of the board you never have to
worry<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.270> wax<00:00:54.680> melting<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:56.610> relaxing

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
worry about the wax melting or relaxing

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.549 
worry about the wax melting or relaxing
the<00:00:57.390> board<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.719> different<00:00:58.140> water

temperatures<00:00:59.100> which<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.489> actually<00:00:59.609> be

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
temperatures which can actually be

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
temperatures which can actually be
pretty<00:01:00.480> time-consuming<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
pretty time-consuming when you have a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.759 
pretty time-consuming when you have a
board<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.309> big<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:03.930> even<00:01:04.379> more

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
board this big and it's also even more

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.910 
board this big and it's also even more
durable<00:01:05.189> than<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.470> standard<00:01:07.470> tough<00:01:07.680> light

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
composites that they're using are going

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.990 
composites that they're using are going
to<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.330> even<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.720> thing<00:01:12.990> resistant<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
with a full length deck cut so what can

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.310 
with a full length deck cut so what can
you<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> board<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:27.320> starting

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you do with a board like this starting

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
you do with a board like this starting
out<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.250> serve<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> smallest<00:01:29.939> wave

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
out with you can serve the smallest wave

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
out with you can serve the smallest wave
that<00:01:30.479> you've<00:01:30.600> ever<00:01:30.750> seen<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.560> might<00:01:31.740> not

that you've ever seen that might not

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.770 
that you've ever seen that might not
even<00:01:32.159> break<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> wave<00:01:33.390> that's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
even break you can have a wave that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.469 
even break you can have a wave that's
ankle<00:01:34.200> high<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:35.040> never<00:01:35.490> gets<00:01:35.729> beyond<00:01:35.970> 45

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
ankle high that never gets beyond 45

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
ankle high that never gets beyond 45
degrees<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.140> surf<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.520> longer

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
degrees and you can surf it for longer

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.359 
degrees and you can surf it for longer
then<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.240> serve<00:01:39.450> an<00:01:39.600> actual<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.110> wave

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
then you can serve an actual good wave

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.920 
then you can serve an actual good wave
it's<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.520> an<00:01:41.640> unbelievable<00:01:41.850> amount<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> glide

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
it's got an unbelievable amount of glide

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's got an unbelievable amount of glide
through<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.229> water<00:01:43.350> an<00:01:43.770> amazing<00:01:44.250> paddle

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
through the water an amazing paddle

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.780 
through the water an amazing paddle
speed<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.110> take<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.860> far<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
speed so you can take off as far as the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
speed so you can take off as far as the
longboarders<00:01:48.450> sit<00:01:49.259> outside<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.860> shore

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
longboarders sit outside the shore

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.679 
longboarders sit outside the shore
borders<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> board<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.570> could

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
borders on a board like this you could

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
borders on a board like this you could
sit<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.259> part<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.770> outside<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> long

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
sit that part again outside the long

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.940 
sit that part again outside the long
border<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.509> anyway<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.170> want<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.770> can

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
border so anyway if you want you can

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.550 
border so anyway if you want you can
catch<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:58.020> reasonably<00:01:58.469> good

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
catch and and have reasonably good

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.289 
catch and and have reasonably good
performance<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.520> well<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.880> board<00:02:00.119> has

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
performance on it as well the board has

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:00.850 
performance on it as well the board has
a<00:02:00.329> lot

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
a lot

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
head out of the board and you can also

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.669 
head out of the board and you can also
tell<00:02:08.149> if<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:08.780> drop<00:02:09.080> it

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
tell if I drop it

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
how much rocker the board has so it's

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.210 
how much rocker the board has so it's
got<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.630> lot<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> B<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.410> roll<00:02:12.620> off<00:02:12.800> within<00:02:13.100> the
