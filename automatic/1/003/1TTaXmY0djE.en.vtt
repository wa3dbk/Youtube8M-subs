00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.689
 I have so many things 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.539
 ask again and again what is actually 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.000
 to become at risk from the road again 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.890
 you cut radically now 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.529
 the picture has changed a bit 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 in front of the fashion because threaten because I have 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.269
 the white bench removed 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.269
 but here is the result 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.050
 It's been almost two years since he arrived 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.030
 this radical cut got this 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.769
 hole what was created here could only 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.920
 arise because a fan 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.260
 It is allowed to grow there is outside 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.470
 but the hole will not be like that 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.960
 Close quickly 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.330
 I guess the flowers in two 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.580
 weeks on then I still go 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.580
 once the plant over 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.220
 close to down now it goes with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.220
 the title 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.510
 yes there she is now in full bloom 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.100
 you can already see how the next shoots 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.080
 to develop what you know 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.100
 could 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.100
 I have another patient here 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.230
 but first the radical 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:37.350
 cut down so that's how it looks 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.270
 result from when you align it in 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.200
 far down cuts and long wooden 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:49.230
 reste also assumes that's exactly what 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.620
 one new patient here has down 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.050
 cometh to nothing more there 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.470
 Not when we look at the back 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.380
 look at the page 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.390
 that means this was then around the will 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.220
 have a fate similar to this 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.260
 here 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.260
 only then will it be transplanted
