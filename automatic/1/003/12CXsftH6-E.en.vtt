at about 851 you seem to leave the c
minor<00:01:07.439> pentatonic<00:01:08.420> mmm<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.750> later<00:01:10.020> he

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
minor pentatonic mmm and then later he

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
minor pentatonic mmm and then later he
says<00:01:10.500> could<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> possibly<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.280> another

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
says could you possibly do another

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
says could you possibly do another
lesson<00:01:11.759> on<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.090> concept<00:01:12.540> maybe<00:01:13.200> using<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
lesson on this concept maybe using it to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
lesson on this concept maybe using it to
get<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.759> outside<00:01:15.150> soloing<00:01:15.659> over<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> jazz

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
get sort of outside soloing over a jazz

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.280 
get sort of outside soloing over a jazz
standard<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.520> only<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.049> chord

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
standard and not only on a one chord

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.039 
standard and not only on a one chord
vamp<00:01:20.030> okay<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.540> first<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
vamp okay so I think the first thing I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
vamp okay so I think the first thing I
should<00:01:22.080> address<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
should address there is that I think the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
should address there is that I think the
vamp<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.540> video<00:01:25.369> was<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.640> F<00:01:26.820> 7th<00:01:27.240> vamp<00:01:27.479> not

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
vamp in that video was an F 7th vamp not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
vamp in that video was an F 7th vamp not
a<00:01:28.020> C<00:01:28.380> minor<00:01:28.619> vamp<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.189> they're<00:01:29.730> pretty

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
a C minor vamp but they're pretty

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810 
a C minor vamp but they're pretty
closely<00:01:30.570> related<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.580> kind<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
closely related so I can kind of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170 
closely related so I can kind of
understand<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.310> um<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.850> first<00:01:36.060> thing

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
understand that but um the first thing

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
understand that but um the first thing
I'd<00:01:36.390> say<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.659> make<00:01:37.260> sure<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> take<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.830> at

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I'd say is make sure you take a look at

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.470 
I'd say is make sure you take a look at
the<00:01:38.130> pentatonic<00:01:38.520> videos<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.210> I've<00:01:39.330> already

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
the pentatonic videos that I've already

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.540 
the pentatonic videos that I've already
done<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.650> homepage<00:01:40.860> on

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
done so just go to my homepage on

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.420 
done so just go to my homepage on
YouTube<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.800> search<00:01:43.800> for<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> pentatonic

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
YouTube and search for the pentatonic

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.820 
YouTube and search for the pentatonic
videos<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:45.900> do<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.800> good

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
videos but I do think it's a good

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.700 
videos but I do think it's a good
question<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.540> why<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> look<00:01:49.470> at

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
question so why don't we take a look at

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.070 
question so why don't we take a look at
a<00:01:49.740> standard<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.940> now<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.930> ways

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
a standard right now and in some ways

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.880 
a standard right now and in some ways
you<00:01:52.320> might<00:01:52.470> play<00:01:52.770> Pentatonix<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.970> top<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
you might play Pentatonix on top of it

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.230 
you might play Pentatonix on top of it
alright<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.430> example<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
alright so for this example I'm going to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.670 
alright so for this example I'm going to
use<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.420> video<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.810> already<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.290> lying<00:01:58.530> around

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680

ahead<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.409> I<00:02:10.440> was<00:02:10.679> trying<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.519> do<00:02:11.640> some

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
ahead and then I was trying to do some

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.380 
ahead and then I was trying to do some
of<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:11.970> pentatonic<00:02:12.299> ideas<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.390> beginning

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of the pentatonic ideas on the beginning

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.990 
of the pentatonic ideas on the beginning
of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.569> second<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.110> section<00:02:16.409> here<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.370> I'm<00:02:17.790> just

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
of the second a section here so I'm just

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.610 
of the second a section here so I'm just
going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> play<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.989> then<00:02:19.500> I'll

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
going to play it for you and then I'll

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:43.790 
going to play it for you and then I'll
talk<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.400> bit<00:02:20.549> about<00:02:20.730> it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.870 

okay<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:44.860> what<00:02:45.070> I've<00:02:45.160> done<00:02:45.280> here<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.670> I've

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
okay so what I've done here is I've

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.250 
okay so what I've done here is I've
transcribed<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.530> first<00:02:48.120> three<00:02:49.120> bars<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
transcribed the first three bars of the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.800 
transcribed the first three bars of the
second<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.830> section<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.360> where<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.690> was

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
second a section and this is where I was

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.460 
second a section and this is where I was
trying<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.950> lot<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> pentatonic

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
trying to do a lot of the pentatonic

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.810 
trying to do a lot of the pentatonic
ideas<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.710> I<00:02:56.770> think<00:02:57.010> you're<00:02:57.160> referencing<00:02:57.370> in

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
ideas that I think you're referencing in

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.460 
ideas that I think you're referencing in
your<00:02:57.940> question<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.900> let's<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.230> take<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.380> look

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
your question so let's just take a look

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.280 
your question so let's just take a look
at<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> first<00:02:59.920> bar<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.080> what<00:03:02.200> I've

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
at the first bar and so what I've

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.810 
at the first bar and so what I've
written<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.190> original<00:03:03.310> chord

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
written here is the original chord

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.340 
written here is the original chord
changes<00:03:04.180> like<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.450> ones<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.840> appear<00:03:05.170> in<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
changes like the ones that appear in the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.470 
changes like the ones that appear in the
real<00:03:05.500> book<00:03:05.740> which<00:03:06.550> aren't<00:03:06.790> necessarily<00:03:07.240> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
real book which aren't necessarily the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.830 
real book which aren't necessarily the
chord<00:03:07.690> changes<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> use<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:10.720> know<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
chord changes that I use but you know a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.780 
chord changes that I use but you know a
lot<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.050> people<00:03:11.320> do<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:12.070> put<00:03:12.400> them<00:03:12.490> in<00:03:12.610> there

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
lot of people do so I put them in there

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.120 
lot of people do so I put them in there
and<00:03:12.970> then<00:03:13.840> below<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.290> put<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.650> actual

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
and then below that I put the actual

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.700 
and then below that I put the actual
chords<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:16.270> I'm<00:03:16.420> implying<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.320> then

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
chords that I'm implying and then

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.790 
chords that I'm implying and then
further<00:03:18.520> below<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.210> label<00:03:20.200> where<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.410> put

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
further below that I label where I put

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.490 
further below that I label where I put
the<00:03:21.250> pentatonic<00:03:21.610> scales<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.270> in<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
the pentatonic scales so in the the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.930 
the pentatonic scales so in the the
first<00:03:23.709> bar<00:03:23.950> let's<00:03:24.250> talk<00:03:24.430> about<00:03:24.580> this<00:03:24.820> is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
first bar let's talk about this is

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.880 
first bar let's talk about this is
really<00:03:25.120> important<00:03:25.540> because<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.770> the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
really important because this is the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.850 
really important because this is the
first<00:03:27.070> way<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.580> which<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.240> would<00:03:28.860> imply

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
first way in which you would imply

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.280 
first way in which you would imply
pentatonix<00:03:30.580> outside<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.209> key<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.660> that's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
pentatonix outside of the key and that's

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.770 
pentatonix outside of the key and that's
what's<00:03:32.800> called<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> side<00:03:33.370> slip<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.630> what

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
what's called the side slip and so what

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.230 
what's called the side slip and so what
I<00:03:34.810> do<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.380> actually<00:03:35.820> use<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.850> pentatonic

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
I do here is I actually use a pentatonic

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.420 
I do here is I actually use a pentatonic
a<00:03:37.660> half<00:03:37.870> step<00:03:38.170> above<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.560> root<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> chord

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
a half step above the root of the chord

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.710 
a half step above the root of the chord
in<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.880> second<00:03:40.300> half<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.720> measure<00:03:40.959> and

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
in the second half of the measure and

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.140 
in the second half of the measure and
you<00:03:43.720> know<00:03:43.840> that's<00:03:44.080> just<00:03:44.230> something<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
you know that's just something that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.699 
you know that's just something that
gives<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.240> sort<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.720> heightened<00:03:47.140> sensation

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
gives you sort of a heightened sensation

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.430 
gives you sort of a heightened sensation
I<00:03:48.250> think<00:03:48.540> when<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.630> when<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.410> I

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
I think when you when you do that and I

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.600 
I think when you when you do that and I
think<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.709> really<00:03:50.830> important<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.400> think

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
think it's really important to think

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.550 
think it's really important to think
about<00:03:52.300> where<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.630> line<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.050> going<00:03:53.260> so

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
about where the line is going so

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.410 
about where the line is going so
oftentimes<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:54.459> where<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.760> would<00:03:55.030> do<00:03:55.239> that

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
oftentimes like where I would do that

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.500 
oftentimes like where I would do that
would<00:03:56.350> be<00:03:56.560> when<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.190> have<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.640> one<00:03:57.910> chord<00:03:58.269> and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
would be when you have a one chord and

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.540 
would be when you have a one chord and
then<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.720> 2/5<00:03:59.290> that's<00:03:59.920> related<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.459> a

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
then a 2/5 that's related to a

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.910 
then a 2/5 that's related to a
proceeding<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.390> for<00:04:01.930> example<00:04:02.320> like<00:04:02.470> I'd<00:04:02.680> play

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
proceeding so for example like I'd play

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.430 
proceeding so for example like I'd play
F<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.940> then<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.360> F<00:04:04.450> sharp<00:04:04.480> pentatonic<00:04:05.320> and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
F and then the F sharp pentatonic and

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.650 
F and then the F sharp pentatonic and
then<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.400> G<00:04:06.580> minor<00:04:06.820> next<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.510> have

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
then go to the G minor next and you have

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.330 
then go to the G minor next and you have
like<00:04:07.810> this<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.410> nice<00:04:08.560> chromatic<00:04:08.980> line

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
like this really nice chromatic line

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.550 
like this really nice chromatic line
which<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:09.880> going<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.540> other<00:04:10.570> way<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:11.110> this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
which is going the other way in this

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.360 
which is going the other way in this
case<00:04:11.830> it's<00:04:12.100> not<00:04:12.220> quite<00:04:12.550> that<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:14.280> think<00:04:15.280> the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
case it's not quite that but I think the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.710 
case it's not quite that but I think the
notes<00:04:15.610> are<00:04:16.769> closely<00:04:17.769> related<00:04:17.950> enough<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.820> it

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
notes are closely related enough that it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.430 
notes are closely related enough that it
makes<00:04:19.989> sense<00:04:20.220> at<00:04:21.220> least<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.640> my<00:04:21.730> ear<00:04:22.110> so<00:04:23.110> yeah

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
makes sense at least in my ear so yeah

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.469 
makes sense at least in my ear so yeah
basically<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:24.010> play<00:04:24.220> F<00:04:24.400> major<00:04:24.610> pentatonic<00:04:25.000> and

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
basically I play F major pentatonic and

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.750 
basically I play F major pentatonic and
then<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:26.169> just<00:04:26.470> completely<00:04:26.830> sideslip<00:04:27.310> out<00:04:27.550> a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
then I just completely sideslip out a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.730 
then I just completely sideslip out a
half<00:04:28.000> step<00:04:28.270> above<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.840> all<00:04:29.050> those<00:04:29.320> notes<00:04:29.500> in

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
half step above and all those notes in

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.850 
half step above and all those notes in
the<00:04:29.830> second<00:04:30.130> part<00:04:30.310> are<00:04:30.550> completely<00:04:31.300> outside

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
the second part are completely outside

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.960 
the second part are completely outside
now<00:04:32.860> let's<00:04:33.010> talk<00:04:33.130> about<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.430> second<00:04:33.820> measure

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
now let's talk about the second measure

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.690 
now let's talk about the second measure
here<00:04:34.300> because<00:04:34.660> this<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:34.960> where<00:04:35.110> things<00:04:35.700> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
here because this is where things you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.550 
here because this is where things you
know<00:04:36.790> may<00:04:36.970> seem<00:04:37.300> more<00:04:37.570> outside<00:04:38.169> than<00:04:38.410> they

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
know may seem more outside than they

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.030 
know may seem more outside than they
really<00:04:38.860> are

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
really are

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.580 
really are
just<00:04:39.640> because<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.060> context<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:40.870> what<00:04:41.410> you're

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
just because the context in what you're

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.880 
just because the context in what you're
hearing<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:43.210> what<00:04:43.810> what<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.560> kind<00:04:44.800> of

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
hearing it so what what this kind of

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.830 
hearing it so what what this kind of
pentatonic<00:04:45.370> effect<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:46.120> it's<00:04:46.450> different

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
pentatonic effect is is it's different

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.480 
pentatonic effect is is it's different
it's<00:04:47.020> not<00:04:47.080> outside<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.650> key<00:04:47.919> it's<00:04:48.100> just

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
it's not outside the key it's just

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.770 
it's not outside the key it's just
implying<00:04:49.090> tensions<00:04:49.960> on<00:04:50.800> top<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.970> cord<00:04:52.300> so

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
implying tensions on top of a cord so

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.960 
implying tensions on top of a cord so
the<00:04:53.110> court<00:04:53.710> stated<00:04:54.460> here<00:04:54.669> is<00:04:54.760> f<00:04:54.940> sharp

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
the court stated here is f sharp

the court stated here is f sharp

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.990 
but I I don't play F sharp diminished on
this<00:04:58.139> tune<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.680> second<00:04:59.039> bar<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.460> play<00:04:59.729> D

is<00:05:05.370> just<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:06.000> chord<00:05:06.389> that's<00:05:06.630> contained<00:05:07.199> within

is just a chord that's contained within

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the F sharp diminished so like when I'm

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.439 
the F sharp diminished so like when I'm
comping<00:05:11.220> I'm<00:05:11.580> not<00:05:11.759> going<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:11.970> play<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.210> big

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
comping I'm not going to play a big

clunky diminished chord myself I'm gonna

clunky diminished chord myself I'm gonna
usually<00:05:17.580> play<00:05:17.789> something<00:05:18.210> that's<00:05:18.389> inside<00:05:18.840> if

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
usually play something that's inside if

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.210 
usually play something that's inside if
you<00:05:19.169> look<00:05:19.380> at<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.560> construction<00:05:19.919> of<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
you look at the construction of the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.010 
you look at the construction of the
diminished<00:05:20.610> scale<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:21.360> have<00:05:21.389> all<00:05:21.810> these

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
diminished scale you have all these

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.820 
diminished scale you have all these
related<00:05:23.000> triads<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.330> this<00:05:24.599> dominant<00:05:25.500> seven

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
related triads and this dominant seven

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.100 
related triads and this dominant seven
which<00:05:25.979> is<00:05:26.160> related<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.849> so<00:05:27.360> I'm<00:05:27.660> not<00:05:27.690> really

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
which is related to it so I'm not really

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.219 
which is related to it so I'm not really
playing<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.590> pentatonic<00:05:28.889> scale<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:30.050> mean<00:05:31.050> the

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
playing a pentatonic scale I mean the

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.080 
playing a pentatonic scale I mean the
first<00:05:31.440> four<00:05:31.680> notes<00:05:31.860> there<00:05:32.159> I'm<00:05:32.520> playing<00:05:33.380> a

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
first four notes there I'm playing a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.860 
first four notes there I'm playing a
flat<00:05:36.090> 13<00:05:36.659> and<00:05:37.729> then<00:05:38.729> I'm<00:05:38.819> playing<00:05:39.030> a<00:05:39.180> flat<00:05:39.539> nine

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
flat 13 and then I'm playing a flat nine

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.249 
flat 13 and then I'm playing a flat nine
the<00:05:40.740> third<00:05:41.069> and<00:05:41.370> then<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.610> root<00:05:41.960> then<00:05:42.960> the

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
the third and then the root then the

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.240 
the third and then the root then the
next<00:05:43.620> part<00:05:44.370> of<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:45.120> chord<00:05:45.389> I<00:05:45.630> play<00:05:45.840> F<00:05:45.990> minor<00:05:46.259> on

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
next part of the chord I play F minor on

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.330 
next part of the chord I play F minor on
top<00:05:47.580> of<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:47.849> and<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:49.110> that's<00:05:49.349> giving<00:05:49.919> me<00:05:49.949> if

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
top of that and so that's giving me if

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.100 
top of that and so that's giving me if
we<00:05:50.610> were<00:05:50.699> gonna<00:05:50.789> relate<00:05:51.180> that<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.389> D<00:05:51.659> seven

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
we were gonna relate that to D seven

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.610 
we were gonna relate that to D seven
that's<00:05:52.680> giving<00:05:53.159> me<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:54.060> flat<00:05:54.840> seventh<00:05:55.349> and

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
that's giving me the flat seventh and

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.249 
that's giving me the flat seventh and
the<00:05:56.430> flat<00:05:56.669> five<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:59.190> flat<00:05:59.400> nine<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.259> then

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
the flat five and the flat nine and then

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.999 
the flat five and the flat nine and then
the<00:06:01.880> sharp<00:06:02.880> nine<00:06:03.090> there<00:06:03.539> and<00:06:03.840> then<00:06:04.229> if<00:06:04.560> you

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
the sharp nine there and then if you

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.260 
the sharp nine there and then if you
know<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:05.280> then<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.520> next<00:06:05.729> measure<00:06:05.909> I'm<00:06:06.090> just

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
know and then the next measure I'm just

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.649 
know and then the next measure I'm just
kind<00:06:06.479> of<00:06:06.509> going<00:06:06.900> back<00:06:07.050> into<00:06:07.289> G<00:06:07.800> minor<00:06:08.009> seven<00:06:08.659> so

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
kind of going back into G minor seven so

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.110 
kind of going back into G minor seven so
I<00:06:09.990> don't<00:06:10.560> want<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:10.949> think<00:06:11.219> that<00:06:11.909> I'm

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
I don't want you to think that I'm

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.209 
I don't want you to think that I'm
really<00:06:12.419> thinking<00:06:12.570> of<00:06:12.840> some<00:06:13.080> big<00:06:13.289> fancy<00:06:13.500> theory

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
really thinking of some big fancy theory

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.010 
really thinking of some big fancy theory
of<00:06:14.370> stacking<00:06:14.880> substitution<00:06:15.750> upon

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
of stacking substitution upon

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.409 
of stacking substitution upon
substitution<00:06:16.889> it<00:06:17.039> may<00:06:17.729> seem<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.060> way<00:06:18.360> but

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
substitution it may seem that way but

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.469 
substitution it may seem that way but
honestly<00:06:19.380> what<00:06:19.710> I'm<00:06:19.800> really<00:06:20.009> thinking<00:06:20.130> is<00:06:20.639> D

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
honestly what I'm really thinking is D

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.209 
honestly what I'm really thinking is D
seven<00:06:21.840> flat<00:06:22.020> nine<00:06:22.050> flat<00:06:22.469> thirteen<00:06:22.919> is<00:06:23.190> the

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
seven flat nine flat thirteen is the

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.339 
seven flat nine flat thirteen is the
related<00:06:23.880> chord<00:06:24.180> to<00:06:24.719> the<00:06:24.750> F<00:06:24.960> sharp<00:06:25.229> diminished

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
related chord to the F sharp diminished

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.100 
related chord to the F sharp diminished
and<00:06:25.969> I'm<00:06:26.969> playing<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.300> pentatonic<00:06:27.690> up<00:06:28.020> a

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
and I'm playing the pentatonic up a

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.860 
and I'm playing the pentatonic up a
minor<00:06:28.319> third<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:28.940> so<00:06:29.940> it's<00:06:30.180> it's<00:06:30.419> creating

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
minor third and so it's it's creating

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.080 
minor third and so it's it's creating
this<00:06:30.990> line<00:06:31.259> which<00:06:31.590> seems<00:06:31.949> to<00:06:32.400> have<00:06:32.819> a<00:06:32.849> lot<00:06:33.060> of

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
this line which seems to have a lot of

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.270 
this line which seems to have a lot of
tension<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:34.409> implied<00:06:35.389> chord<00:06:36.389> is<00:06:37.039> f<00:06:38.039> minor

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
tension and the implied chord is f minor

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.240 
tension and the implied chord is f minor
7th<00:06:38.699> there<00:06:38.849> but<00:06:39.120> in<00:06:39.780> all<00:06:39.960> honesty<00:06:40.440> I'm<00:06:40.590> really

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
7th there but in all honesty I'm really

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.830 
7th there but in all honesty I'm really
thinking<00:06:41.400> more<00:06:41.729> in<00:06:41.789> terms<00:06:41.909> of<00:06:42.330> just<00:06:42.599> the<00:06:42.719> F

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
thinking more in terms of just the F

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.649 
thinking more in terms of just the F
minor<00:06:43.110> triad<00:06:43.680> and<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:45.690> F<00:06:45.840> minor<00:06:46.130> pentatonic

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
minor triad and the F minor pentatonic

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.580 
minor triad and the F minor pentatonic
