official<00:00:14.030> I<00:00:16.310> I<00:00:17.630> think<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.920> when<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.220> 10

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
official I I think that when you are 10

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200 
official I I think that when you are 10
12<00:00:21.090> points<00:00:21.390> behind<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.670> understand<00:00:24.150> that

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
12 points behind you can understand that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.339 
12 points behind you can understand that
is<00:00:24.449> difficult<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.080> win<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.439> title<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:26.369> clearly

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
is difficult to win the title is clearly

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.890 
is difficult to win the title is clearly
when<00:00:28.349> you're<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.599> record

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
when you're a game that you can record

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.950 
when you're a game that you can record
this<00:00:31.109> point<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.740> note<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:33.180> was

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this point you can note this but was

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
this point you can note this but was
really<00:00:34.410> difficult<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.309> also<00:00:35.969> 10

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
really difficult to do this also 10

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.270 
really difficult to do this also 10
games<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> end<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.390> day<00:00:40.280> they

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
games to the end I think that day they

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
games to the end I think that day they
did<00:00:41.460> better<00:00:41.700> than<00:00:41.969> ass<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.770> won<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> lotto

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
did better than ass they won a lotto

did better than ass they won a lotto
game<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> row<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.530> difficult

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
game in a row was really difficult

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.950 
game in a row was really difficult
because<00:00:48.739> they<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.760> lose<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> point<00:00:51.600> also

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because they they they lose a point also

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
was it really just a matter of time

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.039 
was it really just a matter of time
