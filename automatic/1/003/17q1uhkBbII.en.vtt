kind<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.569> overdrive<00:00:07.379> pedal<00:00:07.799> because<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
kind of overdrive pedal because the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.280 
kind of overdrive pedal because the
Fender<00:00:09.120> Rhodes<00:00:09.150> needs<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.809> little<00:00:10.080> bit<00:00:10.200> of

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
Fender Rhodes needs a little bit of

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
Fender Rhodes needs a little bit of
boost<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.250> wanted<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> make<00:00:11.700> sure<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.940> had

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
boost and I wanted to make sure I had

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.720 
boost and I wanted to make sure I had
something<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.900> was<00:00:13.110> similar<00:00:13.769> enough<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
something that was similar enough to the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.390 
something that was similar enough to the
preamp<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.719> came<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.320> suitcase<00:00:16.890> models

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
preamp that came in the suitcase models

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.150 
preamp that came in the suitcase models
so<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> did<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> bunch<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.020> research<00:00:19.199> listen<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
so I did a bunch of research listen to a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390 
so I did a bunch of research listen to a
bunch<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> guitar<00:00:20.880> videos<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.949> what<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> chose

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
bunch of guitar videos and what I chose

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.230 
bunch of guitar videos and what I chose
was<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.109> OCD<00:00:25.109> 4<00:00:26.010> made<00:00:26.279> by<00:00:26.460> full<00:00:26.699> tone<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> I'll

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
was the OCD 4 made by full tone and I'll

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
was the OCD 4 made by full tone and I'll
try<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> zoom<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> little<00:00:28.170> bit<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> can

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
try to zoom in a little bit so you can

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
try to zoom in a little bit so you can
see<00:00:30.410> there<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:33.380> and<00:00:34.670> I<00:00:35.670> chose<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.180> one
