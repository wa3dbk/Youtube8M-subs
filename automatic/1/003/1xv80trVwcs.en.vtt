00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.480
 and today I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.430
 advent calendar or a 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.919
 calendar to count the days for 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.480
 Christmas and it's great then here 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.240
 gives us the instructions to start 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.299
 make a branch a sack and what of 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.570
 many colors a little paper scissors 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.840
 bookmarks and your favorite sweets 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.150
 let's start cutting the sack in 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.910
 thousands of squares good not thousands 25 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.830
 squares one for each day and they can be 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.960
 of any size I really the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.730
 I did as of all sizes and I 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.710
 he was super father then you do not have to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.670
 be very careful just cut 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.670
 many squares 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.910
 these squares are going to be your bags 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.130
 then what you do is put some 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.020
 how many sweeties take the four 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.660
 corners together and tie them with a 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.700
 thread later this is where your 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.980
 creativity and you have to put a 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.900
 number to each bag obviously from 1 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.390
 to 25 that are the days for Christmas 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.699
 from the company December and here you can 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.040
 use sharp paper and you can use 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.360
 many colors that you too 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 I recommend that you use ribbons of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.869
 different colors to make it look more 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.030
 father but just let your 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.360
 creativity flow and do what you 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.360
 want 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 and more or less that's how you have to 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.290
 to be as they see mine are 0 equal 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.270
 in fact that is how everything you try to 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.610
 put them all different a little bit 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.930
 creative and of different colors and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.509
 Now what you are going to do is take a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.600
 the one that you want and you are going to tie 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.009
 your trunk this I decided by the fireplace 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.080
 because it's based on what looks divine 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.759
 you can put it where you want and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 simply going to tie each 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.950
 sachet 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.140
 and that's how the truth is that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.540
 it's super easy to do and it looks divine 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.100
 besides that it's like a little gift for 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.500
 you because you like to suck here 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.910
 every day and of course count the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.890
 days left for Christmas that is 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.600
 super exciting I hope you will 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.920
