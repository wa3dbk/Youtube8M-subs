00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
corrector and I've actually used it a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.420 
corrector and I've actually used it a
few<00:00:23.670> times<00:00:24.029> before<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:25.199> I've<00:00:25.350> never<00:00:25.380> used<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
few times before but I've never used it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.769 
few times before but I've never used it
when<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.820> had<00:00:26.970> black<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.420> my<00:00:27.510> hair<00:00:27.689> I've

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
when I have had black in my hair I've

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.120 
when I have had black in my hair I've
not<00:00:27.930> used<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> had<00:00:28.590> read<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.890> my<00:00:28.980> hair

not used it when I had read in my hair
so<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> thought<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.849> try<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> again

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
so I thought that I would try it again

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.299 
so I thought that I would try it again
so<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> thought<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:32.070> show

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309

so I thought that I would actually show
you<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> use<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.360> then<00:00:33.570> show<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

more professional things like instead of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
more professional things like instead of
just<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.950> plain<00:00:44.100> kitchen<00:00:44.670> well<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
instead of getting one of the little

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
instead of getting one of the little
brush<00:00:50.160> things<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.090> use<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
brush things because I don't use the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.430

brush things on my hair

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
brush things on my hair
how<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.860> hands-on<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.510> if

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
how much more hands-on about it so if

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.439 
how much more hands-on about it so if
you<00:00:55.199> don't<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.100> use<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> brush

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you don't like that then use a brush

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
when you can see the difference so it's

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.340

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
did it and this is what I came out

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.120 
did it and this is what I came out
looking<00:05:29.330> like<00:05:29.360> if<00:05:30.140> you<00:05:30.350> see<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:30.620> mean<00:05:30.980> there's

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
looking like if you see I mean there's

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.440 
looking like if you see I mean there's
still<00:05:31.340> kind<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.670> little<00:05:31.910> bit<00:05:32.060> of<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.210> wrench

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
still kind of a little bit of a wrench

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.080 
still kind of a little bit of a wrench
reddish<00:05:33.140> tinge<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.710> it<00:05:33.980> which<00:05:34.670> is<00:05:34.820> a<00:05:34.850> little

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
reddish tinge to it which is a little

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.030 
reddish tinge to it which is a little
unfortunate<00:05:35.450> but<00:05:36.230> it's<00:05:36.380> not<00:05:36.530> as<00:05:36.650> bad<00:05:36.770> as<00:05:36.830> it

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
unfortunate but it's not as bad as it

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.190 
unfortunate but it's not as bad as it
was<00:05:37.160> before<00:05:37.340> but<00:05:38.270> this<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.780> kind<00:05:38.990> of<00:05:39.020> what<00:05:39.140> it

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
was before but this is kind of what it

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.260 
was before but this is kind of what it
looks<00:05:39.350> like<00:05:39.470> now<00:05:39.710> there's<00:05:40.670> like<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.850> random

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
looks like now there's like a random

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.940 
looks like now there's like a random
blonde<00:05:41.660> streak<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.320> don't<00:05:42.500> really<00:05:42.650> know<00:05:42.800> where

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
blonde streak I don't really know where

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.510 
blonde streak I don't really know where
that<00:05:42.980> came<00:05:43.280> from<00:05:43.360> but<00:05:44.360> yeah<00:05:45.100> if<00:05:46.100> you<00:05:46.250> see<00:05:46.430> it

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
that came from but yeah if you see it

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.670 
that came from but yeah if you see it
took<00:05:46.670> out<00:05:46.850> like<00:05:47.090> a<00:05:47.120> lot<00:05:47.420> of<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.780> red<00:05:47.960> it's

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
took out like a lot of the red it's

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.260 
took out like a lot of the red it's
mostly<00:05:49.010> it's<00:05:49.310> kind<00:05:49.640> of<00:05:49.700> still<00:05:49.910> has<00:05:50.030> like<00:05:50.180> a

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
mostly it's kind of still has like a

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.910 
mostly it's kind of still has like a
little<00:05:50.330> bit<00:05:50.450> of<00:05:50.570> an<00:05:50.690> orange<00:05:50.840> tinge<00:05:51.290> but<00:05:51.890> I

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
little bit of an orange tinge but I

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.600 
little bit of an orange tinge but I
think<00:05:52.160> my<00:05:52.250> hair<00:05:52.460> might<00:05:52.640> have<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:54.520> little<00:05:55.520> bit

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
think my hair might have a little bit

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.560 
think my hair might have a little bit
more<00:05:55.700> I<00:05:55.760> think<00:05:55.790> it's<00:05:56.030> gonna<00:05:56.180> make<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.480> a<00:05:56.510> lot

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
more I think it's gonna make it a lot

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.730 
more I think it's gonna make it a lot
easier<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:57.080> die<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:58.490> did<00:05:58.940> use<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.570> think<00:05:59.840> four

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
easier to die and I did use I think four

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.920 
easier to die and I did use I think four
or<00:06:00.980> five<00:06:01.250> different<00:06:01.970> chant<00:06:02.450> I<00:06:02.600> think<00:06:02.870> I

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
or five different chant I think I

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.990 
or five different chant I think I
shampooed<00:06:03.290> at<00:06:03.410> five<00:06:03.620> times<00:06:03.890> I<00:06:04.190> just<00:06:04.700> kind<00:06:04.910> of

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
shampooed at five times I just kind of

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.540 
shampooed at five times I just kind of
have<00:06:05.810> that<00:06:06.320> weird<00:06:06.560> smell<00:06:06.740> to<00:06:07.100> it<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.190> little<00:06:07.400> bit

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
have that weird smell to it a little bit

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.010 
have that weird smell to it a little bit
but<00:06:07.820> hopefully<00:06:07.970> no<00:06:08.300> one<00:06:08.390> will<00:06:08.420> be<00:06:08.540> sniffing<00:06:08.930> my

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
but hopefully no one will be sniffing my

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.290 
but hopefully no one will be sniffing my
hair<00:06:09.050> anytime<00:06:09.650> soon<00:06:09.950> so<00:06:10.550> yeah<00:06:10.880> that's<00:06:11.150> what<00:06:11.240> I

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300
