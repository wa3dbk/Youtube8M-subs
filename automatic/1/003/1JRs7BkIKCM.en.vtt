difference<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> distance<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:40.200> did<00:00:40.590> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
difference just the distance or did you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
swim better what was the deal there from

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.000 
swim better what was the deal there from
the<00:00:42.899> very<00:00:42.930> beginning<00:00:43.410> I've<00:00:43.530> always<00:00:43.710> been<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the very beginning I've always been a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
the very beginning I've always been a
200<00:00:44.430> swimmer<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.079> longer

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
200 swimmer I think it's just a longer

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.900 
200 swimmer I think it's just a longer
event<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> little

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
event so you can take it out a little

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.510 
event so you can take it out a little
bit<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.210> controlled<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.100> kind<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.219> work<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
bit more controlled and kind of work the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
bit more controlled and kind of work the
back<00:00:50.640> half<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.629> 100<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.920> off

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
back half we're in 100 it's just get off

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
back half we're in 100 it's just get off
the<00:00:53.160> blocks<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.820> fast<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.120> possible

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the blocks and go as fast as possible

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
the blocks and go as fast as possible
I've<00:00:54.960> heard<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> breaststroke<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I've heard that the breaststroke is the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
I've heard that the breaststroke is the
hardest<00:00:56.910> stroke<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.570> learn<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.469> true

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
hardest stroke to learn it is that true

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.529 
hardest stroke to learn it is that true
and<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.399> explain<00:00:59.550> why<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.449> bit

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and can you explain why and a little bit

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.119 
and can you explain why and a little bit
about<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> brush<00:01:01.050> room<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
about the brush room you know I think it

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
about the brush room you know I think it
is<00:01:02.160> hardest<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.789> learn<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.870> most

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
is hardest to learn it's the most

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.270 
is hardest to learn it's the most
natural<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:06.290> think<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> jokes<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
natural I think all this jokes kind of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
natural I think all this jokes kind of
find<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.700> instead<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.299> picking<00:01:09.540> which

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
