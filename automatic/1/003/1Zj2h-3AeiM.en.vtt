00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.990

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:25.000 

go<00:01:02.480> go<00:01:02.719> go<00:01:02.930> go

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.050 

yeah<00:01:26.010> we<00:01:26.250> should<00:01:26.460> next<00:01:27.090> time<00:01:27.690> we'll<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:29.060> said

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
yeah we should next time we'll have said

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200 
yeah we should next time we'll have said
it<00:01:30.210> before<00:01:30.300> huh

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 

but<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> start<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.070> pretty<00:01:35.310> even

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
but I think the start was pretty even

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.500 
but I think the start was pretty even
but<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:38.460> looks<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.150> faster<00:01:39.479> so

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
but it looks a little bit faster so

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.770 
but it looks a little bit faster so
let's<00:01:39.810> we'll<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.290> try<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:42.090> start<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.630> bit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
let's we'll just try to to start a bit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.570 
let's we'll just try to to start a bit
earlier<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.320> we'll<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.619> doing<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.190> go<00:01:44.340> slowly

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
earlier what we'll be doing we go slowly

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.720 
earlier what we'll be doing we go slowly
back

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:58.220
