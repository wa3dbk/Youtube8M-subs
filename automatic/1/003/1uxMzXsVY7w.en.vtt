sixteen<00:01:56.689> through<00:01:56.990> our<00:01:57.049> Pakistan<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:57.889> think

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
sixteen through our Pakistan so I think

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
sixteen through our Pakistan so I think
we're<00:01:58.490> majorly<00:01:58.700> stick<00:01:59.029> to<00:01:59.119> Karachi<00:01:59.389> Lord

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
we're majorly stick to Karachi Lord

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.300

slower<00:01:59.899> but<00:02:00.169> but<00:02:00.770> they're<00:02:01.009> gonna<00:02:01.130> be

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
slower but but they're gonna be

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.739

where young people are and stuff like

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.639 
where young people are and stuff like
that<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.029> um<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:05.749> we're<00:02:05.899> looking<00:02:06.200> for<00:02:06.380> only

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
that so um so we're looking for only

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.320 
that so um so we're looking for only
three<00:02:06.919> down<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:07.369> there's<00:02:07.549> lots<00:02:07.669> of<00:02:07.880> colleges

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
to go before the store is over I think

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.790 
to go before the store is over I think
the<00:02:10.849> idea<00:02:11.030> came<00:02:11.690> through<00:02:12.140> kind<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> idea

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800

youth these days don't
fresh<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.510> why<00:02:18.230> they<00:02:18.470> don't<00:02:18.680> kind<00:02:18.800> of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
fresh and and why they don't kind of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.680

to desperately be part of something like

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.440 
to desperately be part of something like
this<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.520> don't<00:03:07.550> have<00:03:07.760> an<00:03:07.880> outlet<00:03:08.180> for<00:03:08.240> it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
this you don't have an outlet for it

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.060 
this you don't have an outlet for it
they<00:03:08.780> were<00:03:08.840> happy<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.410> involved<00:03:09.710> they<00:03:09.980> were

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
they were happy to be involved they were

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.550 
they were happy to be involved they were
happy<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.460> talk<00:03:10.700> back<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.210> forth<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.840> us<00:03:11.990> but

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
happy to talk back and forth to us but

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.780 
happy to talk back and forth to us but
the<00:03:12.650> problem<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.160> they<00:03:13.280> don't<00:03:13.460> get<00:03:13.610> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the problem is that they don't get the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670 
the problem is that they don't get the
avenue<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.210> do<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.750> hopefully<00:03:15.110> apart

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
avenue to do that so hopefully apart

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.020 
avenue to do that so hopefully apart
from<00:03:15.740> this<00:03:15.920> will<00:03:16.070> be<00:03:16.190> back<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.520> teach<00:03:16.730> them<00:03:17.000> how

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
from this will be back to teach them how

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.700 
from this will be back to teach them how
to<00:03:17.150> do<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.630> know<00:03:17.750> right<00:03:17.960> now<00:03:18.140> we<00:03:18.620> were

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
to do this you know right now we were

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.080 
to do this you know right now we were
teaching<00:03:18.860> them<00:03:19.010> basically<00:03:19.490> but<00:03:19.700> hopefully<00:03:19.970> we

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
teaching them basically but hopefully we

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.470 
teaching them basically but hopefully we
can<00:03:20.240> take<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.570> step<00:03:20.600> further<00:03:20.960> later<00:03:21.290> on
