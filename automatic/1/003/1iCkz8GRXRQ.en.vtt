00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.109
 the end of jobs for the well-being industry 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.260
 the search for a healthier lifestyle 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.619
 the global economy is going through a radical change in nature the work 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.779
 with profound consequences for the future of society 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.710
 industrial diano classified human work coexist with the machines 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.100
 to produce basic goods and services 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.770
 at the airport santos 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.770
 machines in shape 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 quickly replaced the human workforce 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.450
 born in the port 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510
 for these services 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.870
 just as the industrial age put an end to slave labor 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 the era of access to the branch work 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.420
 father's day 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.480
 release successive generations of long hours of daily work 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 I make for the ration 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.120
 social networks 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.890
 we have a challenge before us 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.890
 to seek alternatives for me 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 whatever the alternative 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 disposition to rethink the madness 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.160
 the new formation in the attack 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 role of the society of the few to 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.760
 Faced with these facts, it is clear the need to rethink their projects 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.700
 professionals 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.850
 previously based almost exclusively small business enterprise 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.790
 or in the provision of services 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.960
 the question is 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.479
 what to do with the millions of young people 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.830
 that need to be pursued in a global economy 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.940
 increasingly automated 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.859
 What to do with women who wish to leave home 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.859
 to conquer your freedom your space in the market 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.559
 the same question is for executives 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.199
 what will they do when the job no longer exists 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.479
 and the elderly 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:20.279
 can still dream of a job opportunity and a social life 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.879
 more active 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.450
 to answer these and other questions I want to introduce a couple 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.770
 Of success 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.610
 what we perceive changes 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 and bet on the construction of a new business highly profitable and with a lot of 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.310
 quality of life are they 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.159
 Renata 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.420
 and Jorge Rivers 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.490
 they have been working for ten years with an activity that has made them one of the best 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.369
 successful businessmen 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.979
 Here in Brazil 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.609
 activity has nothing 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.510
 of the nine 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.519
 is based on three pillars 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.629
 the wellness industry multilevel marketing in one of the companies that most 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.360
 it seems in Brazil
