 hello to all I am delighted to you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.580
 find in this season for you 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.690
 introduce the buggy version of the lr ps10 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.890
 blast 2 and not any version 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.189
 since it is the most powerful 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.350
 never designed by the Germanic manufacturer 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.710
 capped with a brushless motor of 4300 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710
 square 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.559
 under his new slim body 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.050
 odious forms the east is big this beautiful 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.089
 blast 2 abric a mechanical focus 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 on performance 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.960
 this buggy version at scale 1 10th 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 with all-wheel drive and 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.769
 book is ready to go and adopts 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.659
 rolling trains similar to those of 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.699
 the second version skewer also 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.399
 available but provided with a simple 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.659
 charcoal engine electronic sounds of 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.489
 tip are among his best 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.290
 assets it relies on a new 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.479
 controller is the herpes king pro is 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.369
 spotted towards what remains compatible 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.800
 with engines up to 6 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.170
 for and a half at the center of the performances 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.539
 the engine is a cassette player from 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.660
 4300 kahn and tron ​​in position 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.860
 longitudinal at the rear of the chassis 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.479
 fully mounted this ball bearing 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.729
 with neodymium magnets 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.310
 this one is waiting its time to challenge the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.710
 stopwatch more he is already overwhelmed 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.300
 and fully connected to the controllers and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.490
 for optimal cooling 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.259
 the composite fiber frame of this 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.690
 version incorporates sweatshirts and the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.030
 rations under the engine cage and under 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.319
 the location reserved for the accused 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.289
 always when you make it easy 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.479
 the spin power controller is procrastinating 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.000
 a push button that works 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.039
 of switches appears this button 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.629
 duplicated because it also allows 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.520
 to navigate within the three modes of 

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:57.800
 programming provided by the interface 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.239
 of origin the three notes gives you the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.060
 ability to check compatibility 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.160
 of yours with the configuration of 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.840
 series then enable the function walk 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.420
 back or change the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.770
 characteristics of the motor sinn the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.780
 complete electronic part of a 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.610
 direction brain of 3 kg of torque to 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 plastic gears that comfort a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.410
 semi-aluminum case for good 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.330
 cool without motor we distinguish 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.650
 also under the novelties the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.750
 presence of a real compartments 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 sealed and to receive the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.200
 receiver of the installation 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.209
 perched on the platen that serves as against 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.220
 offer rocha site this housing life if in 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.569
 two parts hosts a receiver in 2 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.800
 gigas 4 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.390
 let's go back now to the running gear 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.660
 equally well off the side of 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.420
 the equipment the ps 10b xbl blast 2 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.830
 benefits from an effective suspension 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.770
 relies on shock absorbers 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.000
 edge of 15 mm diameter installed on 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.160
 very thick supports of almost a 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.380
 centimeter thick its shock absorbers 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.940
 may vary in three positions for 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.950
 change chassis roll 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.310
 and as lrp did not do things to 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.110
 half 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.000
 the cells also resume at this 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.480
 effect two stabilizer bars one 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 millimeter 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.310
 8 to perfect the handling of road to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.620
 the front the big is part of a brain spell 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.010
 adjustable in hardness and multiple vial 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.120
 is adjustable via steps inverted the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.460
 cell provided with a differentiate 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.650
 the comic future complement one another 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.050
 made of aluminum to stiffen 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.120
 fasteners of the suspension arms and 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.370
 articulated transmission gimbal which 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.340
 gives a maximum turning radius to 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.020
 during the operation at the back the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.959
 geometry also hosts tyrants 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.490
 of camber equipped with looted pines as well 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.800
 an adjustable anti-roll bar 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.690
 millimeter him while on the side of the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.970
 transmission two- wheeled rockets 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.580
 stay but no gimbal to boulgou 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.040
 ticket on the central part 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.410
 a straight aluminum gimbal makes sure 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.820
 connect the bridges 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.040
 last is connected to a tree with rigid 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.230
 equipped with a slip-on to limit the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.660
 wheel spinning traction is 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.090
 insured on his side by multi-tires 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.250
 narrow slats at the front and wider 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.980
 at the back to improve the holding of 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.989
 road on the bumpy terrain to make 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.910
 operate this auto you will need 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.190
 a VIP welcome to both aces of this

 its running gear with a report 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.210
 weight / power favorable to 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.540
