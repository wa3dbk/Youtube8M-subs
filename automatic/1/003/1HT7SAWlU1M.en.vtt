00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
troopers and whatnot but uh he would be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.139

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
of it's pretty simple that was

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.460 
of it's pretty simple that was
streamlined<00:03:33.209> silver<00:03:33.780> right<00:03:33.959> there<00:03:34.400> okay
