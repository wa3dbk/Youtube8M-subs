for the feet of the figure trying to
plug<00:02:34.350> those<00:02:34.530> pegs<00:02:34.860> into<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.130> stand<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.550> just

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
plug those pegs into the stand with just

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.780 
plug those pegs into the stand with just
your<00:02:36.030> hands<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.540> near<00:02:36.930> impossible<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.490> grab

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
your hands is near impossible so grab

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.660 
your hands is near impossible so grab
that<00:02:38.820> tool<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.570> came<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.990> them<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:41.370> tool

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
that tool that came with them this tool

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.060 
that tool that came with them this tool
makes<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.090> incredibly<00:02:42.630> easy<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.230> pop<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.800> pegs

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
makes it incredibly easy to pop the pegs

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.700 
makes it incredibly easy to pop the pegs
in<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:45.390> place<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> smaller<00:02:46.140> end<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> peg

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
in just place the smaller end of the peg

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.920 
in just place the smaller end of the peg
into<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> tool<00:02:47.340> pick<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.390> hole<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:48.870> to

use and give it a small push until the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.640 
use and give it a small push until the
peg<00:02:51.720> pops<00:02:52.110> into<00:02:52.410> place<00:02:53.330> simple<00:02:54.330> as<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
peg pops into place simple as that the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.470 
peg pops into place simple as that the
same<00:02:55.920> tool<00:02:56.130> can<00:02:56.370> also<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.700> used<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> pop<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
same tool can also be used to pop the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.670 
same tool can also be used to pop the
pegs<00:02:57.720> out<00:02:57.870> by<00:02:58.440> pushing<00:02:58.739> from<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.190> underside

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.990 

the<00:03:04.680> figures<00:03:05.040> feet<00:03:05.250> all<00:03:05.459> seem<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.700> plug

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the figures feet all seem to plug

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.690 
the figures feet all seem to plug
perfectly<00:03:06.660> onto<00:03:06.840> these<00:03:07.080> pegs<00:03:07.550> there<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
perfectly onto these pegs there is a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.790 
perfectly onto these pegs there is a
small<00:03:09.060> click<00:03:09.360> when<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.570> do<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.680> you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
small click when you do it and as you

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.830 
small click when you do it and as you
can<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.640> figure<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.120> held<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.570> stand

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
can see the figure is held to the stand

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.490 
can see the figure is held to the stand
pretty<00:03:13.200> well<00:03:13.440> by<00:03:13.620> those<00:03:13.830> small<00:03:14.190> little<00:03:14.220> pegs

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
pretty well by those small little pegs

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.720 
pretty well by those small little pegs
while<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.650> loose<00:03:16.800> joints<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.340> some<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
while the loose joints on some of the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.370 
while the loose joints on some of the
early<00:03:18.030> figures<00:03:18.420> may<00:03:18.630> still<00:03:18.900> cause<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
early figures may still cause the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.560 
early figures may still cause the
figures<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.769> fall<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> bit<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:21.269> stands

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
figures to fall down a bit the stands

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.300 
figures to fall down a bit the stands
most<00:03:21.870> definitely<00:03:22.590> helped<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.950> keep<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
most definitely helped to keep the

most definitely helped to keep the
figure<00:03:23.580> standing

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.570 

these<00:03:29.080> bases<00:03:29.530> are<00:03:29.620> also<00:03:29.800> shirt<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.490> they

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
these bases are also shirt so that they

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.790 
these bases are also shirt so that they

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.180 

overall<00:03:43.569> I'm<00:03:43.810> pretty<00:03:44.020> happy<00:03:44.170> with<00:03:44.650> these<00:03:44.860> I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
overall I'm pretty happy with these I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.970 
overall I'm pretty happy with these I
like<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.300> design<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.170> appreciate<00:03:47.770> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
like the design and I appreciate the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.059 
like the design and I appreciate the
ability<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.459> place<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:49.000> peg<00:03:49.209> anywhere<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.660> like

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
ability to place the peg anywhere I like

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.590 
ability to place the peg anywhere I like
the<00:03:51.069> only<00:03:51.250> issue<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.610> could<00:03:51.730> really<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.420> is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
the only issue I could really see is

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.420 
the only issue I could really see is
that<00:03:52.930> their<00:03:53.140> size<00:03:53.440> might<00:03:53.709> actually<00:03:53.920> take<00:03:54.250> up

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
that their size might actually take up

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.120 
that their size might actually take up
more<00:03:54.700> shelf<00:03:55.090> space<00:03:55.680> leaving<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.770> little<00:03:56.920> less

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
more shelf space leaving a little less

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.240 
more shelf space leaving a little less
room<00:03:57.340> for<00:03:57.370> actual<00:03:57.940> figures<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.769> they<00:03:59.890> do<00:03:59.950> make

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250
