moment<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.620> came<00:04:44.740> up<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.430> was<00:04:45.550> much<00:04:45.730> a

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
moment it came up so it was much a

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.540 
moment it came up so it was much a
framework<00:04:46.480> as<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:46.960> program<00:04:47.500> idea<00:04:47.920> did<00:04:48.430> you

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
framework as a program idea did you

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.950 
framework as a program idea did you
really<00:04:48.730> get<00:04:48.880> any<00:04:49.060> sense<00:04:49.390> that<00:04:49.600> this<00:04:49.690> was<00:04:49.840> going

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
really get any sense that this was going

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.540 
really get any sense that this was going
to<00:04:50.050> be<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.230> way<00:04:50.350> forward<00:04:50.650> for<00:04:50.890> 10<00:04:51.130> years<00:04:51.340> 20

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
to be the way forward for 10 years 20

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.680 
to be the way forward for 10 years 20
years<00:04:51.670> 40<00:04:52.540> years<00:04:52.570> well<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> think<00:04:54.060> earlier<00:04:55.060> I

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
years 40 years well I think earlier I

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.420 
years 40 years well I think earlier I
thought<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.320> grandstand<00:04:56.860> was<00:04:56.980> quite<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.220> good

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
thought the grandstand was quite a good

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.930 
thought the grandstand was quite a good
working<00:04:57.880> title<00:04:58.360> but<00:04:58.810> we've<00:04:59.110> still<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.380> change

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
working title but we've still a change

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.200 
working title but we've still a change
how<00:05:00.940> long<00:05:00.970> can<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.950> now<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:02.980> think<00:05:03.490> that<00:05:04.120> it

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
how long can you be now I think that it

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.750 
how long can you be now I think that it
was<00:05:04.330> very<00:05:04.570> obvious<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.590> once<00:05:06.040> we<00:05:06.280> got<00:05:06.520> it<00:05:06.640> off

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
was very obvious that once we got it off

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.200 
was very obvious that once we got it off
the<00:05:06.940> ground<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:07.920> David<00:05:08.920> joined<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:10.000> it

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
the ground and David joined it that it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.330 
the ground and David joined it that it
was<00:05:10.390> going<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.810> be<00:05:10.930> there<00:05:11.110> for<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.380> long<00:05:11.650> time<00:05:11.680> I

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
was going to be there for a long time I

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.370 
was going to be there for a long time I
couldn't<00:05:13.000> imagine<00:05:13.240> then<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.810> would<00:05:13.930> be<00:05:14.020> 40

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
couldn't imagine then it would be 40

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.950 
couldn't imagine then it would be 40
years<00:05:14.620> but<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.400> certainly<00:05:15.700> did<00:05:16.420> establish

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
years but it certainly did establish

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.410 
years but it certainly did establish
itself<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.560> think<00:05:17.770> was<00:05:17.920> gave<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.850> very<00:05:19.300> good

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
itself and I think was gave a very good

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.110 
itself and I think was gave a very good

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
that very first program pretty decent

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.610 
that very first program pretty decent

jumping<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.050> little<00:05:29.200> so<00:05:29.320> how<00:05:29.950> did<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.190> program

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
jumping a little so how did the program

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.660 
jumping a little so how did the program
go<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:31.510> way<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.750> went<00:05:31.870> quite<00:05:32.080> well<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.380> course

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
go the way it went quite well of course

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.040 
go the way it went quite well of course
nothing<00:05:33.670> ever<00:05:33.760> goes<00:05:34.030> right<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.360> first<00:05:34.540> time<00:05:34.780> I

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
nothing ever goes right the first time I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.840 
nothing ever goes right the first time I
think<00:05:35.170> that's<00:05:35.410> another<00:05:35.680> reason<00:05:35.920> why<00:05:36.190> Paul<00:05:36.520> and

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
think that's another reason why Paul and

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.910 
think that's another reason why Paul and
flattery<00:05:37.240> is<00:05:37.450> asked<00:05:37.900> me<00:05:38.230> to<00:05:38.380> introduce<00:05:38.590> it

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
flattery is asked me to introduce it

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.380 
flattery is asked me to introduce it
because<00:05:39.100> I<00:05:39.130> thought<00:05:39.250> well<00:05:39.460> if<00:05:39.790> it<00:05:39.970> goes<00:05:40.150> wrong

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
because I thought well if it goes wrong

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.110 
because I thought well if it goes wrong
do<00:05:40.900> Michael<00:05:41.080> have<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.440> carry<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.860> can<00:05:42.040> but<00:05:42.730> no

David I think I I have a sight slight

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.490 
David I think I I have a sight slight
sense<00:06:27.430> of<00:06:27.580> regret<00:06:27.760> that<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.750> BBC<00:06:29.020> couldn't

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
sense of regret that the BBC couldn't

to<00:06:31.450> keep<00:06:31.870> some<00:06:32.110> of<00:06:32.140> the<00:06:32.320> main

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
to keep some of the main

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.830 
to keep some of the main
events<00:06:33.010> but<00:06:33.220> but<00:06:33.700> think<00:06:34.090> the<00:06:34.240> core<00:06:34.510> of<00:06:34.540> the

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
events but but think the core of the

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.170 
events but but think the core of the
program<00:06:35.050> is<00:06:35.410> there<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:36.190> presenters<00:06:36.790> save

your modesty that the presenters are
still<00:06:39.550> first-class<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:40.540> think<00:06:40.990> they've<00:06:41.139> all

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
still first-class I think they've all

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.050 
still first-class I think they've all
carried<00:06:41.770> on<00:06:41.919> from<00:06:42.220> David's<00:06:42.639> original

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
carried on from David's original

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.600 
carried on from David's original
tradition<00:06:43.480> and<00:06:43.690> I<00:06:44.530> find<00:06:44.919> very<00:06:45.010> little<00:06:45.280> to

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
tradition and I find very little to

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.760 
tradition and I find very little to
fault<00:06:45.850> except<00:06:46.419> the<00:06:46.570> lack<00:06:46.720> of<00:06:46.900> some<00:06:47.200> big<00:06:47.410> events

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
fault except the lack of some big events

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.230 
fault except the lack of some big events
with<00:06:48.190> those<00:06:48.400> words<00:06:48.669> I<00:06:48.850> think<00:06:49.030> you've<00:06:49.120> earned

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
with those words I think you've earned

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.850 
with those words I think you've earned
yourself<00:06:49.690> a<00:06:49.780> very<00:06:49.900> decent<00:06:50.200> lunch<00:06:50.530> of<00:06:50.740> there
