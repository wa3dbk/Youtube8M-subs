00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.830 

so<00:00:56.310> let's<00:00:56.489> take<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> look<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.150> sentence<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
so let's take a look at the sentence the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380 
so let's take a look at the sentence the
sentence<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> built<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.370> period<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
phrase and the continuation phrase

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
phrase and the continuation phrase
unlike<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> period<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.510> presentation

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

phrase is built from a basic idea and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.900 
phrase is built from a basic idea and
then<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> repetition<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> basic<00:01:11.220> idea<00:01:11.550> we

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
then a repetition of the basic idea we

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.219

response the first is just as it sounds
it's<00:01:24.180> an<00:01:24.390> exact<00:01:24.750> copy<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> basic<00:01:25.890> idea

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it's an exact copy of the basic idea

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
it's an exact copy of the basic idea
frequently<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.149> exact<00:01:27.570> repetition<00:01:27.899> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
frequently this exact repetition is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
frequently this exact repetition is
varied<00:01:28.800> slightly<00:01:29.040> by<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> change<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.330> texture

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
varied slightly by a change in texture

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.499 
varied slightly by a change in texture
or<00:01:31.080> dynamics<00:01:31.830> but<00:01:32.460> most<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.910> time<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
or dynamics but most of the time the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.719 
or dynamics but most of the time the
melody<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> harmony<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.100> changed

listen<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.390> example<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:37.080> exact

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
listen to this example of exact

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.680 
listen to this example of exact
repetition<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:38.759> varies<00:01:39.149> slightly<00:01:39.450> with

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
repetition that varies slightly with

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:50.310 
repetition that varies slightly with
dynamics<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.619> texture

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.440 

the<00:01:51.320> second<00:01:51.740> type<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:51.950> repetition<00:01:52.760> is<00:01:52.910> model

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the second type of repetition is model

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.630 
the second type of repetition is model
sequence<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.770> done<00:01:54.980> by<00:01:55.130> directly

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
sequence this is done by directly

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.910 
sequence this is done by directly
transposing<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.750> basic<00:01:57.110> idea<00:01:57.500> into<00:01:57.890> a

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
transposing the basic idea into a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.950 
transposing the basic idea into a
neighboring<00:01:58.310> harmony<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.570> isn't<00:01:59.870> very

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
neighboring harmony this isn't very

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.810 
neighboring harmony this isn't very
common<00:02:00.440> in<00:02:00.530> presentation<00:02:01.160> phrases<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
common in presentation phrases and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.460 
common in presentation phrases and
happens<00:02:02.240> most<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.630> time<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:02.990> continuation

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
happens most of time in the continuation

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.470 
happens most of time in the continuation
phrase<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.580> we're<00:02:04.730> going<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.940> look<00:02:05.060> at<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.300> in

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
phrase so we're going to look at this in

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.940 
phrase so we're going to look at this in
just<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.720> little<00:02:05.750> bit<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.410> third<00:02:06.680> type<00:02:06.920> of

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
just a little bit the third type of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.310 
just a little bit the third type of
repetition<00:02:07.730> statement<00:02:08.510> response<00:02:08.990> is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
repetition statement response is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.350 
repetition statement response is
probably<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.010> most<00:02:10.160> common<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:10.910> let's<00:02:11.120> take<00:02:11.330> a

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
probably the most common so let's take a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.270 
probably the most common so let's take a
look<00:02:11.540> at<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.840> statement<00:02:12.320> response<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
look at that statement response is the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.070 
look at that statement response is the
type<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.490> repetition<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.420> changes<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
type of repetition that changes the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.350 
type of repetition that changes the
underlying<00:02:15.620> harmony<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.730> keeps<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> same

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
underlying harmony but keeps the same

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.780 
underlying harmony but keeps the same
melodic<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.110> motivic<00:02:18.590> content<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.550> we

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
melodic and motivic content just like we

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.010 
melodic and motivic content just like we
learned<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.180> lesson<00:02:20.570> two

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
learned in lesson two

to someone and you wanted to know where
store<00:02:57.560> was<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.370> would<00:02:58.519> say<00:02:58.670> something<00:02:58.940> like

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
store was you would say something like

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.930 
store was you would say something like
hey<00:02:59.840> where's<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.410> story<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.459> other<00:03:01.489> person

with the presentation phrase explained
let's<00:03:48.290> move<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.890> continuation<00:03:49.370> phrase

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
let's move on to the continuation phrase

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.940 
let's move on to the continuation phrase
the<00:03:50.330> continuation<00:03:50.810> phrase<00:03:51.350> has<00:03:51.560> several

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
the continuation phrase has several

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.040 
the continuation phrase has several
defining<00:03:52.550> characteristics<00:03:53.390> there's<00:03:53.900> an

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
defining characteristics there's an

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.440 
defining characteristics there's an
acceleration<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.010> harmonic<00:03:55.520> rhythm<00:03:55.730> this

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
acceleration of the harmonic rhythm this

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.120 
acceleration of the harmonic rhythm this
means<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.959> chords<00:03:57.350> change<00:03:57.739> more

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
means that the chords change more

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.979 
means that the chords change more
frequently<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.970> illustrate<00:03:59.480> look<00:03:59.750> at<00:03:59.840> this

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
frequently to illustrate look at this

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.530 
frequently to illustrate look at this
example<00:04:00.350> in<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:01.040> presentation<00:04:01.730> phrase<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
example in the presentation phrase you

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.380 
example in the presentation phrase you
have<00:04:02.750> one<00:04:03.080> chord<00:04:03.470> for<00:04:03.709> every<00:04:04.160> two<00:04:04.370> bars<00:04:04.610> this

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
have one chord for every two bars this

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.940 
have one chord for every two bars this
is<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.720> harmonic<00:04:06.050> rhythm<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
is the harmonic rhythm in the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.590 
is the harmonic rhythm in the
continuation<00:04:07.400> phrase<00:04:07.910> on<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.180> other<00:04:08.330> hand

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
continuation phrase on the other hand

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.410 
continuation phrase on the other hand
there<00:04:09.140> is<00:04:09.320> one<00:04:09.620> chord<00:04:09.980> per<00:04:10.190> bar<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.300> an

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
there is one chord per bar so this is an

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:27.530 
there is one chord per bar so this is an
acceleration<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.530> harmonic<00:04:13.010> rhythm

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.500 

you

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.750 

another<00:04:31.260> defining<00:04:31.770> characteristic<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.700> a
