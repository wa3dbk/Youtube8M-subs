00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.829
 at the beginning of August 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.119
 get here 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.659
 peter siemsen 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:12.510
 let's go 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.479
 in a whirlwind 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.489
 michael schumacher thinks he regretted the away team 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.880
 is what the study 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 we stayed 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.550
 we deserve 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.390
 the central bank 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.960
 this sensation 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 The other amendment provides for compensation despite not announcing that the plan 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 career 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.130
 they were located 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.590
 he has the French created opportunities 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 enough left over for Marian on the side 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.390
 lost because the maps 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.980
 - Tuesday 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.860
 even playing at home 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 they were first aid charged a fee 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.600
 the problem with circulatory but I think it is entirely fair 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.250
 without doing a show in the river because even because my dress 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.500
 because today we are one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.750
 the visitor 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.090
 lost the last three years 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 If that happen 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.000
 we are 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 for over an hour 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 more than in April 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.880
 even so 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.940
 the body of the victim 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.430
 another actor from 2015 onwards in a game are different and never 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.860
 in the southeast region the sun predominates in the parana 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 I therefore stopped publicly 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.710
 I believe we have to have attitude towards 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.900
 I am 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.980
 some jobs 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.400
 in the prism that suffers more risks 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.710
 with work and employment
