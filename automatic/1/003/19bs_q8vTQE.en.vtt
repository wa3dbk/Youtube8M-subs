00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:34.552
[GISA] This is my first book,
I'm a journalist,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.007
and I worked on this project
for 5 years.

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:40.332
It's an honor to be Pepe's daughter,

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.111
he's my father,

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:46.578
and since I was a little kid
I used to see everyone greeting him,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.029
hugging him,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.133
and I used to ask him
where he met all those people,

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:53.560
but he didn't even know them.

00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:55.688
[PEPE] It's a different emotion,

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:02.462
it reminds me of the goals I scored,

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:04.449
the victories, the achievements,

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:09.170
and now I'm sharing
that happiness with my daughter.

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:12.694
She did a wonderful job,

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:16.046
it's a 250-page book,
which tells her father's history,

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:17.781
as well as her family's.

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:19.545
[PEPINHO] I'm extremely thrilled,

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:23.541
I'm very proud to have
such a wonderful father,

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.100
and now his victorious history
is being told...

00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:28.334
by my sister,

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:30.610
I'm very proud of her,

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.932
and I'm proud she's the one
responsible for this biography,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.586
she did a wonderful job.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.818
[JOSÃ‰] We've been working on this book
for some years,

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:57.819
Gisa Macia had always wanted
to write about her father,

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:03.031
but solemnly,
as a journalist,

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:04.566
and she prepared herself to do that.

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:07.964
When she talked to me
about her wish,

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:12.051
I thought it'd add
even more value to the project,

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:17.279
everyone knows
what Pepe did for soccer,

00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:23.617
and to have a biography written
by his daughter is amazing.

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:25.589
[GISA] There are stories from when
he played for Santos FC,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.353
they were a real family,

00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:30.118
they played for the same team
for several years,

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.991
they had a really strong friendship.

00:02:34.312 --> 00:02:36.120
[PEPE] I worked in Portugal,

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.066
Arabia, Peru,

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:39.723
and Japan,

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:43.644
and the book tells
many interesting and funny facts...

00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:45.641
from those times.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.692
[MODESTO] Pepe's biography tells,

00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:13.442
in a wonderful way,
a little bit about Santos FC's history.

00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:16.280
[GISA] As his daughter,
I wanted to give him this present,

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:18.894
he turned 80 this year,

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:22.195
especially  after
several interviews with him,

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:24.148
he has a great memory.

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:28.898
[PEPINHO] Not only Santos FC fans
should read this book,

00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:33.286
everyone should read it,
it's wonderful.
