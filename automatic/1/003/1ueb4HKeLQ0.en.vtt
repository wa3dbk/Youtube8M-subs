okay<00:00:06.250> we're<00:00:06.430> here<00:00:06.640> at<00:00:06.960> image<00:00:07.960> stabilization

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
okay we're here at image stabilization

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.730 
okay we're here at image stabilization
for<00:00:09.549> the<00:00:09.820> Leica<00:00:10.540> x1<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:14.080> is<00:00:14.290> only<00:00:14.469> from

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
for the Leica x1 and this is only from

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.980 
for the Leica x1 and this is only from
what<00:00:14.950> I<00:00:14.980> read<00:00:15.250> but<00:00:15.490> what<00:00:16.000> I<00:00:16.029> read<00:00:16.330> was<00:00:16.360> the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
what I read but what I read was the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.130 
what I read but what I read was the
image<00:00:17.380> stabilization<00:00:17.860> works<00:00:18.430> this<00:00:18.640> way<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
image stabilization works this way of

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.720 
image stabilization works this way of
course<00:00:20.350> sorry<00:00:20.710> let<00:00:20.920> me<00:00:21.010> backtrack<00:00:21.220> here

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
course sorry let me backtrack here

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.230 
course sorry let me backtrack here
there's<00:00:22.000> no<00:00:22.529> optically<00:00:23.529> stabilized<00:00:24.400> lens<00:00:24.670> on

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
there's no optically stabilized lens on

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.310 
there's no optically stabilized lens on
this<00:00:25.630> camera

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
this camera

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this camera
there's<00:00:26.949> no<00:00:27.269> sensor<00:00:28.269> based<00:00:29.220> stabilization<00:00:30.220> on

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
there's no sensor based stabilization on

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.000 
there's no sensor based stabilization on
this<00:00:30.460> camera<00:00:30.730> so<00:00:31.210> now<00:00:32.050> what<00:00:32.260> I've<00:00:32.379> read<00:00:32.650> they

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
this camera so now what I've read they

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.040 
this camera so now what I've read they
what<00:00:33.730> they've<00:00:33.879> done<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.300> when<00:00:34.930> you're

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
what they've done is when you're

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.459 
what they've done is when you're
shooting<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:36.070> takes<00:00:36.399> two<00:00:36.670> photos<00:00:37.260> one<00:00:38.260> right

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
shooting it takes two photos one right

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.590 
shooting it takes two photos one right
after<00:00:38.620> another<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:39.309> it<00:00:39.850> blends<00:00:40.149> those<00:00:40.360> two

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
after another and it blends those two

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.959 
after another and it blends those two
somehow<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.469> create<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:43.829> stable<00:00:44.969> stabilized

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
somehow to create a stable stabilized

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.030 
somehow to create a stable stabilized
picture<00:00:46.660> I<00:00:46.870> don't<00:00:47.320> know<00:00:47.379> how<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.649> works<00:00:47.829> I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
picture I don't know how it works I

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.670 
picture I don't know how it works I
haven't<00:00:48.280> tested<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.670> perhaps<00:00:49.539> in<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.260> few<00:00:50.289> more

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
haven't tested it perhaps in a few more

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.500 
haven't tested it perhaps in a few more
reviews<00:00:50.860> with<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.760> little<00:00:52.030> more<00:00:52.149> use<00:00:52.270> of<00:00:52.300> the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
reviews with a little more use of the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.209 
reviews with a little more use of the
camera<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.989> will<00:00:53.230> spend<00:00:53.500> some<00:00:53.559> time<00:00:53.680> testing

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
camera I will spend some time testing

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.970

firmware<00:04:11.390> version<00:04:11.959> 1.0<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.180> use<00:04:14.180> your

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.490 
firmware version 1.0 and use your
profile<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:14.989> have<00:04:15.110> three<00:04:15.380> different

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
simple that is one of the reasons I was

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.879 
simple that is one of the reasons I was
attracted<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.200> it's<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> very<00:04:52.500> good<00:04:52.620> looking

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
attracted to it it's a very good looking

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.760 
attracted to it it's a very good looking
camera<00:04:53.450> physically<00:04:54.450> besides<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.230> excellent

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
camera physically besides the excellent

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.290 
camera physically besides the excellent
shooting<00:04:56.010> capabilities<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:56.760> looks<00:04:56.940> very<00:04:57.150> good

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
shooting capabilities it looks very good

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.450 
shooting capabilities it looks very good
and<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:58.470> reason<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:58.800> looks<00:04:58.860> very<00:04:59.100> good<00:04:59.340> is

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
and the reason it looks very good is

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.690 
and the reason it looks very good is
because<00:04:59.669> it<00:04:59.970> doesn't<00:05:00.270> have<00:05:00.479> an<00:05:01.350> ISO<00:05:01.950> knob<00:05:02.250> and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
because it doesn't have an ISO knob and

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.510 
because it doesn't have an ISO knob and
and<00:05:02.940> several<00:05:03.450> preset<00:05:03.960> modes<00:05:04.290> up<00:05:04.560> here<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:05.040> has

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
and several preset modes up here it has

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.010 
and several preset modes up here it has
a<00:05:05.550> aperture<00:05:06.919> dial<00:05:07.919> it<00:05:08.820> has<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.600> shutter<00:05:09.870> speed

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
a aperture dial it has a shutter speed

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.379 
a aperture dial it has a shutter speed
dial<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.889> a<00:05:11.070> release<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.700> there's<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.120> flash

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
dial and a release and there's a flash

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.379 
dial and a release and there's a flash
there<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.169> very<00:05:13.350> simple<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.729> is<00:05:14.970> at<00:05:15.210> the

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
there it is very simple so it is at the

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.200 
there it is very simple so it is at the
bottom<00:05:15.570> if<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.139> want<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.710> preset<00:05:17.280> some

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
bottom if you want to preset some

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.570 
bottom if you want to preset some
different<00:05:18.750> profiles<00:05:19.200> have<00:05:19.860> at<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.190> but<00:05:20.340> you<00:05:20.430> do

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
different profiles have at it but you do

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.969 
different profiles have at it but you do
have<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:20.910> get<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.210> it<00:05:21.360> through<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.440> menu

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
have to get to it through the the menu

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.710 
have to get to it through the the menu
system<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:24.180> I'm<00:05:24.300> sure<00:05:24.450> you<00:05:24.540> could<00:05:24.690> probably

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
system and I'm sure you could probably

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.140 
system and I'm sure you could probably
work<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.290> out<00:05:25.470> within<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.430> couple<00:05:26.610> days<00:05:26.820> used

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
work that out within a couple days used

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.960 
work that out within a couple days used
to<00:05:27.300> get<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.570> it<00:05:27.690> pretty<00:05:27.810> quickly
