00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the beginning it's pretty easy and as

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
the beginning it's pretty easy and as
you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.500> see<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.340> don't<00:01:32.549> die<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.030> long

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
