00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.540
 and today use that was always a trucker but a year ago he solved 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.769
 to invest in milk production in the driver profession he remained 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.769
 even buy would be from the secretary in lucas of the green river where they are created 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.170
 heifers and ten defeats if Jose still has a job 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.760
 while the property is touched by the wife and two children 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.119
 milk production at the outset he says that the conditions were 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.239
 very precarious it only managed to produce 30 liters of milk a day 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.490
 It's not because I bought it that I had nothing. 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.730
 clean earth 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.730
 I started working quiet paston 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.710
 about 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
 and I started doing the shed 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.130
 I started doing it there 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.450
 though well 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.000
 another carrying smoke working yesterday invested 22 thousand reais in equipment 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.429
 and became cooperative of cooagril 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.689
 agricultural and industrial cooperative formed in the municipality for 11 years 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.470
 today the family is 60 and 70 liters of milk per day 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.450
 following the standards of hygiene standardization the milk has certain destination 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.490
 the cooperative pays 53 cents per liter on average two thousand nine hundred 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.990
 real monthly gives more who enters family budget 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.820
 with the gains of milk production Senhor Jose managed to buy 28 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.920
 Livestock heads raise chicken to grow vegetable garden on other 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.100
 subsistence 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.620
 a year from home 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 changed that I grew euros 70% 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.800
 of the time I started 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.990
 because I have started I had three animals 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.260
 and I'm 28 today 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.109
 through the cooperative of the producers receive technical assistance 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.039
 have access to the technology to guarantee the purchase of the product and 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.619
 when they have the documentation up to date they still get bank credit 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.099
 incentive to family farming 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.970
 two hundred and seventy-eight families that are registered in the basin project 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:20.230
 each of which employs on average three 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.230
 family the agent is this sector tends to grow 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.179
 a lot because we are in a region 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.209
 the new frontiers boundary sector will finally have a characteristic 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.810
 that the ones that do not need to be deforested more to produce more milk take advantage of the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.620
 that already exists of available area and in small areas and makes possible both aa 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.820
 production of the small producer and the pro-family as well as the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.700
 activities that enable the diversification of large properties 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.610
 this property has capacity for 50 stalls producing 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.029
 today there are 12 expectations of adjusting 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.689
 up to a year from now, he may have at least 35 stalls producing what is 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.489
 which is worth about 600 meters of milk per day 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.969
 and if he can not get funding for the purchase of dairy cows already 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.040
 you have another alternative but you'll have to wait a little bit longer 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.579
 if I could not 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.279
 it's late he's more animals 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.199
 through financing 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.349
 It's Friday that's going to be producing here two years. I'm going to produce 600 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.539
 liters per day 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:35.879
 by God's will 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.129
 quality of life has changed a lot 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.909
 the quality of life 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.779
 here to 100 percent to strike that the city 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:43.249
 100%
