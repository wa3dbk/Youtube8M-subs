starting<00:00:33.140> off<00:00:33.200> with<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.410> see<00:00:33.649> this<00:00:34.309> is<00:00:34.460> kind<00:00:34.670> of

starting off with a see this is kind of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.900 
starting off with a see this is kind of
like<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.480> verse

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.350 

mute<00:00:38.910> 3<00:00:39.410> 2010<00:00:42.590> all<00:00:43.590> right<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.150> we<00:00:45.240> go

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
mute 3 2010 all right so and then we go

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.540 
mute 3 2010 all right so and then we go
to<00:00:45.390> achieve

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
to achieve

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.580 
to achieve
32<00:00:47.420> 00<00:00:47.719> 33

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
32 00 33

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.570 
32 00 33
then<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.740> an<00:00:51.890> F<00:00:52.900> mute<00:00:53.900> 0<00:00:54.500> 3<00:00:54.860> 2<00:00:55.160> 1<00:00:55.760> 1<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:57.830> then

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
then to an F mute 0 3 2 1 1 and then

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.950 
then to an F mute 0 3 2 1 1 and then
back<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.880> that<00:00:59.000> G

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
back to that G

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.939

to<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.510> app

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
to the app

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.140 
to the app
to<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:42.900> G

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.320 

to<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> steep<00:01:48.330> such<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.840> G

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.270 

when<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.810> your<00:01:53.230> snap

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.210 

so<00:02:00.000> we're<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> cutting<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:01.170> half

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
so we're kind of cutting that in half

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.670 
so we're kind of cutting that in half
and<00:02:03.730> then<00:02:03.910> we<00:02:04.210> kick<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.510> into<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.930> chorus<00:02:05.320> with

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
and then we kick it into the chorus with

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.450 
and then we kick it into the chorus with
a<00:02:05.710> d<00:02:05.950> minor<00:02:06.240> mute<00:02:08.310> 0023<00:02:09.310> one<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:11.410> tell<00:02:11.590> me

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.479 

okay<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.650> just<00:02:17.799> going<00:02:17.980> between<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.370> D

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
okay so it's just going between that D

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.120 
okay so it's just going between that D
minor<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.090> sea<00:02:19.299> for<00:02:19.629> now

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
minor and the sea for now

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.040 
minor and the sea for now
it's<00:02:21.670> not<00:02:21.880> what<00:02:22.240> time

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.120 

they<00:02:27.050> go<00:02:27.170> through<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.380> see<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.100> a

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
they go through that see just for a

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.190 
they go through that see just for a
second<00:02:28.700> before<00:02:29.090> they<00:02:29.360> transition<00:02:29.990> into<00:02:30.050> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
second before they transition into the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.370 
second before they transition into the
second<00:02:30.620> line<00:02:30.710> of<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.890> course<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.640> can't<00:02:31.880> tell

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380

and that's it so all the time

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.790 
and that's it so all the time
all<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.840> way

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.620 

and<00:04:40.800> then<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.730> kicks<00:04:41.910> into<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.390> whole

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
and then it kicks into this whole

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.510 
and then it kicks into this whole
interlude<00:04:43.140> solo<00:04:43.500> type<00:04:43.830> thing<00:04:44.070> we're<00:04:44.250> just

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
interlude solo type thing we're just

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.460 

I<00:04:50.119> think<00:04:51.119> it<00:04:51.180> might<00:04:51.270> be<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.419> little<00:04:51.539> bit

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.400 

and<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:55.850> just<00:04:56.540> between<00:04:56.660> those<00:04:56.900> effing<00:04:57.170> sea<00:04:57.290> at

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
and so just between those effing sea at

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.780 
and so just between those effing sea at
the<00:04:57.440> effing<00:04:57.710> sea<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.040> guitar<00:04:58.130> solo<00:04:58.520> and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
the effing sea for the guitar solo and

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.090 
the effing sea for the guitar solo and
then<00:04:59.450> you<00:04:59.660> kick<00:04:59.810> into<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.080> final<00:05:00.560> chorus<00:05:00.830> which

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
then you kick into a final chorus which

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.240 
then you kick into a final chorus which
is<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.280> little<00:05:01.730> bit<00:05:02.420> different<00:05:02.960> right<00:05:03.250> it's

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
is a little bit different right it's

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.690 
is a little bit different right it's
gonna<00:05:04.400> be<00:05:04.610> you<00:05:05.390> can't<00:05:05.920> so<00:05:06.920> it<00:05:07.040> goes<00:05:07.190> from<00:05:07.400> A<00:05:07.520> D

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
gonna be you can't so it goes from A D

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.040 
gonna be you can't so it goes from A D
minor<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:11.540> he<00:05:11.630> goes<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:11.930> G<00:05:12.200> right

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
minor and he goes to a G right

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.360 
minor and he goes to a G right

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.600 
do
so<00:05:17.330> they<00:05:17.419> do<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:17.960> twice<00:05:18.139> you<00:05:18.290> can't<00:05:18.500> tell

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
so they do that twice you can't tell

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.820 
so they do that twice you can't tell
it's<00:05:19.819> not<00:05:20.000> worth<00:05:20.330> fighting<00:05:20.689> for<00:05:21.500> try<00:05:22.009> for<00:05:22.340> me

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830
