when<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.210> go<00:04:54.330> two<00:04:54.480> edges<00:04:54.720> building<00:04:55.080> do<00:04:55.230> not

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
when you go two edges building do not

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.340 
when you go two edges building do not
jump<00:04:55.830> off<00:04:56.010> or<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.700> will<00:04:56.880> die<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:58.020> just<00:04:58.200> need

jump off or you will die you just need
to<00:04:58.440> fall<00:04:58.740> off<00:04:58.980> so<00:04:59.370> just<00:04:59.490> walk<00:04:59.730> off<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.240> edge

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
to fall off so just walk off the edge

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.020 
to fall off so just walk off the edge
because<00:05:00.870> if<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:01.560> jump<00:05:01.890> you'll<00:05:02.100> die<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.670> if

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
because if you jump you'll die and if

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.580 
because if you jump you'll die and if
you<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.240> fall<00:05:03.450> off<00:05:03.480> your<00:05:03.870> health<00:05:04.050> lowers<00:05:04.440> all

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
you just fall off your health lowers all

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.350 
you just fall off your health lowers all
the<00:05:04.770> way<00:05:05.180> we're<00:05:06.180> almost<00:05:06.300> all<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.570> way<00:05:08.150> so<00:05:09.150> do

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
the way we're almost all the way so do

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.960 
the way we're almost all the way so do
not<00:05:09.510> jump<00:05:13.040> then<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.280> just<00:05:14.460> follow<00:05:14.760> this

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
not jump then you just follow this

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:22.340 
not jump then you just follow this
bridge<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.660> very<00:05:15.930> end<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:21.200> then<00:05:22.200> there's

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
bridge to the very end and then there's

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.140 
bridge to the very end and then there's
a<00:05:22.440> huge<00:05:22.740> gap<00:05:22.800> up<00:05:23.250> here<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.640> you<00:05:23.700> need<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:23.940> go<00:05:24.090> to

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
a huge gap up here and you need to go to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.700 
a huge gap up here and you need to go to
your<00:05:24.360> right<00:05:24.510> moored<00:05:24.900> where<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.290> can't<00:05:25.530> like

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
your right moored where you can't like

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.430 
your right moored where you can't like
see<00:05:25.980> it<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:27.240> means<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.630> land<00:05:27.870> right<00:05:28.230> there

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
see it that means the land right there

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.350 
see it that means the land right there
is<00:05:28.530> overlapping<00:05:29.190> so<00:05:29.550> then<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.790> jump<00:05:30.030> there

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
is overlapping so then you jump there

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.030 
is overlapping so then you jump there
because<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.110> don't<00:05:31.260> want<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.440> jump<00:05:31.620> into<00:05:31.740> that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
because you don't want to jump into that

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.200 
because you don't want to jump into that
gap<00:05:32.220> because<00:05:32.460> you'll<00:05:32.580> fall<00:05:32.760> underneath<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
gap because you'll fall underneath the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:41.970 
gap because you'll fall underneath the
map<00:05:33.390> and<00:05:33.570> die

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.460 

so<00:05:42.610> getting<00:05:42.790> on<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.120> bridge<00:05:43.330> nothing<00:05:43.930> you

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
so getting on the bridge nothing you

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.020 
so getting on the bridge nothing you
won't<00:05:44.620> die<00:05:44.710> or<00:05:44.860> anything<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:46.680> it's<00:05:47.850> it<00:05:48.850> would

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
won't die or anything and it's it would

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.920 
won't die or anything and it's it would
be<00:05:49.180> a<00:05:49.210> cool<00:05:49.420> sniping<00:05:49.870> spot<00:05:50.110> but<00:05:50.470> unless<00:05:51.160> you

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
be a cool sniping spot but unless you

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.030 
be a cool sniping spot but unless you
some<00:05:52.930> of<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.110> guys<00:05:53.260> like<00:05:53.470> on<00:05:53.650> top<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.980> the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
some of the guys like on top of the

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.100 
some of the guys like on top of the
buildings<00:05:54.430> or<00:05:54.730> there<00:05:55.090> in<00:05:55.240> view<00:05:55.540> and<00:05:55.750> not<00:05:55.900> like

buildings or there in view and not like

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.870 
buildings or there in view and not like
because<00:05:56.770> from<00:05:56.950> back<00:05:57.100> here<00:05:57.340> you<00:05:57.550> can<00:05:57.730> see

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
because from back here you can see

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.690 
because from back here you can see
through<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.330> buildings<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.520> only<00:06:00.520> way

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
through the buildings and the only way

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.860 
through the buildings and the only way
you'd<00:06:00.850> be<00:06:00.880> able<00:06:00.970> to<00:06:01.150> snipe<00:06:01.390> them<00:06:01.570> as<00:06:01.720> if

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
you'd be able to snipe them as if

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.330 
you'd be able to snipe them as if
they're<00:06:02.200> like<00:06:02.380> on<00:06:02.530> top<00:06:02.800> of<00:06:02.890> the<00:06:02.950> buildings<00:06:03.220> or

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
they're like on top of the buildings or

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.010 
they're like on top of the buildings or
something<00:06:03.670> to<00:06:03.850> wear<00:06:04.030> you<00:06:04.450> don't<00:06:04.600> have<00:06:04.780> to<00:06:04.900> like

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
something to wear you don't have to like

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.690 
something to wear you don't have to like
shoot<00:06:05.200> through<00:06:05.410> a<00:06:05.440> wall<00:06:05.650> otherwise<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:06.460> won't

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
shoot through a wall otherwise it won't

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.080 
shoot through a wall otherwise it won't
work<00:06:10.920> so<00:06:11.920> i'll<00:06:12.010> show<00:06:12.190> you<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.460> you<00:06:12.520> can<00:06:12.670> see

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
work so i'll show you that you can see

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.240 
work so i'll show you that you can see
through<00:06:13.420> the<00:06:13.510> building<00:06:13.870> if<00:06:14.830> you<00:06:14.920> look<00:06:15.070> at<00:06:15.190> the

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
through the building if you look at the

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.970 
through the building if you look at the
top<00:06:15.490> screen<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:16.180> can<00:06:16.390> see<00:06:16.660> him<00:06:16.870> jumping<00:06:17.830> up

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
top screen you can see him jumping up

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.640 
top screen you can see him jumping up
and<00:06:18.100> down<00:06:18.660> it's<00:06:19.660> kind<00:06:19.780> of<00:06:19.870> hard<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.110> see<00:06:20.350> but

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
and down it's kind of hard to see but

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.280 
and down it's kind of hard to see but
i'll<00:06:20.770> put<00:06:20.980> the<00:06:21.100> scope<00:06:21.370> up<00:06:24.480> and<00:06:25.480> as<00:06:25.750> you<00:06:25.900> see<00:06:26.080> it

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
i'll put the scope up and as you see it

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.720 
i'll put the scope up and as you see it
doesn't<00:06:26.620> do<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.040> thing<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.430> him<00:06:27.520> because<00:06:27.700> of

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
doesn't do the thing to him because of

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.530 
doesn't do the thing to him because of
the<00:06:27.850> building<00:06:28.240> he's<00:06:28.840> looking<00:06:29.170> at<00:06:29.290> a<00:06:29.320> building

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
the building he's looking at a building

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:43.580 
the building he's looking at a building
when<00:06:31.540> i'm<00:06:31.660> looking<00:06:31.990> right<00:06:32.050> through<00:06:32.170> it

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.500 

so<00:06:44.190> it's<00:06:44.340> not<00:06:44.430> really<00:06:44.490> useful<00:06:45.030> or<00:06:45.150> anything

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
so it's not really useful or anything

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.900 
so it's not really useful or anything
but<00:06:45.750> it's<00:06:45.900> kind<00:06:46.050> of<00:06:46.110> cool<00:06:46.320> to<00:06:46.350> see<00:06:47.190> what<00:06:47.940> is

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
but it's kind of cool to see what is

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.070 
but it's kind of cool to see what is
