annoyed me because I was like they're
not

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
blue the red she never uses any ability

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.670 
blue the red she never uses any ability
that's<00:02:16.790> highlighted<00:02:17.120> blue<00:02:17.569> in<00:02:17.780> any<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
that's highlighted blue in any of the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.350 
that's highlighted blue in any of the
vengers<00:02:19.010> age<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.310> Ultron<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.819> it's<00:02:19.940> nice<00:02:20.120> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
vengers age of Ultron so it's nice to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.699 
vengers age of Ultron so it's nice to
see<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.600> they've<00:02:20.930> fixed<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.620> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
see that they've fixed that in the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.949 
see that they've fixed that in the
actual<00:02:21.980> game<00:02:22.090> artwork<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.300> I'm<00:02:23.420> all<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.870> know

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
actual game artwork and I'm all you know

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.420 
actual game artwork and I'm all you know
it's<00:02:24.290> obvious<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.740> it's<00:02:24.980> going<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.190> be<00:02:25.310> like

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
it's obvious that it's going to be like

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.309 
it's obvious that it's going to be like
that<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.420> main<00:02:26.600> game<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.870> mean<00:02:27.050> it'd<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
that in the main game I mean it'd be a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.960 
that in the main game I mean it'd be a
bit<00:02:27.530> odd<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.709> choose<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.459> artwork<00:02:28.790> and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
bit odd to choose it in the artwork and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.120 
bit odd to choose it in the artwork and
then<00:02:29.090> not<00:02:29.390> put<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> game<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.320> red

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
then not put it in the game so red

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.100 
then not put it in the game so red
effects<00:02:31.580> hopefully<00:02:32.510> will<00:02:32.660> be<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.930> game

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
effects hopefully will be in the game

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.960 
effects hopefully will be in the game
but<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.709> know<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.160> kind<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.459> obvious<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
but you know it's kind of obvious and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.030 
but you know it's kind of obvious and
yes<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.810> said<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.530> Iron<00:02:36.890> Man
