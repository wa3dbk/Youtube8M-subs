00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840 

in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.900> video<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.290> want<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> go<00:00:01.770> over<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.460> DNA

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
in this video I want to go over the DNA

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.490 
in this video I want to go over the DNA
double<00:00:03.179> helix<00:00:03.210> so<00:00:03.689> just<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> little<00:00:04.110> bit<00:00:04.290> about

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
double helix so just a little bit about

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.610 
double helix so just a little bit about
its<00:00:04.650> structure<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.250> what<00:00:05.790> holds<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.150> together

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
its structure and what holds it together

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620 
its structure and what holds it together
so<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> DNA<00:00:08.010> double<00:00:08.340> helix<00:00:08.370> well<00:00:09.179> double

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
so the DNA double helix well double

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.970 
so the DNA double helix well double
comes<00:00:09.870> from<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> idea<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.469> there<00:00:10.620> are<00:00:10.710> two

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
comes from the idea that there are two

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.209 
comes from the idea that there are two
single-stranded<00:00:11.759> DNA<00:00:11.820> molecules<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.620> come

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
single-stranded DNA molecules that come

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.129 
single-stranded DNA molecules that come
together<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:14.969> held<00:00:15.179> together<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.719> one

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
together and are held together in one

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.170 
together and are held together in one
double<00:00:16.590> strata<00:00:16.830> DNA<00:00:17.250> molecule<00:00:17.699> that's<00:00:17.910> called

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
double strata DNA molecule that's called

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.120 
double strata DNA molecule that's called
the<00:00:18.270> double<00:00:18.570> helix<00:00:18.960> specifically<00:00:19.770> because

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the double helix specifically because

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.390 
the double helix specifically because
those<00:00:20.460> two<00:00:20.730> strands<00:00:21.449> don't<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.369> line<00:00:23.369> up

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
those two strands don't just line up

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.070 
those two strands don't just line up
together<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.240> twist<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.810> each

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
together they actually twist about each

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.450 
together they actually twist about each
other<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> they<00:00:27.119> arrange<00:00:27.840> themselves<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.800> an

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
other so they arrange themselves in an

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.240 
other so they arrange themselves in an
anti<00:00:30.090> parallel<00:00:30.359> fashion<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.859> reason<00:00:32.130> why

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
anti parallel fashion and the reason why

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.870 
anti parallel fashion and the reason why
this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> possible<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> strands

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
this is possible is because the strands

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.540 
this is possible is because the strands
themselves<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.320> directionality<00:00:38.040> they

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
themselves have a directionality they

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.950 
themselves have a directionality they
have<00:00:38.760> directionality<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.910> pull<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.120> polarity

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have directionality and pull or polarity

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.979 
have directionality and pull or polarity
so<00:00:43.890> directionality<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:46.160> polarity<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so directionality or polarity and so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.660 
so directionality or polarity and so
idea<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> five<00:00:49.980> prime<00:00:50.250> end

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
idea that they have a five prime end

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.060 
idea that they have a five prime end
and<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.969> three<00:00:51.210> prime<00:00:51.449> end<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> two<00:00:52.800> strands

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and a three prime end so the two strands

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.220 
and a three prime end so the two strands
that<00:00:53.250> line<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.579> against<00:00:53.820> each<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:55.079> will

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that line up against each other one will

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
that line up against each other one will
line<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.410> 503<00:00:56.219> prime<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.149> will

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
line up 503 prime and the other one will

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
line up 503 prime and the other one will
line<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.199> basis<00:00:58.500> complementary<00:00:59.160> in

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
line up with the basis complementary in

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.599 
line up with the basis complementary in
the<00:01:00.510> opposite<00:01:01.289> direction<00:01:01.440> it'll<00:01:01.980> run<00:01:02.129> 5<00:01:02.340> prime

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the opposite direction it'll run 5 prime

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.910 
the opposite direction it'll run 5 prime
to<00:01:02.640> 3<00:01:02.940> prime<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.539> other<00:01:03.719> way<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to 3 prime the other way so the way that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.390 
to 3 prime the other way so the way that
would<00:01:05.040> look<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.880> had<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:07.400> strand

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
would look is that if we had one strand

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.399 
would look is that if we had one strand
here<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> red<00:01:09.060> strand<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.780> five<00:01:10.140> prime<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
here this red strand going five prime to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.190 
here this red strand going five prime to
three<00:01:10.530> prime<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.990> blue

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
three prime down this way then the blue

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
three prime down this way then the blue
strand<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.830> 5<00:01:14.130> prime<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.760> 3<00:01:15.030> prime

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
strand would be going 5 prime to 3 prime

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
strand would be going 5 prime to 3 prime
up<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> idea

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
up the other way so that's the idea

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.469 
up the other way so that's the idea
behind<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.020> being<00:01:19.380> anti<00:01:19.830> parallel<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
behind it being anti parallel now the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.520 
behind it being anti parallel now the
backbone<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.920> backbone<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.580> specifically<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
backbone the backbone is specifically a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.940 
backbone the backbone is specifically a
sugar<00:01:25.820> oops

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
sugar oops

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.270 
sugar oops
put<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:30.350> sugar<00:01:31.350> phosphate<00:01:34.939> backbone<00:01:36.259> now

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
put a why a sugar phosphate backbone now

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
put a why a sugar phosphate backbone now
that<00:01:38.280> backbone<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> course<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.509> thick

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that backbone is of course these thick

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.960 
that backbone is of course these thick
lines<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.829> thick<00:01:41.100> red<00:01:41.340> line<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.759> this

thick blue line I wrote here I asked is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.510 
thick blue line I wrote here I asked is
the<00:01:44.939> backbone<00:01:45.149> charged<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:47.100> answer<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> that

the backbone charged the answer to that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.270 
the backbone charged the answer to that
question<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.030> yes<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.439> charged<00:01:49.860> well<00:01:50.009> what

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
question is yes it is charged well what

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330 
question is yes it is charged well what
is<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.990> gives<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.619> backbone<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.979> charge

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is it that gives the backbone the charge

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
is it that gives the backbone the charge
first<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> negatively<00:01:55.079> charged

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
first of all it's negatively charged

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.179 
first of all it's negatively charged
okay<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.869> negative<00:01:58.079> charge<00:01:58.290> comes<00:01:59.009> from

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
okay and that negative charge comes from

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
okay and that negative charge comes from
the<00:01:59.280> phosphate<00:01:59.759> groups<00:02:00.229> right<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> phosphate

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the phosphate groups right the phosphate

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.039 
the phosphate groups right the phosphate
groups<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.219> negative<00:02:02.579> charges<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.049> along

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
groups have negative charges so along

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.260 
groups have negative charges so along
this<00:02:04.259> backbone<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> bunch<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this backbone we have a bunch of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.600 
this backbone we have a bunch of
negative<00:02:06.659> charges<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.489> go

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
negative charges here and I can go

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.690 
negative charges here and I can go
through<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
through and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.919 
through and
and<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.910> know<00:02:10.030> write<00:02:10.270> them<00:02:10.450> all<00:02:10.599> out<00:02:10.629> these

phosphate groups have negative charges
on<00:02:26.230> them<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.560> DNA<00:02:27.040> overall<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.000> charged

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.000 
followed one strand that strand would
move<00:03:12.250> clockwise<00:03:13.239> okay<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:17.010> understanding

move clockwise okay so understanding

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
okay so these H bonds between the base

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.920 
okay so these H bonds between the base
pairs<00:04:31.949> hold<00:04:32.949> are<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.490> primary<00:04:34.030> sort<00:04:34.569> of<00:04:34.660> force

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
pairs hold are the primary sort of force

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.710 
pairs hold are the primary sort of force
that<00:04:35.080> hold<00:04:35.380> these<00:04:35.669> these<00:04:36.669> individual<00:04:37.509> single

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
that hold these these individual single

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.240 
that hold these these individual single
strands<00:04:37.990> together<00:04:38.319> in<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.680> double-stranded

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
strands together in this double-stranded

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.570 
strands together in this double-stranded
DNA<00:04:39.479> now<00:04:40.479> between<00:04:40.960> each<00:04:41.229> a<00:04:41.440> T<00:04:41.530> pair<00:04:42.130> there<00:04:42.430> are

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
DNA now between each a T pair there are

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.990 
DNA now between each a T pair there are
two<00:04:43.090> hydrogen<00:04:43.690> bonds<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.380> between<00:04:45.069> the<00:04:45.340> CG

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
two hydrogen bonds and between the CG

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.089 
two hydrogen bonds and between the CG
pairs<00:04:46.330> there<00:04:46.810> are<00:04:46.840> three<00:04:47.319> hydrogen<00:04:47.740> bonds<00:04:48.039> so

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
pairs there are three hydrogen bonds so

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.770 
pairs there are three hydrogen bonds so
I've<00:04:48.190> ever<00:04:48.340> presented<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.789> here<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.330> didn't

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
I've ever presented that here I didn't

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.120 
I've ever presented that here I didn't
actually<00:04:49.870> write<00:04:50.289> out<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.560> letters<00:04:50.860> but<00:04:51.099> I

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
actually write out the letters but I

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.559 
actually write out the letters but I
wrote<00:04:51.280> here<00:04:51.430> that<00:04:51.580> some<00:04:51.819> of<00:04:51.849> these<00:04:52.060> each<00:04:52.509> of

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
wrote here that some of these each of

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.300 
wrote here that some of these each of
these<00:04:52.750> dots<00:04:53.050> represents<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.740> hydrogen<00:04:54.099> bonds

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
these dots represents the hydrogen bonds

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.310 
these dots represents the hydrogen bonds
so<00:04:54.520> two<00:04:54.610> dots<00:04:55.000> means<00:04:55.300> two<00:04:55.660> hydrogen<00:04:55.990> bonds

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
so two dots means two hydrogen bonds

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.740 
so two dots means two hydrogen bonds
three<00:04:57.039> dots<00:04:57.220> means<00:04:57.550> three<00:04:57.849> hydrogen<00:04:58.270> bonds<00:04:58.449> so

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
three dots means three hydrogen bonds so

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.290 
three dots means three hydrogen bonds so
this<00:04:59.380> would<00:04:59.560> be<00:04:59.680> an<00:04:59.770> 80<00:04:59.979> pair<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.820> this<00:05:01.000> here

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
this would be an 80 pair and this here

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.110 
this would be an 80 pair and this here
would<00:05:01.419> be<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.599> CG<00:05:02.440> pair<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:03.580> way<00:05:03.699> I<00:05:03.729> remember

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
would be a CG pair the way I remember

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.140 
would be a CG pair the way I remember
that<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.599> this<00:05:04.810> sort<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.139> silly<00:05:05.349> way<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.590> think

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
that is this sort of silly way I think

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.860 
that is this sort of silly way I think

I'm<00:05:19.479> afraid<00:05:19.690> guy<00:05:19.990> anyway<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.949> point<00:05:21.099> is<00:05:21.250> that

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
I'm afraid guy anyway the point is that

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.450 
I'm afraid guy anyway the point is that
the<00:05:22.509> 80<00:05:22.750> pairs<00:05:23.259> have<00:05:23.590> two<00:05:23.830> H<00:05:23.979> bonds<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.340> hold

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
the 80 pairs have two H bonds that hold

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.189 
the 80 pairs have two H bonds that hold
them<00:05:24.610> together<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:25.090> CG<00:05:25.389> pairs<00:05:25.599> have<00:05:25.780> three<00:05:26.080> h

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
them together the CG pairs have three h

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.290 
them together the CG pairs have three h
bonds<00:05:26.500> that<00:05:26.590> hold<00:05:26.710> them<00:05:26.860> together<00:05:27.300> however

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
bonds that hold them together however

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.999 
bonds that hold them together however
you<00:05:28.599> remember<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.080> it's<00:05:29.259> up<00:05:29.409> to<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.680> but

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
you remember that it's up to you but

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.110 
you remember that it's up to you but
this<00:05:30.130> is<00:05:30.190> how<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.370> remember<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.909> you<00:05:30.970> probably

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
this is how I remember and you probably

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.010 
this is how I remember and you probably
won't<00:05:31.330> forget<00:05:31.630> how<00:05:31.990> silly<00:05:32.320> that<00:05:32.470> was<00:05:32.650> okay

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
won't forget how silly that was okay

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.180 
won't forget how silly that was okay
there<00:05:35.020> are<00:05:35.050> some<00:05:35.590> other<00:05:35.740> things<00:05:36.009> though<00:05:36.159> that

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
there are some other things though that

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.360 
there are some other things though that
hold<00:05:36.580> these<00:05:36.729> two<00:05:36.970> strands<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.870> DNA<00:05:38.139> together

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
hold these two strands of DNA together

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.140 
hold these two strands of DNA together
the<00:05:39.370> one<00:05:40.120> key<00:05:40.479> idea<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:41.080> this<00:05:41.289> idea<00:05:41.620> of

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
the one key idea is this idea of

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.620 
the one key idea is this idea of
separation<00:05:43.150> of<00:05:43.419> hydro<00:05:44.820> philic<00:05:46.139> regions<00:05:47.139> and

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
separation of hydro philic regions and

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:58.050 
separation of hydro philic regions and
anhydrous<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:50.349> hydrophobic<00:05:50.979> regions<00:05:56.400> so

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
anhydrous and hydrophobic regions so

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.270 
anhydrous and hydrophobic regions so
philic<00:05:58.300> regions<00:05:58.630> include<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.230> backbone<00:05:59.650> the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
philic regions include the backbone the

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.190 
philic regions include the backbone the
backbone<00:06:00.700> is<00:06:00.910> is<00:06:01.240> you<00:06:01.810> know<00:06:01.840> has<00:06:02.080> these

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
backbone is is you know has these

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.110 
backbone is is you know has these
negative<00:06:02.590> charges<00:06:02.889> sugar<00:06:03.880> phosphate

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
negative charges sugar phosphate

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.409 
negative charges sugar phosphate
backbone<00:06:04.389> it<00:06:05.169> is<00:06:05.770> hydrophilic<00:06:06.240> whereas<00:06:07.240> the

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
backbone it is hydrophilic whereas the

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.180 
backbone it is hydrophilic whereas the
interior<00:06:07.870> these<00:06:08.080> nitrogenous<00:06:08.650> bases<00:06:08.889> are<00:06:09.130> not

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
interior these nitrogenous bases are not

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.100 
interior these nitrogenous bases are not
so<00:06:09.520> hydrophilic<00:06:10.150> they're<00:06:10.330> more<00:06:10.540> hydrophobic

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
so hydrophilic they're more hydrophobic

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.990 
so hydrophilic they're more hydrophobic
and<00:06:11.530> this<00:06:11.980> is<00:06:12.070> of<00:06:12.130> course<00:06:12.280> all<00:06:12.580> relatively

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
and this is of course all relatively

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.650 
and this is of course all relatively
speaking<00:06:13.419> right<00:06:14.820> how'd<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:15.970> like<00:06:16.300> dissolves

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
speaking right how'd you like dissolves

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.120 
speaking right how'd you like dissolves
like<00:06:16.840> so<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.230> hydrophilic<00:06:17.710> portions<00:06:18.010> will

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
like so the hydrophilic portions will

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.830 
like so the hydrophilic portions will
want<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.370> stay<00:06:18.550> together<00:06:19.000> in<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.330> hydrophobic

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
want to stay together in the hydrophobic

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.510 
want to stay together in the hydrophobic
portions<00:06:20.169> will<00:06:20.320> want<00:06:20.500> to<00:06:20.560> stay<00:06:20.710> together<00:06:20.860> so

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
portions will want to stay together so

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.580 
portions will want to stay together so
the<00:06:21.610> separation<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.930> fact<00:06:23.139> that<00:06:23.230> they're

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
the separation the fact that they're

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.800 
the separation the fact that they're
separated<00:06:24.250> in<00:06:24.340> this<00:06:24.520> way<00:06:24.760> that<00:06:25.360> the<00:06:25.540> backbone

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
separated in this way that the backbone

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.960 
separated in this way that the backbone
consists<00:06:26.800> of<00:06:26.889> the<00:06:27.070> hydrophilic<00:06:27.550> portion<00:06:27.700> and

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
consists of the hydrophilic portion and

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.020 
consists of the hydrophilic portion and
the<00:06:28.030> interior<00:06:28.510> is<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.660> hydrophobic<00:06:29.200> portion

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
the interior is the hydrophobic portion

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.629 
the interior is the hydrophobic portion
that<00:06:31.030> helps<00:06:31.270> stabilize<00:06:31.419> the<00:06:31.840> helix<00:06:32.139> in

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
that helps stabilize the helix in

if<00:07:13.720> you<00:07:13.780> think<00:07:13.990> about<00:07:14.110> a<00:07:14.470> really<00:07:15.130> really<00:07:15.310> long

if you think about a really really long
strand<00:07:16.000> really<00:07:16.450> a<00:07:16.510> bunch<00:07:16.780> of<00:07:16.900> base<00:07:17.050> pairs<00:07:17.350> all

these<00:07:17.860> different<00:07:18.280> interactions<00:07:18.880> here

these different interactions here
holding<00:07:19.479> this<00:07:19.570> together<00:07:19.750> you<00:07:20.410> can<00:07:20.500> imagine

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
holding this together you can imagine

holding this together you can imagine
that<00:07:20.890> this<00:07:21.039> is<00:07:21.100> overall<00:07:21.820> pretty<00:07:22.180> stable<00:07:23.640> so<00:07:24.640> I

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
that this is overall pretty stable so I

that this is overall pretty stable so I
