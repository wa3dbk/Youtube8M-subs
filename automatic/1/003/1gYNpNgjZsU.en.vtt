form are just the whole seed and that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
form are just the whole seed and that
you<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.410> scoop<00:00:55.710> put<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.430> water

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
bottle and shake it up now the chia

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.119 
bottle and shake it up now the chia
seeds<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.550> most<00:00:59.730> appealing

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
seeds are not the most appealing

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
seeds are not the most appealing
substance<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:03.120> keep<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.510> energy<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
course like there's energy bar is that a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
course like there's energy bar is that a
chocolate<00:01:06.570> Java<00:01:07.350> Crunch<00:01:07.860> deliciousness<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
chocolate Java Crunch deliciousness and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
chocolate Java Crunch deliciousness and
it's<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> anywhere<00:01:10.530> near<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it's not gonna be anywhere near that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.350 
it's not gonna be anywhere near that
tasty<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.240> thing<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.869> those<00:01:13.049> bars<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
tasty but the thing is with those bars I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.510 
tasty but the thing is with those bars I
find<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.200> high<00:01:16.500> sugar<00:01:16.560> rush

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
find that you get like a high sugar rush

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
find that you get like a high sugar rush
and<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:17.850> good<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and you're good but then you have like a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.010 
and you're good but then you have like a
crash<00:01:20.130> later

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
crash later

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.210 
crash later
so<00:01:22.020> chia<00:01:22.290> seeds<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.770> all-natural<00:01:23.780> long

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
so chia seeds are all-natural long

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.170 
so chia seeds are all-natural long
long-term<00:01:26.220> energy<00:01:27.119> sources<00:01:28.310> big<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
long-term energy sources big for

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
long-term energy sources big for
marathons<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.840> endurance<00:01:31.350> running<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:32.340> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
gonna run ten miles or more you should

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.190 
gonna run ten miles or more you should
really<00:01:35.340> give<00:01:35.549> cheese<00:01:35.759> chia<00:01:36.390> seeds<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> try<00:01:36.990> and
