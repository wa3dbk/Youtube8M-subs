00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
said I was I was building just with a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.790 
said I was I was building just with a
soft<00:02:14.970> player<00:02:15.210> out<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.510> time<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.020> he<00:02:16.560> sure<00:02:16.770> is

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
soft player out one time but he sure is

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440

I<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:43.830> work<00:02:44.100> ethic<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.910> few<00:02:45.180> years<00:02:45.390> I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
I know if my work ethic in a few years I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.860 
I know if my work ethic in a few years I
continued<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> develop<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.360> become<00:02:48.690> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
continued to develop and become a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.850 
continued to develop and become a
stronger<00:02:49.650> player<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.730> help<00:02:51.590> impact<00:02:52.590> player

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
stronger player can help impact player

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.940 
stronger player can help impact player
on<00:02:53.040> their<00:02:53.220> team<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:54.300> Chris<00:02:54.780> is

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
on their team I think Chris is

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.250 
on their team I think Chris is
interested<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:55.980> working<00:02:56.670> hard<00:02:57.209> well<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> lot<00:02:58.170> of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
interested in working hard well a lot of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.690 
interested in working hard well a lot of
Chris<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.590> play<00:02:58.770> out<00:02:58.920> whatever<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.489> know

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
Chris to play out whatever you know

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.630 
Chris to play out whatever you know
maybe<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.020> absolute<00:03:01.410> highest<00:03:01.920> level<00:03:02.459> but

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
maybe not the absolute highest level but

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.430 
maybe not the absolute highest level but
I<00:03:02.880> think<00:03:03.600> Chris<00:03:03.810> has<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:03.989> ability<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.470> play<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
I think Chris has the ability to play a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.900 
I think Chris has the ability to play a
fairly<00:03:07.440> high<00:03:07.560> level<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.980> hockey<00:03:08.190> n-c-double-a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
fairly high level of hockey n-c-double-a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.910 
fairly high level of hockey n-c-double-a
is<00:03:09.030> absolutely<00:03:09.510> there<00:03:09.660> from<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.680> is

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
is absolutely there from I think is

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.949 
is absolutely there from I think is
interest<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.610> work<00:03:11.790> hard<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.570> be<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> better

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
interest to work hard to be a better

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.780 
interest to work hard to be a better
player<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.680> would<00:03:13.799> be<00:03:13.860> stronger<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.610> and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
player it would be stronger and and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.420
