00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.119
 good percent we are have 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.459
 presenter 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.850
 are presenting for the two models next year percent and with 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.739
 It consists therefore of a restyling we have done to our model pillar the hour haas of 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.849
 wheels berlin 16 that besides ee 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.419
 also has developed by electronic ink injection to be able to meet 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.009
 Euro 3 regulations 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.310
 of missions for next year 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.180
 this will be given the rande sculptor then there will be a wheel scooter 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.150
 14 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.030
 the compact small sports car also with 125 water-cooled engine 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.930
 electronic injection these are going to be two star models we look for 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.280
 Next year, the market will now participate 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 well this closing was missing we started four years ago 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.520
 was missing by his megas cutter 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.220
 This segment is also a very popular segment and we are going to have 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.500
 from joined a vegas cutter 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.870
 of wheels of 15 tires of 15 with capable and helmets devices as they are explained 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.590
 by water with electronic injection 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.210
 that later will also be found in the 400 store 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 good with the bikes we had to live between two wheels and four 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 wheels for a hundred what are motorcycles dressed scooter are vehicles 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.220
 that we participate in him 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.380
 with our with a manufacturer 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.729
 with a Chinese manufacturer we are doing here developments in two 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.049
 dimensions and some vehicle in three dimensions as is the naked 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.260
 i percent the vehicle percent of two wheels this percent stock 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.420
 applied itself 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.100
 it is without a doubt 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.440
 to be able to compete in the market 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.820
 day by day 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.220
 not only motorcycles, most products are manufactured in countries 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.450
 Asians 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.770
 yes yes yes of course we have noticed then since the month of September 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.240
 there has even been a small recession the market 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.970
 he but logically it is because he was going up he had been three years 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.250
 going up a lot 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.630
 and it's normal too 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.869
 so if it's logical 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.159
 good for that reason I think it's positive that they are changes basically for the 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:14.929
 security 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.299
 he is hostage 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.879
 it really is not specialized in listening for 50 we have a single model 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.559
 after very normal benefits 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.299
 I think that for the moped sector it is good that there is already 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.149
 a few important restrictions but you have to think that they are very vehicles 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.149
 light ones that only have little braking and that therefore 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.359
 that therefore 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.249
 I think it's good that you increase the age and that it also decreases 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.429
 the passengers 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.969
 good to lezcar this vehicle that you see here we are 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.010
 percent is jumping here in Spain 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.390
 is a totally new vehicle is percent is a vehicle that was born from the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.949
 idea 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.109
 develop a quad 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.299
 with seat and steering wheel 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.789
 i see how is a 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.979
 it's a very very compact model 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.429
 It is a model post 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.829
 the one that has almost the dimensions of the unrwa atarfe two and a half meters 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.989
 iy in width of one meter 40 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.409
 from then on it is endowed with some technical characteristics about 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.109
 all of dynamics 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.719
 because they allow you to climb through the worst pockets of resistance 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:23.199
 then the German market that to influence by how to continue being so 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.829
 a little bit of the quad 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.810
 It's a little bit of the guy but in a slightly more versatile way no more 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.029
 comfortable to more 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.290
 or be much more peach
