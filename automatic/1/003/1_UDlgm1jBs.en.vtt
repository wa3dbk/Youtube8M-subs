00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.600 

so<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.560> pretty<00:00:43.710> obvious<00:00:44.130> because<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.460> have

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so it's pretty obvious because I have

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
so it's pretty obvious because I have
that<00:00:44.640> purple<00:00:45.180> square<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.650> reason<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that purple square and the reason that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.160 
that purple square and the reason that
happened<00:00:47.220> is<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.120> tried<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.810> put<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
happened is because I tried to put a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
happened is because I tried to put a
different<00:00:49.320> texture<00:00:49.710> pack<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
different texture pack and then I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.450 
different texture pack and then I
couldn't<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.180> back<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.540> had<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> UM<00:00:52.460> like
