00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.429

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.530
 find a small billion 10 5% 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.290
 chocolate chocolate chocolate comes less 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.809
 black or lose something it's nickel 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.859
 we're going there then but the flour 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.199
 and the butter in pieces is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.820
 better so flour butter 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 ok I have salt in the same one go salt 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 and yeast I imagine of course 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.230
 even well all 5 products with 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 cooper agree and sugar semolina tac it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.120
 go on and there you go all the products 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 bags of amiens visited diamonds 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 chocolate so we saw someone at 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.489
 bitter powders remember if one is ducasse 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.899
 sweet chocolate is not so good 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 it's less good we 'll get this more 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 sweet okay and we sand first 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.789
 speed of his quiet drummer 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430
 quiet 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.280
 okay 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.680
 and here it is simple and hyper sand is 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.030
 still very simple he took the yellow 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.840
 from egg hockey to and with that would make me ch 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 who communicates a common sweet dough 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.560
 a sand wu is stiff sanded ok ok 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.020
 and there you knead I imagine does not have too much 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.780
 down until the product is called 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.729
 galabert okay especially not try 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.350
 to have a very smooth product what we 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.210
 will work too much to learn to 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.050
 to develop the body and have something 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.670
 elastic 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.470
 it's called pushing the goal it's 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.860
 these are the proteins of the flour that are 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.950
 develops to have very very light duty 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.160
 really yet that it sticks to the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.140
 strain instead of modeling clay a 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.360
 little bit the character so there you see 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.530
 we will divide the mass in two we will 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.170
 start right now to do my 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.550
 happiness when you start here so you 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.950
 to do careful you see that 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.330
 you're not in the middle hunters 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.390
 it will make a hole in the middle of the sand tones 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.910
 and so these pages it so not too much of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.780
 flour it's just really not for that 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.130
 it sticks on a lot of work you see 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 thibaudat and we form his little pudding 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 so we can do it and its 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.450
 children it's the child it's frozen 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.430
 very well in addition I think yes that's it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.010
 really then 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.170
 so do not forget a questionnaire on a 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.330
 tray if we do not like fit and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.400
 crystal sugar with a small hitch to 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.989
 greasy and grocam ah ok 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.209
 and so here now we go where leaf you 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.340
