00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hello UTB marianna and today's 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:15.030
 video will be shot upon request for replacement 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.369
 Eyes have to train dolls as it is done on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.109
 take yorik, that is, the head of the doll 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.250
 it is not necessary to remove of course from the body but 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'll show you in pure Eureka 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.760
 top lid it on magnets 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:39.000
 done you see that there are eye sockets 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.149
 these eye sockets need to be filled with eyes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 what you need for this means 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.399
 eyes themselves and special velcro 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.289
 so is it sold specialized 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 the stores are in between 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.649
 plasticine chewing and chewing gum on the sect 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.799
 is such a mass stretching in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.350
 same time all the same no gum and 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 clay that leaves traces means 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.750
 she can in such plates as be and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:19.640
 maybe these are the same color 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 maybe different white yellow pink 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 green here's green for example next 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.659
 stage what eyes means eyes can be 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 different as the size of the color but also the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.729
 the main form here everything will depend on 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.250
 forms depending on the form 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:51.840
 way of sticking your eyes can be 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.360
 glass plastic so here i have 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 this yorica is deep enough 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.000
 eye sockets here they are caps 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.890
 so for this yorika were chosen 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.760
 such plastic eyes are enough 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.610
 deep 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.730
 sphere you see a deep sphere 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 enough that is the pupil itself 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.010
 deep enough and the eye itself 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.940
 enough too so elongated and with 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.350
 there are plastic legs too 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.330
 plastic eyes 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.280
 but they are such hemispheres 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.950
 they are usually for small orbits not 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:44.070
 so deep but nonetheless they too 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 relevant here they are so why are you too 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:52.230
 quite relevant and glass 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.090
 here they can also be like 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.740
 hemispheres this is not what they are called 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.950
 oval and back 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.730
 flat such they have enough because 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.000
 flat 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.750
 sphere here and here are such glass 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.440
 spheres full sphere 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 with a leg the leg is short 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.020
 then how do you do all this 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.880
 velcro eye dependence means from 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.590
 eye shape velcro pro on different 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:42.450
 stick on the eye of our take Velcro 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:49.569
 count we tidy up the fish and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:55.989
 stick on the back and flatten out 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:04:06.330
 limits eyes muzychka so now we put 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:11.769
 inside and glue mom also 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:17.280
 stick this food you need pervosti 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.280
 do not regret this consumable such material 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.970
 more eye sockets are enough here 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.090
 large so here is more difficult and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:40.030
 glue here and so it is like this 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:44.760
 to a fastener that's supposedly got here 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.760
 Yurik himself caught on the Terek itself 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.020
 glue 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:01.170
 need more 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:08.850
 principle did you understand yes here's an eye 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:11.670
 it sticks with the second 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.610
 With the eye the same thing to do if you have 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.860
 spherical eye with plastic 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.160
 stick the same hemispheres on all 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.340
 eye area and stick what to do 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.170
 now if you have an eye like this 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.770
 spherical is also here on top and not 0 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:35.370
 we take it so much the same 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:41.720
 Unit sought and cats and sausage and a 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:49.640
 sausage rolls down and stick around 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:53.000
 around here eyes like a hoop 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.000
 around the eye 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.280
 So 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.880
 and paste 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.729
 glue 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.480
 not this way 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.539
 farther legs that 's what 's comfortable with it 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:24.740
 when you can turn the eye to 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:29.080
 pupil right look here he is here he 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.449
 moves so that he look straight 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:37.969
 or sideways or up what expression to you 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:42.370
 you need to do this 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:47.030
 either glued flat or rim 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:49.849
 so nothing like that here 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.090
 difficult there is no main thing to have the right 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.490
 the material is such a special velcro 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.759
 It is sold in all God forbid stores 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:03.650
 cost a penny not worth using for 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:06.199
 this chewing gum and or are there some 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.789
 improvised materials in the same clay 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:13.819
 as they leave with dirty footprints you 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:18.289
 just spoil yorick with nothing then 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:20.810
 don't wash thats all thanks for all 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.580
 I hope viewing and I was not late with this 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.379
 video since sucked him in 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:33.699
 gave a long time and it will help someone 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:33.699
 thanks for watching will give and all bye
