 owl and you will discover all this 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.140
 in this third issue it's a series 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.209
 I believe in four parts or five 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.230

 it is cowpea remigio but here it is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.519
 graphically it's very very nice 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.840
 it's a series that is struggling to take off 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.169

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.079
 we will be forced to reduce 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.790
 quantities on them on the numbers that 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.040
