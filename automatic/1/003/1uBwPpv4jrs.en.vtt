this is not this isn't crisis but this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.280 
this is not this isn't crisis but this

is pretty taxing on your system what's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.609 
is pretty taxing on your system what's
going<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.630> mean<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.409> spent

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
going on here it's I mean it they spent

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.050 
going on here it's I mean it they spent
a<00:02:07.680> lot<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.860> time<00:02:07.979> improving<00:02:08.610> textures

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
a lot of time improving textures

improving shader quality they're using a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.220 
improving shader quality they're using a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
as well that uses a lot of GPU

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.190 
as well that uses a lot of GPU
horsepower<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.240> know<00:02:16.360> they<00:02:16.510> they<00:02:16.810> really

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
horsepower you know they they really

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.630

kind of set the bar very high for

themselves in terms of just and what the
quality<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> game<00:02:21.880> will<00:02:22.060> look<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.330> and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
quality of the game will look like and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.050 
quality of the game will look like and
you<00:02:22.750> notice<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> recommended<00:02:23.560> specs<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
if you look at all the different quality

if you look at all the different quality
settings<00:02:26.710> low<00:02:26.950> through<00:02:27.430> ultra<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.480> kind<00:02:28.750> of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
settings low through ultra they kind of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.260 
settings low through ultra they kind of
set<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.080> bar<00:02:29.350> pretty<00:02:29.380> high<00:02:29.830> saying<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:31.150> don't

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
set the bar pretty high saying we don't

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.850 
set the bar pretty high saying we don't
want<00:02:31.450> our<00:02:31.570> game<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.020> look<00:02:32.170> any<00:02:32.350> worse<00:02:32.590> than

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
want our game to look any worse than

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.500 
want our game to look any worse than
this<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.610> if<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.820> don't<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.270> type<00:02:34.480> of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
this and if you don't have that type of

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.940 
this and if you don't have that type of
hardware<00:02:34.780> then<00:02:35.170> you're<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.470> going<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.890> have

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
hardware then you're just going to have

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.670 
hardware then you're just going to have
to<00:02:36.070> deal<00:02:36.280> with<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.930> mean<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.650> would

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
to deal with it so I mean what would

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.860 
to deal with it so I mean what would
what<00:02:39.040> do<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.280> feel<00:02:39.520> at<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.790> point<00:02:39.880> if<00:02:40.270> you're

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
what do you feel at this point if you're

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.090 
what do you feel at this point if you're
going<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.050> buy<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> game<00:02:41.590> what<00:02:41.830> would<00:02:41.950> you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
going to buy the game what would you

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.900 
going to buy the game what would you
want<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.370> your<00:02:42.550> minimum<00:02:42.880> CPU<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.870> GPU<00:02:44.910> for

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
want for your minimum CPU and GPU for

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.550 
want for your minimum CPU and GPU for
your<00:02:46.000> processor<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.540> think<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:47.050> can<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.380> pretty

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
your processor I think we can be pretty

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.500 
your processor I think we can be pretty
flexible<00:02:47.800> hear<00:02:48.490> anything<00:02:49.030> that's<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.240> quad

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
flexible hear anything that's a quad

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.150 
flexible hear anything that's a quad
core<00:02:49.810> processor<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.830> be<00:02:50.920> able<00:02:51.070> to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
core processor is going to be able to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.220 
core processor is going to be able to
handle<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.570> they're<00:02:52.810> recommending

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
handle it you know they're recommending

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.840 
handle it you know they're recommending
a<00:02:53.440> quad<00:02:53.980> core<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:54.340> they<00:02:54.430> don't<00:02:54.580> specify

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
a quad core but they don't specify

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.880 
a quad core but they don't specify
anything<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.780> terms<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.110> frequency<00:02:56.260> other

anything in terms of frequency other
than<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.190> lets<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.970> game<00:02:58.090> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
than that lets you know that the game is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.780 
than that lets you know that the game is
multi-threaded<00:02:59.500> capable<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.670> our

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
really went above 40 frames or forty

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.740 
really went above 40 frames or forty
percent<00:03:15.100> cpu<00:03:15.520> utilization<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.630> was

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
percent cpu utilization and that was

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.240 
percent cpu utilization and that was
even<00:03:16.840> running<00:03:17.110> fraps<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.830> performance

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
testing and that kind of stuff so I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.210

think<00:03:19.360> if<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.750> any<00:03:19.900> kind<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.220> athlon

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
think if you have any kind of athlon

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.220

front<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.209> will<00:03:28.330> be<00:03:28.450> feeling<00:03:28.660> pain<00:03:29.020> if

you try to do it on a dual-core

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.930 
you try to do it on a dual-core
processor<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.800> would<00:03:32.800> say<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.520> could<00:03:33.670> probably

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.729

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
get away with it we've had a lot of

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.470 
get away with it we've had a lot of
commenters<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.459> inform<00:03:36.850> members<00:03:37.090> kind<00:03:37.420> of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
commenters and inform members kind of

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.090 
commenters and inform members kind of
talking<00:03:37.690> about<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.230> they<00:03:38.350> dual-core

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
talking about that they dual-core

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.729 
talking about that they dual-core
processors<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.000> does<00:03:40.150> work<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:41.260> can't<00:03:41.530> do

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
processors and it does work you can't do

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.290 
processors and it does work you can't do
it<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.340> think<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.670> might<00:03:42.820> be<00:03:42.850> bottlenecked

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
it and I think you might be bottlenecked

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.550 
it and I think you might be bottlenecked
a<00:03:43.510> little<00:03:43.720> bit<00:03:43.840> more<00:03:44.050> at<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.380> lower

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
a little bit more at the lower

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.020 
a little bit more at the lower
resolutions<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.580> would<00:03:45.730> be<00:03:45.850> at<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
resolutions and you would be at the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.490 
resolutions and you would be at the
higher<00:03:46.180> resolution<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:46.989> at<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.170> point<00:03:47.230> it

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
higher resolution so at that point it

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.110 
higher resolution so at that point it
all<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.709> kind<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:47.890> depends<00:03:48.160> on<00:03:48.250> what<00:03:48.430> image

started throwing you know trauma to your
GPU<00:05:16.250> just<00:05:16.550> because<00:05:16.820> they<00:05:16.970> could<00:05:17.680> no<00:05:18.680> III<00:05:19.070> think

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.339 
GPU just because they could no III think
I<00:05:19.759> think<00:05:20.210> they're<00:05:20.330> actually<00:05:20.449> we<00:05:20.780> actually

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
I think they're actually we actually

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.050 
I think they're actually we actually
were<00:05:21.440> able<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.740> play<00:05:21.949> it<00:05:22.130> on<00:05:22.280> local<00:05:22.729> quality

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
were able to play it on local quality

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.089 
were able to play it on local quality
settings<00:05:23.419> with<00:05:23.570> a<00:05:23.599> 9800<00:05:24.289> GT<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:24.949> could

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
settings with a 9800 GT and you could

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.710 
settings with a 9800 GT and you could
play<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.460> it<00:05:25.580> was<00:05:25.669> passable<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.270> had<00:05:26.419> decent

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
play it it was passable you had decent

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.230 
play it it was passable you had decent
frame<00:05:26.900> rates<00:05:27.139> so<00:05:28.009> if<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.759> don't<00:05:28.970> want<00:05:29.090> to

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
frame rates so if you don't want to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.060 
frame rates so if you don't want to
upgrade<00:05:29.419> you<00:05:29.870> might<00:05:30.500> still<00:05:30.710> be<00:05:30.800> able<00:05:30.889> to<00:05:30.979> get

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
upgrade you might still be able to get

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.469 
upgrade you might still be able to get
away<00:05:31.190> with<00:05:31.280> playing<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.669> game<00:05:31.880> it's<00:05:32.060> can<00:05:32.180> be<00:05:32.270> a

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
away with playing the game it's can be a

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.570
