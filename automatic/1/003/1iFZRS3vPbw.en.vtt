00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
on the bottom of the towel so that way

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.190 
on the bottom of the towel so that way
you<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> little<00:02:44.819> bit<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:45.000> column<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the next six to ten hours it's probably

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.770 
the next six to ten hours it's probably
just<00:02:53.100> best<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.519> leave<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.880> be<00:02:54.090> overnight<00:02:54.569> and
