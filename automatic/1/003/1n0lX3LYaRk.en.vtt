rewired to poke the boat operates on a
24<00:03:11.240> volt<00:03:11.270> system<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.900> lot<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.170> stuff<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:12.440> 12

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
24 volt system a lot of the stuff is 12

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.310 
24 volt system a lot of the stuff is 12
volts<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.390> thanks<00:03:14.390> Brian<00:03:14.690> he<00:03:14.870> went<00:03:15.050> back<00:03:15.170> and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
volts so thanks Brian he went back and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.020 
volts so thanks Brian he went back and
required<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.770> lot<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:15.950> stuff<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.850> was<00:03:16.970> a

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
required a lot of stuff and so it was a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.880 
required a lot of stuff and so it was a
lot<00:03:17.210> of<00:03:17.240> a<00:03:17.600> lot<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.110> people<00:03:18.470> who<00:03:18.530> came<00:03:18.740> together
