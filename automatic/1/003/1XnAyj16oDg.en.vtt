00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 which he treated them as I hope life 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.629
 that very well as you will know the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.059
 women in addition to beautiful we are a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.330
 little bit dramatic but a little bit 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.250
 so you can imagine the chaos that is going 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.350
 to arm if the day of our birthday 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.630
 you give us something that does not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
 like so neither very deep interest 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 for helping them choose the best gift 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 for his girlfriend has given me the task of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.090
 bring them some little tips that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 they could use the time to go to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.309
 buy that gift my advice is not 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 necessarily for birthdays too 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.090
 applies for Christmas to the day of love or 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.860
 any other date that we 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
 we invent as long as you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 give things away what they have to do is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.739
 make a list with all 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 possible gifts and then choose one or 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.700
 two of that list that fit your 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.770
 pocket or your time and now is when 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.260
 you say but how are we going to do it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.989
 and that's where I come to his rescue two 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 very important things do not pay attention to us 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 when we go out with the 9 love I do not 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 I want nothing like being with you is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 enough because it is not and so you do not 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.939
 they give us a gift we will get angry and go to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 be much worse so let's avoid that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.969
 world 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.250
 as we simply say this because 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.869
 we want to seem needy but for your 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 own environment is not a pretty gift 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 now if your girlfriend gives you the list 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 of the gifts that I want that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.810
 you would reconsider a little follow 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 with her and number 2 and his girlfriend worked 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.259
 study it's a very good idea to go to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.270
 bring it to the time of departure they receive it 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.310
 with a nice bouquet of flowers and then 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.079
 can go to eat somewhere special and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 when I say special not necessarily 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.819
 it has to be expensive you just have to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.350
 be different from where they commonly eat and 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.299
 where you know that she is going to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 feel at ease and a detail that would be 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.959
 very nice is that you have it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 prepared a cupcake because you already know 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.159
 what birthday 5 stelle is not birthday 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.140
 and remember that even if they take her to eat 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 that does not mean they will not give 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 gift and now to make your list of 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.659
 gift have to take into account several 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.520
 first houses are attention to small 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.319
 comments we make or what 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.939
 we say when we walk by the 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.610
 mall regularly when 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.229
 we see things that we like we do to them 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.700
 you the comment but it happens that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 you never realize because they are 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.060
 well clueless so try to put 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.099
 a little 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.260
 everything is his part so that then it 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.760
 It's easier for them to choose a gift they know 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.380
 that she will like second 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.510
 generally women we like the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.700
 bracelets the earrings and all this kind of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 things if they decide to buy some of this 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.690
 make sure it is packed in its color 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.790
 favorite because if you know what your 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.099
 favorite color true third do not we 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.370
 give away clothes remember how much we 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.170
 It costs us to decide on a blouse so 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 it is very likely that if you 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.610
 they give away clothes we do not like but as 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 we are so beautiful we will have to use it 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.269
 although we do not like it, they realize 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.730
 sacrifices we make for 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.709
 you fourth do not take us to any 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.720
 store and tell us to choose something and 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.640
 that is going to be our gift that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.920
 The only thing he wants to say is that you do not 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.440
 they had neither the desire nor the time to think about 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.480
 something special for us and fifth what 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 most important of all is that if 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.620
 we noticed the effort that you 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.480
 they put in this detail not really 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.489
 it matters a lot whatever it is we're going to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.349
 appreciate and we will feel that they should 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.970
 give them important unless clearly 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.709
 have decided to give us a little package 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.750
 of those three hooks that like that either 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.280
 exaggerate those are the only tips that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.910
 I have for you so I hope that 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.040
 serve them 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.630
 and comment that you have given him to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 your boyfriend or girlfriend and what was your reaction 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.410
 when I tell you if you liked the video 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.140
 Well, do not forget to give it in the like 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.850
 share in your social networks spend the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.710
 video is a boyfriend so maybe he takes 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.660
 Any idea to give them a nice gift 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.820
 on your next birthday subscribe in 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.770
 the little button that's down here is 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.750
 around here I do not know but the important thing is that 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.790
 subscribe and so they will know when 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.980
 upload a new video already know that also 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.800

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.960
 see them next Friday and leave your 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.450
 comments if you notice a change of 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.730
 I 'm not going to tell you what I did 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.340
 because it's supposed to be a bit 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.740
 obvious the matter unless there is 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 done wrong so see you next 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.080
 trip or the classic situation that 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.360
 our compas leave from trip of the 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.890
 house was left alone and then we 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.980
 we have the great idea of inviting 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.980
 our boyfriend or girlfriend to watch movies
