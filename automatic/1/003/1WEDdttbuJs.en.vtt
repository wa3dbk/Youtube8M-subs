 candy 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.300
 24 dollars 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:49.239
 this is what it does with a Dutchman for 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.780
 buy yourself this part of the planet that 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.650
 today we call branded and think that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.300
 he bought it from a group of natives 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.129
 Americans who didn't even live there with 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.900
 continuity that they were migrants 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.699
 first here for the Dutch is 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.470
 arrived some May from under the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.910
 name also that river you see here 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.970
 my right had the day before 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.880
 discovered that you highline don't know that 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.590
 compared to the current cone because in the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.940
 Dutch language means rabbit 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.940
 and he finds so much 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 but to put this city on the map 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 architectural 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 must wait until 1853 reversed 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.759
 how the years do not come by nature 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 first the english in london we have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 modified the beautiful crystal palace 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.259
 for their world exhibition not 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.179
 only 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.679
 same was presented a 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.369
 rather interesting invention of the 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.619
 mr otis the elevator the demonstration 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 more spectacular and together 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.610
 the assistant was given a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.490
 impressive knife detail the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.439
 Rope or fright instead he shows 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 eyes with hooks safety that 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.080
 would have worked 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.799
 was the checkered flag for one 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.439
 extraordinary adventure of 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.660
 urbanization because architects 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.030
 they went up to the tower they approached that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.420
 this was a substantially erodes 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.520
 guide and imagine 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.819
 an impressive vertical venice 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.770
 in fact present in 1909 they build 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.190
 the metropolitan tower that the replica 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.190
 exact of the bell tower of san marco sigle 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.970
 an architectural ecstasy that lasts 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.459
 one hundred and twenty years untidy at times 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.069
 irrational but always tremendously 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 exciting in the biggest experiment 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.760
 urban history has been passed 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.830
 from the non-building friar for the time 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.530
 probably the most beautiful in the world 6 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.450
 reviews 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.040
 movies and twin towers that you don't see 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.130
 in the background and need 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.220
 explain to you why and the twin towers there 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.390
 they bring two facts into the 70s 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.030
 bloody vulgar trivial but that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.130
 tremendously vibrant in sport for 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.870
 example i new york knickerbockers 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.580
 that is the team that takes the name 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.890
 from the pants to the zuava of the Dutch 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.840
 founders win his first two titles 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.840
 which, however, will also be the last 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.390
 it is fought instead of the century between john 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.260
 phranger is a man who used to do it 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.260
 call classes and schools 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.000
 but city must also fight against a 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.340
 tremendous black out is a ferocious serial 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.800
 killer in the so-called red room but 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.280
 responds with the typical vitality of 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.000
 this place with 212 music genres 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.330
 the disc and the hip hop confirming that not 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.310
 there is a place like new york for 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.620
 affect the tastes of the entire planet 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.150
 there is only one comparable exception 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.580
 mid- england England 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.709
 sixty but not by chance one of the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.680
 main representatives of that wave 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.210
 john lennon will come here to live in 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.520
 70s
