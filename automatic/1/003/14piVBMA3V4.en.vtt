00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
really easy to do you just twist it like

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.040 
really easy to do you just twist it like
that<00:00:14.719> see<00:00:15.719> how<00:00:15.839> easy<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.279> just

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
that see how easy it is and you just

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.560 
that see how easy it is and you just
twist<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.650> petals<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.820> push

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
twist all the petals and you can push

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.480 
twist all the petals and you can push
them<00:00:21.810> differently<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
them differently you can just use the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.580 
them differently you can just use the
tip<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.689> half<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.449> looks

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
tip for just half way so it all looks

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
tip for just half way so it all looks
different<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:30.679> you<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.830> repeat<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.669> like

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
different and you just repeat them like

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.530 
different and you just repeat them like
that<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> lot<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.730> these

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that I know I have a lot of these

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.650 
that I know I have a lot of these
flowers<00:00:37.170> lying<00:00:38.160> around<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.969> puts

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
flowers lying around and so this puts

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
flowers lying around and so this puts
like<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> new<00:00:43.530> dimension<00:00:43.860> whoops<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:46.430> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
like a new dimension whoops to them and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.619 
like a new dimension whoops to them and
you<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.760> talk<00:00:48.059> them<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you just talk them like that and then I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.439 
you just talk them like that and then I
use<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.199> small<00:00:55.850> prima<00:00:56.850> mini<00:00:57.600> rose<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.180> into

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
use a small prima mini rose to put into

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.049 
use a small prima mini rose to put into
the<00:01:00.570> center<00:01:01.280> that's<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the center that's like really the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.649 
the center that's like really the
easiest<00:01:03.210> way<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
easiest way to do it and you have to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
easiest way to do it and you have to
work<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.860> pedals<00:01:11.030> just<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.869> them

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
work the pedals just like you want them

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:25.240 
work the pedals just like you want them
to<00:01:13.229> look<00:01:15.020> like<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:17.900> not<00:01:18.900> quite

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.640 

that's<00:01:25.940> better<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.870> then<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.350> twist

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
that's better and then you just twist

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.990 
that's better and then you just twist
the<00:01:27.950> wire<00:01:28.250> on<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.940> back<00:01:30.550> so<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.850> holds

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
the wire on the back so that it holds

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.469 
the wire on the back so that it holds
better<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.890> then<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:33.920> use<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.190> glue<00:01:34.550> dot<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:35.270> glow

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
better and then I use a glue dot to glow

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.130 
better and then I use a glue dot to glow
it<00:01:35.600> down<00:01:35.810> when<00:01:36.380> i<00:01:36.410> use<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:38.600> it's<00:01:38.810> r<00:01:38.990> it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
it down when i use it but it's r it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:49.890 
it down when i use it but it's r it
really<00:01:39.620> is<00:01:40.280> enough<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.180> make<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:44.530> hold<00:01:47.920> so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
really is enough just to make it hold so

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.170 
really is enough just to make it hold so
voila<00:01:51.160> pretty<00:01:52.160> right

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.330 

and<00:01:58.750> then<00:01:58.900> that's<00:01:59.080> another<00:01:59.230> one<00:01:59.650> it's<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.100> pink

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and then that's another one it's a pink

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.960 
and then that's another one it's a pink
one<00:02:00.550> this<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.850> really<00:02:01.150> pretty<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:02.800> I<00:02:03.310> use<00:02:03.490> more

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
one this is really pretty and I use more

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.950 
one this is really pretty and I use more
layers<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.950> twist<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.310> pebbles<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:07.510> same

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
layers and I twist the pebbles just same

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:17.580 
layers and I twist the pebbles just same
I<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:10.060> repeat<00:02:10.660> all<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:12.540> flowers<00:02:16.470> put<00:02:17.470> the

big<00:02:17.800> ones<00:02:18.070> at<00:02:18.280> least<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:24.280> them<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.610> top<00:02:24.820> of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
big ones at least put them on top of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.410

first video ever and I also take this
little<00:02:48.580> one<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.980> twist<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.150> can<00:02:52.330> really

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
little one and twist it you can really
use<00:02:53.020> all<00:02:53.650> kinds<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.730> paper<00:02:55.600> flowers<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.320> these

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
use all kinds of paper flowers for these

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.510 
use all kinds of paper flowers for these
just<00:02:57.730> play<00:02:58.000> around<00:02:58.120> with<00:02:58.450> it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.860 

so<00:03:04.150> that's<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:05.610> tiny<00:03:06.610> tiny<00:03:08.100> Daisy<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.910> just

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
so that's the tiny tiny Daisy and I just

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.470 
so that's the tiny tiny Daisy and I just
rip<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.350> up<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.820> center<00:03:13.270> and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
rip it up like that to the center and

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.940 
rip it up like that to the center and
then<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.850> twist<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:17.310> little<00:03:18.310> bit<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:20.470> roll<00:03:20.800> it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
then I twist it a little bit is roll it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.620 
then I twist it a little bit is roll it
up<00:03:21.130> oops<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:23.020> really<00:03:23.410> tiny<00:03:23.740> and<00:03:25.800> then<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:27.630> is

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
up oops it's really tiny and then it is

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.670 
up oops it's really tiny and then it is
a<00:03:28.660> small<00:03:29.410> bride<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:34.350> put<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.440> through<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
a small bride and put it through the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.120 
a small bride and put it through the
center

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.890 

it's<00:03:41.700> really<00:03:42.240> small<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.900> it's<00:03:43.290> bit<00:03:43.800> difficult

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
it's really small so it's bit difficult

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.550 
it's really small so it's bit difficult
but<00:03:46.880> be<00:03:47.880> patient<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.570> under<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.990> next<00:03:49.320> one

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
but be patient and under the next one

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.850 
but be patient and under the next one
the<00:03:50.430> same<00:03:50.700> size<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.820> bend<00:03:54.330> it

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
the same size and I just bend it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.730 
the same size and I just bend it
outwards<00:03:55.860> like<00:03:57.440> that<00:04:00.050> it's<00:04:01.050> really<00:04:01.200> cute<00:04:01.500> just

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
outwards like that it's really cute just

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.320 
outwards like that it's really cute just
like<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.550> could<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:02.850> use<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.210> like

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
like that you could just use it like

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.490 
like that you could just use it like
that<00:04:03.570> really<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.770> can<00:04:04.920> add<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.340> many

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
that really and you can add as many

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.200 
that really and you can add as many
flowers<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.830> like<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.460> you<00:04:08.490> want<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.030> be

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
flowers as you like if you want it to be

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.820 
flowers as you like if you want it to be
small<00:04:09.600> or<00:04:09.660> big<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.740> brat<00:04:11.100> is<00:04:12.140> kind<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.350> short

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
small or big that brat is kind of short

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.420 
small or big that brat is kind of short
so<00:04:14.640> it's<00:04:14.820> difficult<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.840> put<00:04:16.250> them<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.400> on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
so it's difficult to put them all on

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.880 
so it's difficult to put them all on
there<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:22.049> depends<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.620> how<00:04:22.770> many<00:04:24.890> how

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
there so this depends on how many how

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.190 
there so this depends on how many how
big<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.310> flower<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.760> want<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.900> want<00:04:28.140> it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
big of a flower you want if you want it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.090 
big of a flower you want if you want it
to<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.350> bigger<00:04:28.800> than<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.370> just<00:04:29.580> add<00:04:29.760> more<00:04:31.100> or

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
to be bigger than you just add more or

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.900 
to be bigger than you just add more or
you<00:04:32.280> can<00:04:32.490> also<00:04:32.700> make<00:04:33.060> just<00:04:33.300> small<00:04:33.570> ones<00:04:34.910> this

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
you can also make just small ones this

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.600 
you can also make just small ones this
one<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.300> really<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:38.510> six<00:04:39.510> layers<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.200> think

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.939 

so<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.539> it's<00:04:45.080> open<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.650> Brad<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:47.650> hold<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.860> all

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
so and it's open the Brad to hold it all

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.820 
so and it's open the Brad to hold it all
together<00:04:49.159> and<00:04:50.590> just<00:04:53.409> squeeze<00:04:54.409> you<00:04:54.560> tightly

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
together and just squeeze you tightly

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.089 
together and just squeeze you tightly
and<00:04:55.159> then<00:04:55.340> just<00:04:55.750> arrange<00:04:56.750> all<00:04:57.379> the<00:04:57.650> paddles

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
and then just arrange all the paddles

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.619 
and then just arrange all the paddles
and<00:04:58.430> maybe<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.759> have<00:04:58.819> to<00:04:58.969> twist<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.449> few<00:04:59.689> again

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
and maybe you have to twist a few again

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.360 
and maybe you have to twist a few again
because<00:05:02.629> they<00:05:02.840> get<00:05:03.050> kind<00:05:03.710> of<00:05:03.770> messy<00:05:04.039> when

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
because they get kind of messy when

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.779 
because they get kind of messy when
you're<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.669> putting<00:05:05.090> all<00:05:05.509> on<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.990> Brad<00:05:06.789> just

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
you're just putting all on the Brad just

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.980 
you're just putting all on the Brad just
make<00:05:08.060> them<00:05:08.270> look<00:05:08.479> as<00:05:09.349> pretty<00:05:09.590> as<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.889> like

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
make them look as pretty as you like

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.969 
make them look as pretty as you like
pull<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.259> petals<00:05:12.590> up<00:05:13.479> look<00:05:14.680> really<00:05:15.680> pretty

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
pull the petals up look really pretty

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.240 
pull the petals up look really pretty
and<00:05:17.050> super<00:05:18.050> easy<00:05:18.729> thank<00:05:19.729> you<00:05:20.000> bye-bye
