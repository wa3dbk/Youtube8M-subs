vs<00:01:49.110> iphone<00:01:49.320> 5<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.100> dual<00:01:50.399> core<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
vs iphone 5 which is a dual core so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.420 
vs iphone 5 which is a dual core so
that's<00:01:51.030> why<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.210> more<00:01:51.509> powerful<00:01:52.049> than<00:01:52.890> the

that's why it's more powerful than the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.719 
that's why it's more powerful than the
iphone<00:01:54.149> 5s<00:01:54.770> next<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> 3dmark

reason<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.790> don't<00:02:29.850> know<00:02:30.030> why<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.780> are<00:02:30.900> the

reason I don't know why what are the

reasons those reasons are not known to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.710 
reasons those reasons are not known to
me<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.430> all<00:02:35.640> other<00:02:35.820> benchmarks<00:02:36.270> they

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
me because on all other benchmarks they

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.290 
me because on all other benchmarks they
are<00:02:36.900> very<00:02:37.200> similar<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.740> each<00:02:37.860> other

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
are very similar to each other

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.490 
are very similar to each other
considering<00:02:39.300> if<00:02:39.450> they<00:02:39.600> run<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.990> graphical

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
considering if they run the graphical

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.980 
considering if they run the graphical
graphics<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.430> off-screen<00:02:42.330> board<00:02:42.630> which<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
graphics in off-screen board which is a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.910

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
1080p if they run the graphics in 1080p

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.020 
1080p if they run the graphics in 1080p
mode<00:02:47.220> both<00:02:47.970> are<00:02:48.240> very<00:02:48.390> similar<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.350> each<00:02:49.560> other

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
mode both are very similar to each other

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.790 
mode both are very similar to each other
however<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> native<00:02:51.480> score<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.990> different

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
however the native score is different

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.940 
however the native score is different
because<00:02:52.950> iphone<00:02:53.790> 5s<00:02:54.180> has<00:02:54.450> less<00:02:55.140> resolution<00:02:55.530> as

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
because iphone 5s has less resolution as

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.390 
because iphone 5s has less resolution as
compared<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.460> note<00:02:57.270> 3<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.560> last<00:02:58.800> we<00:02:59.190> have

second<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:17.010> reason<00:03:17.370> why<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.670> iPhone<00:03:18.390> 5s<00:03:18.650> take

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
second the reason why the iPhone 5s take

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.530 
second the reason why the iPhone 5s take
a<00:03:19.680> lead<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.220> first<00:03:20.460> one<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.880> once<00:03:21.420> again

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
a lead on the first one is once again

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.570 
a lead on the first one is once again
because<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> resolution<00:03:22.680> because<00:03:23.100> it's

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
because of the resolution because it's

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.790 
because of the resolution because it's
