00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
add all the ingredients together in the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.190

vial or in the jar and let it sit on the
show<00:06:00.470> from<00:06:00.890> anywhere<00:06:01.490> from<00:06:01.790> one<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.540> four

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050

weeks undisturbed before you use it

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.470 
weeks undisturbed before you use it
so<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:07.010> vinegar<00:06:07.550> has<00:06:07.820> enough<00:06:08.210> time<00:06:08.419> to

so the vinegar has enough time to

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.020 
so the vinegar has enough time to
extract<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.470> properties<00:06:09.740> out<00:06:10.460> of<00:06:10.490> all<00:06:10.820> the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030
