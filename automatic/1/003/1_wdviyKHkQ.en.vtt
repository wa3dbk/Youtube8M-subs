and the fact that he he was just
genuinely<00:02:04.930> curious<00:02:05.230> to<00:02:05.800> know<00:02:05.950> what<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.250> was

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
genuinely curious to know what it was

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.070 
genuinely curious to know what it was
that<00:02:06.580> he'd<00:02:06.670> seen<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.150> have<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.510> first

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
that he'd seen here we have the first

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.130 
that he'd seen here we have the first
object<00:02:11.320> with<00:02:11.710> part<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.130> an<00:02:12.790> island<00:02:13.180> here<00:02:13.480> we

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
object with part of an island here we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.930 
object with part of an island here we
have<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> second<00:02:14.650> object<00:02:14.770> coming<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.760> can

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
have the second object coming in you can

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.120 
have the second object coming in you can
see<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.210> they<00:02:16.540> appear<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> be<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.590> far

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
see that they appear to be this is far

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.650 
see that they appear to be this is far
more<00:02:18.250> cylindrical<00:02:18.550> one<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> theories

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
more cylindrical one of the theories

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.740 
more cylindrical one of the theories
that<00:02:20.080> was<00:02:20.290> proposed<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.310> maybe<00:02:21.580> kite<00:02:22.210> surfers

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that was proposed is maybe kite surfers

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.200 
that was proposed is maybe kite surfers
what<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.140> say<00:02:23.380> about<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.070> well<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> think

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
what do you say about that well I think

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.620 
what do you say about that well I think
this<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:25.360> moving<00:02:25.630> far<00:02:26.020> too<00:02:26.050> fast<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:28.150> kite

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
this is moving far too fast to be a kite

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.750 
this is moving far too fast to be a kite
also<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.380> has<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:30.070> would<00:02:30.220> imagine<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.640> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
also it has one would imagine that a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.420 
also it has one would imagine that a
kite<00:02:31.030> would<00:02:31.270> have<00:02:31.620> more<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.710> an<00:02:32.800> opaque<00:02:33.190> nature

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
kite would have more of an opaque nature

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.810 
kite would have more of an opaque nature
to<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> actual<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> actual<00:02:35.890> shooting<00:02:36.250> it

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.300 
to the actual to the actual shooting it
really<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.690> darndest<00:02:38.170> thing<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.100> more

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
really is the darndest thing the more

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.190 
really is the darndest thing the more
you<00:02:39.460> see<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.670> roughly<00:02:40.150> 40<00:02:40.540> seconds<00:02:41.080> of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
you see the roughly 40 seconds of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.500 
you see the roughly 40 seconds of
footage<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:42.040> more<00:02:42.310> detail<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:42.910> pick<00:02:43.330> up

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
footage the more detail you pick up

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.930 
footage the more detail you pick up
there's<00:02:44.230> no<00:02:44.500> image<00:02:44.890> manipulation<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
there's no image manipulation and

there's no image manipulation and

definitely no easy explanation for these

whatever<00:02:50.590> they<00:02:50.770> are<00:02:50.800> we<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.030> accept<00:02:52.510> that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
whatever they are we have to accept that

people genuine credible people who are
not<00:02:55.840> stupid<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.650> not<00:02:56.680> making<00:02:56.980> things<00:02:57.310> up

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
not stupid for not making things up

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
they're seeing things that have no

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
genuine explanation where that point is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.920 
genuine explanation where that point is
over<00:03:02.080> there<00:03:02.700> I'd<00:03:03.700> say<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.000> was<00:03:04.120> at<00:03:04.270> least<00:03:04.600> that

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
over there I'd say it was at least that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.250 
over there I'd say it was at least that
so<00:03:05.860> I'm<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.660> pitching<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.780> figures<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.200> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
so I'm on pitching it figures but I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
so I'm on pitching it figures but I
think<00:03:08.500> at<00:03:08.590> least<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.980> kilometer<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.520> half<00:03:09.640> we

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
think at least a kilometer and a half we

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.910 
think at least a kilometer and a half we
live<00:03:10.330> in<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.510> time<00:03:10.540> where<00:03:10.810> cameras<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.770> video

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
live in a time where cameras and video

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
live in a time where cameras and video
cameras<00:03:12.580> are<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.970> phones<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.750> everywhere

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
cameras are in phones and everywhere

cameras are in phones and everywhere
Nick's<00:03:15.220> footage<00:03:15.610> will<00:03:15.790> join<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.239> growing

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
Nick's footage will join a growing

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
just see what happens it's fascinating

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.729 
just see what happens it's fascinating
to<00:03:42.970> contemplate<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> prospect<00:03:43.989> of<00:03:44.470> other

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
during then when they started to move

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
during then when they started to move
the<00:03:52.950> speed<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.430> they<00:03:53.579> moved<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.969> past<00:03:54.269> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the speed that they moved up past the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
head-scratcher yeah we're not the only

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.550 
head-scratcher yeah we're not the only
grain<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.180> sand<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.599> beach<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.260> look<00:04:01.439> at

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
grain of sand on the beach and I look at

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.599 
grain of sand on the beach and I look at
it<00:04:01.650> from<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.829> point<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.249> view<00:04:04.099> these<00:04:05.099> battery

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
it from that point of view these battery

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.699 
it from that point of view these battery
ran<00:04:05.790> out<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:06.150> sort<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:06.930> halfway<00:04:07.170> through<00:04:07.680> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
ran out a sort of halfway through that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.220 
ran out a sort of halfway through that
so<00:04:08.489> he<00:04:08.760> got<00:04:08.969> this<00:04:09.090> roughly<00:04:09.420> 40<00:04:09.780> seconds<00:04:10.139> of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
so he got this roughly 40 seconds of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.789 
so he got this roughly 40 seconds of
footage<00:04:11.090> kind<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.180> went<00:04:12.840> down<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.439> drinks

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
footage kind of went down to have drinks

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.559 
footage kind of went down to have drinks

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
i'm i'm a bit of a skeptic with some of

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.620 
i'm i'm a bit of a skeptic with some of
this<00:04:24.180> stuff<00:04:24.419> but<00:04:24.660> oh<00:04:25.039> why<00:04:26.039> i<00:04:26.400> am<00:04:26.880> damned<00:04:27.389> if<00:04:27.570> I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
know what so what those things we've

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.510 
know what so what those things we've
ruled<00:04:29.490> out<00:04:29.520> kitesurfing<00:04:30.419> Somali<00:04:30.900> pirates<00:04:31.520> yes

ruled out kitesurfing Somali pirates yes

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.909 
ruled out kitesurfing Somali pirates yes
and<00:04:33.210> they<00:04:33.509> do<00:04:33.570> move<00:04:33.960> very<00:04:34.199> quickly<00:04:34.500> as<00:04:34.770> you

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
and they do move very quickly as you

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.890 
and they do move very quickly as you
like<00:04:35.340> i<00:04:35.430> say<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.639> you<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.330> have<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.690> watch<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
like i say you you do have to watch that

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.260 
like i say you you do have to watch that
over<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.680> over<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.070> again<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.669> then<00:04:39.150> you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
over and over and again and then you

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.029 
over and over and again and then you
actually<00:04:39.449> see<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.259> strange<00:04:40.650> sort<00:04:41.009> of

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
actually see that the strange sort of

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.100 
actually see that the strange sort of
behavior<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.789> these<00:04:41.910> things<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.539> size<00:04:42.840> of

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
behavior of these things and the size of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.600 
behavior of these things and the size of
them<00:04:43.229> as<00:04:43.349> well<00:04:43.500> see<00:04:43.919> in<00:04:44.009> the<00:04:44.070> foreground<00:04:44.370> there

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
them as well see in the foreground there

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.409 
them as well see in the foreground there
you<00:04:44.729> see<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.030> scale<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.449> that<00:04:45.780> that's<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.229> barge

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
you see the scale of that that's a barge

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.610 
you see the scale of that that's a barge
so<00:04:48.419> it's<00:04:48.509> not<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> small<00:04:49.020> sailboat<00:04:49.590> or

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
so it's not like a small sailboat or

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.409 
so it's not like a small sailboat or
something<00:04:49.919> like<00:04:50.009> no<00:04:50.160> no<00:04:50.520> absolutely<00:04:50.759> moving

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
something like no no absolutely moving

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.540 
something like no no absolutely moving
far<00:04:51.660> too<00:04:51.690> fast<00:04:51.930> what<00:04:52.919> are<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.070> saying<00:04:53.370> then

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
far too fast what are you saying then

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.909 
far too fast what are you saying then
Simon<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.060> mean<00:04:54.240> essentially<00:04:54.750> plenty<00:04:55.530> cracking
