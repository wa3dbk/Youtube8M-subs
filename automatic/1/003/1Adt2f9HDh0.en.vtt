00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
want me to have are you I mean have what

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.630 
want me to have are you I mean have what
do<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> experts<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.609> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
do you think that the experts do that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.529 
do you think that the experts do that
the<00:00:23.820> good<00:00:24.630> foot<00:00:24.839> there<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.460> mean<00:00:27.240> obviously

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the good foot there but I mean obviously

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.040 
the good foot there but I mean obviously
every<00:00:27.749> player<00:00:27.960> moves<00:00:28.589> different<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:30.050> guess

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
every player moves different and I guess

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.800 
every player moves different and I guess
coordination<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.369> big<00:00:32.610> factor<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.090> how

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
coordination is a big factor in how

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.010 
coordination is a big factor in how
smooth<00:00:34.170> let's<00:00:34.560> say<00:00:34.740> you<00:00:34.800> move<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
smooth let's say you move you know and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.510 
smooth let's say you move you know and
anticipation<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.290> big<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:39.470> again<00:00:40.520> playing

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
anticipation is big but again playing

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.770 
anticipation is big but again playing
with<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.970> hand<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.360> may<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.510> always

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
with the one hand there may be always

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.280 
with the one hand there may be always
looks<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.910> nicer<00:00:44.910> smoother<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.510> thing

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
looks a bit nicer smoother than thing

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.720 
looks a bit nicer smoother than thing
was<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> double<00:00:46.770> hammer<00:00:46.920> even<00:00:47.190> though<00:00:47.280> today<00:00:47.580> of

was a double hammer even though today of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.960 
was a double hammer even though today of

us feel beautiful to enter back ends and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.310 
us feel beautiful to enter back ends and
credible<00:00:50.970> video<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:51.570> stands<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.170> can

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
credible video which stands how they can

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.980 
credible video which stands how they can
move<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> side<00:00:53.430> special

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
move out to the back and side special

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.420

when<00:00:54.990> you<00:00:55.020> guys<00:00:55.200> at<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.440> top<00:00:55.590> especially<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
when you guys at the top especially and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.730 
when you guys at the top especially and
I<00:00:56.490> think<00:00:56.760> movement<00:00:57.720> has<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.900> huge<00:00:58.230> impact<00:00:58.350> today

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
I think movement has a huge impact today

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.070 
I think movement has a huge impact today
and<00:00:59.130> it's<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.340> everything<00:00:59.610> but<00:00:59.810> it's<00:01:00.810> a<00:01:00.900> big

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
and it's not everything but it's a big

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.440 
and it's not everything but it's a big
