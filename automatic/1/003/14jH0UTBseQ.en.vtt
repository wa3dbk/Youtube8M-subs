00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.480
 and the challenge I am very happy with you 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.740
 find in a new video is 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.480
 today I showed you the tutorial 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.619
 in pretty summer art so this 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.029
 week I will show you how is this 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.260
 we make palm branches 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.640
 so we send a little bit everywhere 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.560
 this moment on instagram because that's 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.150
 the season and in fact I received this ad 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 from homes in the world with very 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.340
 pretty pamiers it made me want to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.869
 see on my nails 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.920
 so we played it with this little tutorial and 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 I hope you will enjoy it 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.210
 so hardware side I used a 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.640
 base a top coat a nail polish 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.649
 white three pastel polish neon lights 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.960
 black acrylic paint a sponge has 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.030
 degraded drot ingle a fine brush and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.079
 a pallet 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.489
 I start as usual by 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.170
 apply a base on the set of 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.170
 houses to protect them from the pigment of the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.129
 varnish allow a better grip 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.809
 I then apply a nail polish 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.460
 white therefore follows the first in 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.989
 very thin layers and the second more in 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.049
 thickness so that the varnish dries more 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.049
 quick 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.909
 as always I do not have the outline of 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.940
 my nails with a full bbc brush 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.780
 only 20 I leave then dried my 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.069
 Wehrling ten minutes we pass the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.539
 nail art and we will start with the 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.619
 color gradient and for that I'm going 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.090
 show you two techniques for 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.229
 protect your one you will know without 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.970
 doubt the first technique that is 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.619
 protected around the nail with 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.240
 masking tape so I go in cuts 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.920
 and two strips of a long and one more 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.539
 small and I'm going to place the first 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.390
 around the nail and the second in water 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.830
 nail on the cuticle I take 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.299
 then a degraded foam that I 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.350
 cut in half as usual I you 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.030
 will put all the references of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.500
 products in info bar and I apply 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.060
 two strips of varnish of color that I 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.519
 then go downgraded on a palette 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.140
 without waiting I'll come and pat the 

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.369
 foam on my nail in ad of course 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.539
 the sides 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.369
 I do not hesitate to repeat the operation 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.060
 will be able to lay a second layer and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.440
 get more opacity 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.879
 I just need to remove the two strips 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.259
 Masking tape and clean but 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.709
 contours with a brush full of 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.330
 vch 10 only we go to the second 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.289
 technical with drot ingham then 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.149
 what is it is a liquid 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.860
 blue that is used in painting and that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.239
 we will apply on a surface that will 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.830
 become a little bit plastic in 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.450
 drying it is used in allard for 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.890
 to protect the perimeter of long for 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.239
 techniques a little messy like 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.860
 the water marc beuls or the and 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.480
 graded as here it must be left 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.640
 dry a few minutes until 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.200
 it becomes transparent do not forget to 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.849
 clean your brush with 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 soapy water right after that otherwise 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.400
 risk of damaging it 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.030
 and I will then degrade it 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.030
 as earlier 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.590
 once it's done just 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.180
 scratch the droid guillaume with a spike 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.680
 in wood for example and you will see 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.720
 that everything will be gone as well the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:49.340
 droid gun that the color after 5 to 10 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.140
 drying minutes I can go to 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.640
 palm branches for that I used 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.069
 black acrylic paint 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.840
 black polish will be just as good I 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.310
 start by making the central groove 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.840
 of the branch so for that I'm fine 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.400
 use the tip of my brush and 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 you can leave either from the bottom of the ngo 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.980
 either duo delon you'll see that I 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.480
 varies a little bit depending on 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.160
 the nail I'm going to make the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.440
 leaves so for that I'm leaving really 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.790
 from the center groove and I'm going overboard 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.090
 the brush then is refined for them 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.319
 to make almond shaped leaves have 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.670
 for some angles like here I 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.410
 do not hesitate to start the leaves 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.180
 directly on the corner of the nail for 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.530
 add a little bit to the pattern and then I 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.560
 will add my branch well in the middle 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.090
 nail for leaf shape 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.620
 do not hesitate to see a small photo of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.970
 palm branches next to you for 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.720
 really give you an idea of ​​the angle 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.800
 what do the leaves take 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.239
 personally I had the little 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.340
 advertisement that I showed you at the beginning 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.930
 from homes around the world to give me a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.360
 little bit of an idea of ​​the form that it 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.070
 had once it's done do not hesitate 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 not to come and flesh out a little bit 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.420
 leaves to have more opacity 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.890
 personally I prefer to study the 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.239
 painting on credit rather than varnish 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.799
 because it really works 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.549
 easily and it dry quickly 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.110
 on the pallet 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.820
 after if a year that varnish you 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.200
 can very well reproduce the pattern 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.430
 now if you have paint 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.269
 acrylic you can find in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.709
 breads from leisure stores 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.000
 creative I think it's more 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.290
 nice because in addition this is not 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.940
 you if you ever missed you can 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.230
 to pass a small cotton soaked with water and 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.959
 everything goes out without you having to 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.190
 redo all the base and poultry do not me 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.600
 remains more than to apply a good 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.769
 layer of top coat to keep my 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.950
 elhardt longer and do it 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.950
 shine 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.600
 and here is this tutorial is now over 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.800
 I hope you'll have more than that 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.150
 will have brought you some small 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.740
 additional tips for doing 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.180
 nail art and as always do not hesitate 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.620
 to like the video if you liked it 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.000
 always makes me very happy I hope 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.470
 I'll see him again on your nails 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.700
 with the hashtag knows the art that makes me 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.720
 always very happy to go see your 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.830
 photos on instagram 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.450
 I give you an appointment Wednesday 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.590
 next for a new you stood there 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.210
 so will launch more really in a 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.440
 summer atmosphere but I hope it 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.730
 you will like me anyway on the subject 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.290
 which is particularly important to me 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.980
 by then take care of yourself and I will 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.980
 kiss very hard
