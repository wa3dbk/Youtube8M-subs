but I thought the children's garden

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.240

needed<00:00:35.629> more<00:00:35.930> things<00:00:36.260> for<00:00:36.649> children<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:37.100> do

something that they know what a teddy

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.219 
something that they know what a teddy
bear<00:02:07.670> looks<00:02:08.030> like<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> see<00:02:08.599> a<00:02:08.629> plant<00:02:08.989> look

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
bear looks like but to see a plant look

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.229 
bear looks like but to see a plant look
like<00:02:09.409> a<00:02:09.440> teddy<00:02:09.709> bear<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.159> it<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> great<00:02:11.000> kick

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
like a teddy bear is it is a great kick

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.000 
like a teddy bear is it is a great kick
for<00:02:11.420> them<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.050> just<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.409> more<00:02:12.590> addition

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
for them so it's just one more addition

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.800 
for them so it's just one more addition
and<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.670> know<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.150> more<00:02:14.360> plans<00:02:14.599> for

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and I know that you have more plans for

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.530 
and I know that you have more plans for
the<00:02:14.900> future<00:02:15.379> and<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.650> think<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.950> trains<00:02:16.879> in<00:02:17.450> a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
the future and I think that trains in a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.000 
the future and I think that trains in a
garden<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.140> think<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.500> great<00:02:18.680> idea

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
garden I think that's a great idea

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.370 
garden I think that's a great idea
absolutely<00:02:19.670> we've<00:02:20.120> got<00:02:20.330> we've<00:02:20.960> partnered

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
absolutely we've got we've partnered

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.210

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.100 
with a train Club and we're gonna be
building<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.640> train<00:02:23.940> garden<00:02:24.240> as<00:02:24.570> soon<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:24.990> we

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
building a train garden as soon as we

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.440 
building a train garden as soon as we
can<00:02:25.230> get<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.470> funding<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.970> that'll

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
trying to raise the dollars and we're I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.090 
trying to raise the dollars and we're I
think<00:02:49.260> we'll<00:02:49.350> probably<00:02:49.440> turn<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.890> into<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
think we'll probably turn it into a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.190 
think we'll probably turn it into a
senior<00:02:50.430> project<00:02:50.640> too<00:02:51.150> another<00:02:51.720> way<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.930> get

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
senior project too another way to get

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.590 
senior project too another way to get
kids<00:02:52.560> involved<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:54.120> them<00:02:54.330> actually

kids involved in it have them actually
build<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.830> fine<00:02:56.160> when<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:56.490> get<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> money

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
