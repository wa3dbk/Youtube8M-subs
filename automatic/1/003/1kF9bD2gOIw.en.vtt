all this I drill a hole through here
hopefully<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.130> screw<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
hopefully that screw that on and then to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
hopefully that screw that on and then to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.260 
cover up the screw I just put that on
top<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:51.290> yeah<00:01:52.290> once<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.650> figure<00:01:53.010> out<00:01:53.159> attach<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
top and yeah once I figure out attach it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
know it okay so I'll figure out how to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.410 
know it okay so I'll figure out how to
attach<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:03.530> that's<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.680> gonna<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
attach it that's you gonna use this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
attach it that's you gonna use this
rounded<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.689> stick<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.039> an<00:02:08.159> old

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
rounded little stick it was an old

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.369 
rounded little stick it was an old
lollipop<00:02:09.239> stick<00:02:11.750> I'm<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.959> gonna<00:02:13.109> go<00:02:13.349> through

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
lollipop stick I'm just gonna go through

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.490 
lollipop stick I'm just gonna go through
the<00:02:13.829> entire<00:02:14.099> thing<00:02:14.459> hold<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.419> there

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the entire thing hold it there

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.570 
the entire thing hold it there
so<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.460> goes<00:02:17.580> free<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.860> glued<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so it goes free like a and glued to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.990 
so it goes free like a and glued to
these<00:02:20.730> ends<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.960> leave<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.880> it

these ends and and and leave it so it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.980 
these ends and and and leave it so it
can<00:02:27.290> actually<00:02:28.290> work<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.980> move<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.540> yeah

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
can actually work and move so yeah

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.770 
can actually work and move so yeah
that's<00:02:31.380> how<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.650> gonna<00:02:31.800> touch<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.780> I'll

and<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.130> know<00:03:35.459> that'd<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.180> then<00:03:36.390> I'll

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
and you know that'd be it then I'll

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.640 
and you know that'd be it then I'll
