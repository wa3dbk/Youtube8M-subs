goes for I'm pretty sure about it's
around<00:00:56.460> 2.5<00:00:57.090> case<00:00:57.449> what's<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.780> hit<00:00:58.109> search

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
around 2.5 case what's gonna hit search

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
around 2.5 case what's gonna hit search
there<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.879> was<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
was actually a really good guess he goes

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.109 
was actually a really good guess he goes
for<00:01:02.579> 2.5<00:01:03.059> k<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we're<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.729> trying<00:01:06.000> to

for 2.5 k so we're gonna be trying to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.030 
for 2.5 k so we're gonna be trying to
make<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> nice<00:01:06.479> profit<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.049> him<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:07.950> I'm

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
make a nice profit of him so what I'm

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
gonna try and do is bid about 2k 2k e

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.590 
gonna try and do is bid about 2k 2k e
1.9<00:01:12.990> K<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.950> gives<00:01:14.189> us<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> 500<00:01:14.640> coin<00:01:15.150> profit
