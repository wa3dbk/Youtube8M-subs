00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 and hello to all dear friends with you as 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.000
 I always have it and today I would like 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.170
 tell you about your small 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 selections of bugs minecraft version 1 62 for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.670
 This version is absolutely new for me 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.580
 i'm not here shaders nothing like that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.710
 and most likely it won't even be a bagio 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
 some mini bugs and let's principle 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.689
 Already let's start so the first bug is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 the volume that I get on one frame 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.420
 immediately laid 2 carpets 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.880
 That seems to be so impossible but I 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.880
 it happened and I built the code here 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.370
 a small building it all came up as 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.920
 bull lever that is created is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.960
 feeling that using these marked 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 you can understand whether the lever is working 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 turned on it or not turned on actually it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.160
 just got a little confused 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 red top and green probably at the bottom 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 Well, let's probably tell you how 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.190
 build it 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.690
 so let's get down to start us 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 need the most ordinary 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.260
 wooden fence set my height 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.080
 two blocks 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.580
 we take our favorite frame tank here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.560
 is that the distance here 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 rather strange because it is not clear what 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.530
 holding our favorite frame well it's not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 the essence and let's continue so let's start taking 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.150
 lime carpet put it in our favorite 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.490
 frame and it seems like nothing can be 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 there is no usual secret here 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.439
 in what I put in another frame 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 we put it necessarily on our fence then 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.090
 there is not on the side but here it is right here under 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.890
 our frame is not on the frame but that's it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.060
 here click about the mouse button and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.640
 it turns out with us 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 frame and out another frame but i thought 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.259
 this bug is already common and you 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.939
 know so i now we go in as if 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.430
 frame click the right mouse button 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.229
 be sure to take the red carpet now 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.470
 us green carpet turned to red 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.540
 carpet a little move away but take the green 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 carpet set that is obtained at our 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.430
 2 frames worth the red carpet she 1 frames 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.240
 we don't know green carpet 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.579
 or not but hopefully understood because I 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.110
 it turns out only in vain crucified and 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.409
 now we just take and just 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.299
 switch 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.399
 more precisely, just press about the mouse button 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.980
 here we already have something similar 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.239
 like there now literally left 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.989
 finishing touches 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.200
 we need to turn the fence in asce bricks 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.110
 then I just break myself and put mom and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.900
 put so and put on top of the lamps well 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.700
 The lamp is basically nothing. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.209
 there is nothing special so now I will take 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.280
 the most important thing we put the lever start on 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.190
 frame leave it here on the block that is 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.959
 here well somewhere here here on the right 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.290
 click here and it turns out that we have 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.180
 exactly the same mechanism and it turns out 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.819
 now you can see activated 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.349
 there is it fully working and 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.200
 Basically, he looks pretty nice 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.299
 by the way, notice, that is, I can do everything 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.180
 equal to changing the position of my green 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:59.079
 carpet and I hope you didn't know about it 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.090
 I'm not just here crucified here and 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.220
 I also want to tell you about a small 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.230
 addition to the first one our mind bug 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.959
 it consists in the following that is 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.120
 principle the principle is the same 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.030
 tank we take a wooden fence set 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.299
 two blocks high put on top of it 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.180
 our frame and here we take in principle any 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.470
 thing but i will take anyway pickax 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.299
 We put a pickaxe that is, about the button 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
 We have mice that get skirko 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.859
 is in our favorite frame now 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.720
 we put the second frame that is under our 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.419
 the first frame we press the mouse button 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.889
 now we all go into this frame 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:38.319
 click again on the mouse button 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.150
 set now let's see yes that's all 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.040
 set and now we can principle 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.400
 control and reposition 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.669
 of our our things in this frame 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.370
 it changes you must remember that the first 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.430
 that is , the position changes in 1 frame 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.470
 things just about pressing a mouse button 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.780
 position in the second frame just need 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.080
 go inside and press about the button 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.900
 mouse all 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.480
 we have changed like this 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.810
 small first bug and addition to 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.640
 this first bug I don't know 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.700
 he learned well, so I kind of for myself 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.650
 something new found and immediately you 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.799
 told the third last and enough 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.170
 A known bug is that if 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.550
 create just such a small construction 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.470
 next to her put our favorite 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.130
 piston and activate it all 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.830
 redstone 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.800
 we earn our piston but it's in 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.940
 principle is not so unusual there 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.530
 unusually unusual this tank 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.290
 is as follows that is if we 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.140
 substitute in this piston any block 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.470
 there is here I here I substitute here any 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.690
 block then it turns out it is remade in 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.550
 our wool ie any block that 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.110
 They want a hellish stone and we are here 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.860
 substitute it will be remade in 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.780
 our blog and the one so let me take it away 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.670
 and show you the most important feature 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.460
 that is, what was this bug 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.050
 which I wanted to show you a bug 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.180
 The following was what I am 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.340
 I 'll put a bed in here and set it up 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.390
 any blog yourself 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.580
 Well, let's get some wool here 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.500
 look like as it turns kravat 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.080
 closed and seemingly bed at all 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.090
 there is no here but if i press about the buttons and 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.410
 that the bed will start to appear that is in 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.669
 principle such a mechanism can 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.480
 use to just 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.100
 hide our favorite bed and and all that 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.140
 I donâ€™t know whether the server will be 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.140
 work well here is such a small bug 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.260
 which I discovered myself in principle 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:37.040
 everything as you see behind me amid 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.780
 sunset I showed you all three bugs which 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.390
 I found for the whole 162 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.669
 and of course thanks for watching 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.690
 my video subscribe to the channel 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:50.320
 put huskies and play mine kraft 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.320
 Dear friends
