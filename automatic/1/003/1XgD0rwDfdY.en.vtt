00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
precise with the filling in because the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
precise with the filling in because the
weight<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> sugar<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:19.409> help<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
weight of the sugar will help that to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
weight of the sugar will help that to
spread<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.939> nice<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> it'll<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
spread out really nice and it'll get to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.410 
spread out really nice and it'll get to
the<00:01:21.960> edges<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.430> do<00:01:23.430> help<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> along<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.390> little

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the edges but do help it along a little

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.359 
the edges but do help it along a little
bit<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.520> almost<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> way

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
bit so that it's almost all the way

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:36.540 
bit so that it's almost all the way
spread<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> edges

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.600 

now<00:01:37.510> we're<00:01:37.660> going<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.840> do<00:01:37.960> one<00:01:38.650> color<00:01:39.310> at<00:01:39.580> a
