00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi, here I am here at the first start 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.790
 after updating samsung galaxy s2 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.920
 to android jelly bean 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.290
 now I'll show you that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.849
 this thread I first start that I still have 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.420
 set it up and on the blog they already have me 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.430
 reported that the battery life is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.920
 more scarce than before 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.689
 I suggested from him precisely 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.150
 recalibrate the battery or to do 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.070
 a factory reset if you fail to 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.510
 solve the problem is still owe it 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.870
 then try in the coming days 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.120
 I will also write a mini review 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 however if I can I will also make a video 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.090
 on how I found myself with a new one 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 updating 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:53.660
 let's start in this case I don't know 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:00.480
 the sim away from you now automatic ahead 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:03.020
 this ignores nothing to position aiom 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.020
 Arts 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 enough is part of it and I can't jump 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:23.160
 so you can jump 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:25.470
 ok ok other things about a place after ok 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 the formal act we learned from 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 use ok let's see so much now 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.420
 surely it will be fast since that too 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.190
 before it was fast nothing to see 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.100
 the version now will not mister or make 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.970
 see how it works let's see center 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.370
 notifications 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.820
 here is notification center as you can see 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.630
 has slightly changed black background 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.540
 compared to the background and let's say gray by 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.760
 no one first made these look 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.750
 links but this is power 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.710
 control 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:07.500
 as we can see also here is the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:13.680
 plus the setting for hourly brightness 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.570
 larger here a pil to shortcuts for 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560
 revenue of a fast settings 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.959
 faster 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.810
 now doing some screens so i will 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.300
 it seems that it was even more fluid 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.959
 now maybe my impression 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.800
 phone info we end up going down 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.050
 android 4.1.2 now the time of 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.410
 approve it see even if 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.170
 applications are compatible with others 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.489
 others maybe improvements or bugs that yes 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 may present with this 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.850
 update is indeed century of doing 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.910
 a review on the blog or if there is 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.080
 let them give you a short video for the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.610
 that's all 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.610
 the next hello
