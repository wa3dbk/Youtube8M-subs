00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone a big hello in this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.700
 video let's talk about the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.589
 micronutrients now what are the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.120
 micronutrients we always have to make 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.860
 of the macronutrients but the same 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.809
 customers that are the micronutrients 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 they are simply your vitamins and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.609
 minerals like that is always the vitamins 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.410
 The truth is it is reflected so I am 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.449
 playing the vitamins that we know 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 normally and minerals now I'm going to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.439
 try to explain this to you in the way 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.539
 as simple as possible, let's start with the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.130
 vitamins vitamins are compounds 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.480
 heterogeneous essentials for 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 life that by ingesting them in a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.030
 balanced and in essential doses 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.770
 promote the correct functioning 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.719
 physical most vitamins 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 essentials can not be elaborated by 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.540
 the body so it can not 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 get them more than through ingestion 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 activity of vitamins contained in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 natural births and blah blah blah blah 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 blah if you're on a caloric plan of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.600
 maintenance or in a caloric plan 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.030
 of gaining muscle mass and you follow a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 healthy diet or your vegetables of the day 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.520
 with your healthy carbohydrates with your 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 protein and with one or two fruits a day 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 your body will be receiving the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.250
 vitamins you need to function 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.450
 correctly so it's not a subject 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.700
 so much to worry about 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.130
 and now if you do not eat very healthily or 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.290
 you're on a weight loss plan for 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.410
 your caloric deficit is likely not 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 you reach the vitamin levels that 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.100
 you need every day that's why if you're 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.470
 a plan to lose weight with deficit 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.360
 caloric is very likely and recommended 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 that you need to use a multivitamin 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.800
 while you 're losing weight to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.560
 moment you go back to calories from 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.630
 maintenance not so necessary now the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.100
 minerals minerals are elements 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.900
 essential chemicals for the normal 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 metabolic functioning play a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.020
 very important role in the body and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.910
 that are necessary for the elaboration 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 of tissues synthesis of hormones and in the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.350
 most of the chemical reactions 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.940
 in which the enzymes now intervene 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 with minerals is exactly what 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.740
 same if you're in ranges 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.900
 Caloric weight maintenance or 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.820
 gain muscle mass and you're on a diet 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.290
 healthy you do not have to worry about 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 this is not your body either 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.680
 probably receiving the minerals 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.660
 you need now we are not going to enter 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.670
 talk in detail about vitamins and 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.190
 minerals one by one because I want 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 keep this as simple as possible for 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.599
 all in cases like this less is more 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.540
 so that was it for this video and 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.440
 see you very soon take care of chan chan 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.330
 warning if you follow a plan 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.489
 totally vegetarian food 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.739
 extremely low in protein and 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.870
 healthy fats please consult with 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.910
 your doctor or community nutritionist more 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.400
 close to determine an appropriate plan 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.830
 of supplementation according to your 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.959
 variants to be able to reach their 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.239
 levels of micronutrients 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.190
 day the micronutrient deficiency to 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.080
 long term especially of minerals 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.880
 can lead to health problems and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.880
 very serious immunological problems
