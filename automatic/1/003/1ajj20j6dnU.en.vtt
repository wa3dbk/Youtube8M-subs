00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 well review video of this 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.480
 bluetooth amplifier to listen to the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 own cell phone music in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.070
 bicycle in my case though of a plus 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.619
 normally in the car to listen to a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 movies with good sound for both 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.720
 fixed laptop and that for the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 our tablet 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 then this is my new one 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.789
 amplifier there is a small button here for 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.880
 the ignition at 5 hours of autonomy one 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 400 million battery 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.200
 I prolongly pressed to make it go 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.910
 immediately in automatic mode 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 bluetooth for bad setup was 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 easy in the past to turn on here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.870
 bluetooth and done searching devices 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.870
 it will couple very easily coupled 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 sound 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.350
 the audio we can increase the volume 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.660
 of the audio by long pressing here 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.970
 there you see it then to you from there but there is more 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:15.210
 and less because everything in the little is seen 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:18.680
 now he puts it to the maximum I can tie 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.680
 we do better horizontally 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.590
 this is my voice to follow the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.590
 power 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.610
 hands down 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 I'm thinking of you as I walk while 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.680
 pazzini 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.320
 interesting that while listening to the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.660
 car music if I get one 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 I answer the call via radio 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.950
 I practically listen to the phone call in 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.230
 voice from the speakers is a very thing 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.650
 comfortable for the car we saw 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.709
 that makes these lights 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.170
 you can manage the lights by pressing the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.480
 button in the center practically if it is 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.730
 I push the lights always stay on or 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.099
 otherwise always off in this case 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.799
 let's go to save the battery or 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.950
 pressing once again returns to giving 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.819
 the equalizer effect that is seen only 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.760
 when is that the volume becomes high in 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.870
 more then this is the way to manage them 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.640
 so if I press I pause again 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.209
 does play so I can manage without having 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.760
 the phone if I press a lot 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.280
 increase the volume I press so much with so much 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.680
 time the volume decreases if I was 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.409
 just one more change song then 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 play to start it 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:15.400
 in the middle so change song but in front 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 but of euro 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:25.920
 this is the button for 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:27.510
 answer or stick to ready as 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.520
 you hear me I'm doing a crossroads i'm 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.120
 doing a test, you feel good 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.840
 I struggled quite a bit muffled at 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.530
 let's see a little then now you hear me 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.100
 same touched the mother with speakerphone with 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.100
 speakerphone 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.640
 something that gives you a gift 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.170
 that I did because it makes me feel the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.690
 car music and thousand voices in 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:59.739
 machine lowers the role of me a little 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:02.670
 feel good i feel ok perfect okay 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.110
 then I am waiting a moment wait 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.900
 I have attached the phone so I am 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.420
 managed to stick with the small button 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.540
 here little button now lying about 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.590
 let you see it 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.609
 here it is 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.729
 this is the little button in attaching the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.949
 call instead under I show you 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.240
 under a lot of zoom arcs a little way 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.260
 I see him a little better since he came 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.510
 ok below we have the usb reader for 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.880
 mp3s so we can put the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.630
 our mp3 music or better still the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.729
 micro sd 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.889
 we put in the memory with our 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.270
 songs 100 songs what it is and there 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.500
 we have our own device 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.150
 charging in 3 hours and audio input not 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.560
 we know we don't have a device 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.139
 with bluetooth because pairing is 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.569
 very easy and it is 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.909
 it was with the general android mode 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.490
 with everyone I think it's a moment that 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.999
 he recognized it instantly 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.870
 audio input 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:03.569
 if we put charles audio input 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.569
 ok tells us audio then so that is 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:09.300
 practically bacco the cable the cable is enough 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.099
 put it in the headphone out or at the exit 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.629
 of the computer sum lucia use of the 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.629
 computer and hear us 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.830
 here too the maximum audio by pressing more 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.350
 that beautiful feature that i 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.730
 basic models do not have those that 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.970
 they call bought in the past that 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.010
 they cost slightly less than there is 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.840
 a good autonomy then 5 hours 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.210
 autonomy and so much the battery 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.860
 finally a good battery and together 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.280
 the speakers are also the most powerful battery 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.200
 I know really powerful this comes from 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.290
 maybe a Chinese site will put you there too 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.020
 the link in the description as always from 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.520
 china it takes 15 40 days its uses 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.500
 of economic mail then maybe 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.140
 better to spend one more dive 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.780
 to make it arrive with the courier with the 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.860
 economic mail came to 32 euros charges 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.860
 shipping included
