okay today I'm going to show you a few

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.450 
okay today I'm going to show you a few
tricks<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.510> get<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> wheel<00:00:04.350> nut<00:00:04.650> wheel<00:00:05.190> bolt

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
tricks how to get a wheel nut wheel bolt

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.309 
tricks how to get a wheel nut wheel bolt
off<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.420> wheel<00:00:06.600> nut<00:00:06.810> on

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
off and a wheel nut on

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.370 
off and a wheel nut on
the<00:00:08.010> first<00:00:08.250> trick<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:09.080> just<00:00:10.080> use<00:00:10.110> some

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the first trick is to just use some

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.240 
the first trick is to just use some
penetrating<00:00:11.990> blaster<00:00:12.990> or<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.259> PD<00:00:13.769> blaster

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
penetrating blaster or a PD blaster

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.160 
penetrating blaster or a PD blaster
whatever<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> knock<00:00:15.599> corrosion<00:00:16.049> off

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
whatever you have to knock corrosion off

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.849 
whatever you have to knock corrosion off
or<00:00:16.500> help<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.430> loose<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> put

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
or help get it loose so you want to put

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.470 
or help get it loose so you want to put
your<00:00:20.010> nut<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.789> way<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> most

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
your nut on that way you get the most

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.290 
your nut on that way you get the most
surface<00:00:21.750> area<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:23.130> knock<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.519> out<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
surface area to knock it out and you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700 
surface area to knock it out and you
also<00:00:24.449> don't<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.320> straight

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
also don't want to just do it straight

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
also don't want to just do it straight
up<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.430> hit<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.019> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
up and to hit it because if you do that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
up and to hit it because if you do that
you'll<00:00:28.740> end<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:28.980> mushrooming<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> end<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
you'll end up mushrooming the end and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.849 
you'll end up mushrooming the end and
then<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:30.599> you're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> reuse<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.500> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
then if you're going to reuse that you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.700 
then if you're going to reuse that you
don't<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.469> you<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
don't want to do that so you go on and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.250 
don't want to do that so you go on and
put<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.040> too<00:00:35.219> far<00:00:35.489> alright<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.480> again<00:00:36.750> mushroom

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
put on too far alright so again mushroom

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
put on too far alright so again mushroom
it<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> don't<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it out so and you don't want it just to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299 
it out so and you don't want it just to
pthreads<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.230> you've<00:00:40.440> ruined<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
pthreads on that way you've ruined the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.389 
pthreads on that way you've ruined the
threads<00:00:41.550> also<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> want<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
threads also so you want it on just a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.080 
threads also so you want it on just a
little<00:00:44.430> past<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.270> end<00:00:46.010> there<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
little past the end there and then you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
little past the end there and then you
just<00:00:48.300> hit<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> few<00:00:49.469> good<00:00:49.500> times<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
just hit it a few good times with the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.479 
just hit it a few good times with the
hammer<00:00:50.489> about<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.980> three<00:00:53.309> good

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
hammer about one you know three good

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.439 
hammer about one you know three good
hits<00:00:53.899> powerful<00:00:54.899> hit<00:00:55.050> should<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:56.449> now

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
hits powerful hit should get it off now

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.660 
hits powerful hit should get it off now
again<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.550> bit

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
again get one on is a little bit

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
again get one on is a little bit
different<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.079> few<00:01:01.530> things<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.859> can

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
different there's a few things you can

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.320 
different there's a few things you can
do<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.510> easy<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> see

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
do and the one I have is easy so see

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
do and the one I have is easy so see
this<00:01:09.450> gap<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.820> want<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
this gap in the back and then I want to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
this gap in the back and then I want to
get<00:01:11.970> rid<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.229> either<00:01:13.320> put

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
get rid of that so you can either put

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
get rid of that so you can either put
everything<00:01:13.920> together<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.030> wheel<00:01:15.240> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
everything together get your wheel on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.499 
everything together get your wheel on
and<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:16.140> tighten<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.560> all<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.820> spec<00:01:18.119> but

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and then tighten it all down to spec but

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
and then tighten it all down to spec but
you're<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.409> sure<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> tightens<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you're not sure if this tightens all the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.830 
you're not sure if this tightens all the
way<00:01:21.180> back<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.400> another<00:01:23.400> way<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
way back so another way to do this is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
way back so another way to do this is
you<00:01:25.830> grab<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> few<00:01:26.310> washers<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> put<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.180> on

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you grab a few washers you put them on

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
you grab a few washers you put them on
and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.590> drive<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.340> nut<00:01:30.150> down

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and then you just drive your nut down

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.950 
and then you just drive your nut down
that's<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:32.040> okay<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.659> going

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that's that's okay but you're not going

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
that's that's okay but you're not going
to<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.670> trying

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to really have this going to be trying

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
to really have this going to be trying
so<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.020> hard<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so it's going to be a little hard what I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
so it's going to be a little hard what I
do<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.180> grab<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.420> 13<00:01:39.900> millimeter<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.650> anything

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
do is grab a 13 millimeter or anything

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.980 
do is grab a 13 millimeter or anything
that<00:01:41.130> goes<00:01:41.909> around<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> diameter<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that goes around the diameter of the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.819 
that goes around the diameter of the
bolt<00:01:43.310> put<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.850> rest<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.049> against

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
bolt put it on and just rest it against

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.550 
bolt put it on and just rest it against
something<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:48.060> way<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.540> leverage<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
something that way you have leverage you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.730 
something that way you have leverage you
know<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.960> next<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> want<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.500> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
know so next thing you want to do is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.550 
know so next thing you want to do is
