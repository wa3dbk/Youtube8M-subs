I'm Dion Higden and I'm gonna tell you a

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.520 
I'm Dion Higden and I'm gonna tell you a
little<00:00:08.639> bit<00:00:08.790> about<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.210> new<00:00:09.330> Garmin<00:00:09.750> GPS<00:00:09.960> map

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
little bit about the new Garmin GPS map

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.330 
little bit about the new Garmin GPS map
1040s<00:00:11.340> XS<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:13.559> coolest<00:00:13.889> thing<00:00:14.070> about<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
1040s XS it the coolest thing about it

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.180 
1040s XS it the coolest thing about it
is<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.240> fast<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.870> works<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.590> 10<00:00:16.890> Hertz

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
is is how fast it works the 10 Hertz

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.880 
is is how fast it works the 10 Hertz
deal<00:00:17.520> makes<00:00:18.300> such<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> huge<00:00:18.990> difference<00:00:19.470> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
deal makes such a huge difference in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950 
deal makes such a huge difference in
fish<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.850> spot<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.480> pull<00:00:21.689> up<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
fish in a spot when you pull up on a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080 
fish in a spot when you pull up on a
spot<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.070> never<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.640> past<00:00:23.910> your

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
spot you know you never go past your

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.870 
spot you know you never go past your
spot<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.960> by<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> being<00:00:26.130> 10<00:00:26.340> Hertz<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
spot and and by that being 10 Hertz it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
spot and and by that being 10 Hertz it
updates<00:00:27.420> itself<00:00:27.900> ten<00:00:28.619> times<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.220> second

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
updates itself ten times a second

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.669 
updates itself ten times a second
so<00:00:30.179> therefore<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.869> you're<00:00:31.019> creeping<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.590> on

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so therefore when you're creeping up on

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
so therefore when you're creeping up on
your<00:00:31.859> best<00:00:32.040> GPS<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.239> never<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.600> past<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
your best GPS but you never go past it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
your best GPS but you never go past it
you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.500> never<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.430> your

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you know you never get you know you your

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
you know you never get you know you your
unit<00:00:36.450> keeps<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.290> every<00:00:37.739> move<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
unit keeps up with you every move you

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310 
unit keeps up with you every move you
make<00:00:38.460> every<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.820> your<00:00:39.000> boat<00:00:39.180> changes<00:00:39.989> angle

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
make every time your boat changes angle

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.630 
make every time your boat changes angle
and<00:00:40.440> everything<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.920> keeps<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and everything it keeps up with you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
and everything it keeps up with you
because<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.660> faster<00:00:43.200> than<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
because it's so much faster than the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.709 
because it's so much faster than the
other<00:00:43.590> units<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.969> neat<00:00:45.120> thing<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
other units the neat thing about it is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.080 
other units the neat thing about it is
standard<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.559> Garmin<00:00:47.309> units<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.910> now

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
standard on all Garmin units right now

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
standard on all Garmin units right now
another<00:00:48.870> neat<00:00:49.110> feature<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.340> 1040

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
another neat feature on the on the 1040

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.680 
another neat feature on the on the 1040
XS<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.360> depth<00:00:52.050> range<00:00:52.649> shading<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.480> what

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
XS is depth range shading what that what

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
XS is depth range shading what that what
that<00:00:54.719> does<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.559> set<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> certain

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that does is you can set it on a certain

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
that does is you can set it on a certain
and<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> other

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and it's not you know a lot of the other

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
and it's not you know a lot of the other
units<00:00:59.039> got<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> competitors

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
units got it a lot of the competitors

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
units got it a lot of the competitors
have<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.920> unique<00:01:02.280> feel<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
have that but the unique feel about it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.299 
have that but the unique feel about it
is<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.780> shades<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> certain<00:01:04.500> depth<00:01:04.710> range<00:01:04.979> so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
is is it shades a certain depth range so

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.100 
is is it shades a certain depth range so
you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.610> set<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.360> depth<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you can set it on what depth you want it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
you can set it on what depth you want it
to<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> next<00:01:08.640> thing<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> can

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to be and then the next thing you can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.870 
to be and then the next thing you can
use<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:09.600> makes<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.140> very<00:01:10.470> key<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
use which makes that very key is the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020 
use which makes that very key is the
dynamic<00:01:12.420> quake<00:01:12.630> level<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.830> basically<00:01:14.520> as

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
dynamic quake level you can basically as

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
dynamic quake level you can basically as
you're<00:01:15.360> riding<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> lake<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> morning

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you're riding to the lake in the morning

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.870 
you're riding to the lake in the morning
and<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.890> listening<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> radio<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and you're listening to the radio and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
and you're listening to the radio and
you<00:01:17.970> hear<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> lake<00:01:19.020> level<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.860> five

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you hear the lake level is at five

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
you hear the lake level is at five
ninety<00:01:20.670> nine<00:01:20.850> today<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.710> can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
ninety nine today you know you can

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
ninety nine today you know you can
actually<00:01:23.130> put<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> into<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.150> unit<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
actually put that into this unit and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually put that into this unit and
what<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.590> does<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.700> shades<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> area<00:01:27.720> on

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
what that does is it shades the area on

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
what that does is it shades the area on
the<00:01:28.560> same<00:01:28.829> map<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.579> show<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> lake

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the same map and show you what the lake

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.740 
the same map and show you what the lake
level<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.520> by<00:01:32.520> adjusting<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.030> dynamic<00:01:33.299> lake

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
level is by adjusting my dynamic lake

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
level is by adjusting my dynamic lake
level<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:35.009> show<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.030> lake<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
level on here to show that the lake is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.530 
level on here to show that the lake is
ten<00:01:36.689> feet<00:01:36.900> low<00:01:37.110> today<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.670> green<00:01:38.970> area<00:01:39.420> on

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
ten feet low today now the green area on

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.249 
ten feet low today now the green area on
the<00:01:39.659> map<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> actually<00:01:41.130> dry<00:01:41.430> ground<00:01:41.790> now

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
the map here is actually dry ground now

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
the map here is actually dry ground now
when<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> change<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.680> lake<00:01:43.979> level<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
when I change the lake level to be to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
when I change the lake level to be to
show<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.600> being<00:01:45.780> ten<00:01:46.110> foot<00:01:46.350> low<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.280> depth

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
show it being ten foot low the depth
