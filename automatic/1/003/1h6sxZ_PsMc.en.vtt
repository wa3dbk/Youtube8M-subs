be<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.230> full<00:05:22.470> partner<00:05:22.500> anyway<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:23.480> well<00:05:24.480> you

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
be a full partner anyway so well you

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.610 
be a full partner anyway so well you
think<00:05:24.690> about<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:24.930> this<00:05:25.080> was<00:05:25.260> actually<00:05:25.440> a

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
think about it this was actually a

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.710 
think about it this was actually a
pretty<00:05:25.890> amazing<00:05:26.160> game<00:05:26.610> right<00:05:27.180> not<00:05:27.390> for<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
pretty amazing game right not for the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.530 
pretty amazing game right not for the
fact<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.260> was<00:05:28.380> 40<00:05:28.740> minutes<00:05:29.010> long<00:05:29.220> and

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
fact that it was 40 minutes long and

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.030 
fact that it was 40 minutes long and
nothing<00:05:30.540> really<00:05:30.870> happened<00:05:31.260> for<00:05:31.440> a<00:05:31.470> long<00:05:31.680> while

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
nothing really happened for a long while

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.910 
nothing really happened for a long while
but<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.820> concept<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.420> it<00:05:33.570> is<00:05:33.720> amazing<00:05:34.350> right

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
but the concept of it is amazing right

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.810 
but the concept of it is amazing right
you<00:05:35.430> have<00:05:35.610> an<00:05:36.000> overpowering<00:05:36.600> Zerg<00:05:36.930> force<00:05:37.820> they

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
you have an overpowering Zerg force they

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.120 
you have an overpowering Zerg force they
kill<00:05:39.450> one<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:40.020> players<00:05:40.230> one<00:05:40.920> of<00:05:41.010> them

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
kill one of the players one of them

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.160 
kill one of the players one of them
drops<00:05:41.550> probably<00:05:42.150> that's<00:05:42.390> thought<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.870> think

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
drops probably that's thought I think

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.070 
drops probably that's thought I think
happens<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:45.180> retard<00:05:45.600> of<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.840> group

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
happens and the retard of the group

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.920 
happens and the retard of the group
which<00:05:46.380> probably<00:05:47.310> well<00:05:47.700> was<00:05:48.180> used<00:05:48.690> to

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
which probably well was used to

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.370 
which probably well was used to
piggybacking<00:05:49.530> ah<00:05:49.950> on<00:05:50.910> his<00:05:51.570> opponent<00:05:52.110> is<00:05:52.200> on
