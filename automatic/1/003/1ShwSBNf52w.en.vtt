00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.110
 Ecuador 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.160
 Of course you are super good mother of mine 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 are going to take the optique to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.529
 be the new the new sniper of the year is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.940
 amazing 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.330
 but good, good morning everyone 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.040
 favor and welcome to black ops 2 against 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 we 're all going to play with the franc and 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.700
 talk about the snipers because 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 I want to see other trancon shooters like 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.250
 This has been clearly the title 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.990
 the title is a parody you will not see 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.730
 a phenomenally good game neither 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.760
 much less and much less in fact the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 game did not win the first against 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 all in fact it is the first against all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 who plays with him with the sniper not what 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 I won that yes it was second but good 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.560
 I think it's quite entertaining not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.360
 is 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.940
 is not complete healthy is not the part 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.140
 full are like clicks or is cut 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.970
 the game because there were moments 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.320
 in those who die they die I die and that is 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.510
 I'm not happy to bring you 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.440
 games of those who die and die but 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.750
 well I want to talk about the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.080
 snipers because you know that those 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.670
 if you follow axel ya dualde on twitter 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 which are the only two youtubers that 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.850
 they were tweeting a lot about the game 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.340
 that they both have the game from the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.140
 Thursday and the servers opened the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.510
 silos opened on Saturday morning or 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.060
 Saturday night but good in the end 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.040
 carrying enough already played this 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.200
 axel has already passed prestige is a 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.490
 vice of cojones mother mine is incredible 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.500
 but good 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.939
 if you follow him you know that they have been 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.860
 tweeting many of the transients 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.030
 they are totally seated and well is 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.649
 true I've tried it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.840
 the first thing I've tried in this game 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.060
 It has been reaching level 4 to bring 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.740
 to be able to create a class and create me 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 the class is from the neighborhood is between 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.369
 quotes that is not a barret if you see it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.520
 it seems quite Alvarez but this is not 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.560
 my automatic is that is , beige red 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.539
 and every bullet that shoots has to do 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.730
 the manual action to make red tea 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.650
 but well nothing happens 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.330
 and good now is that it is very true 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.790
 very true they are pretty or worse 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.050
 let's say no night is 2 and over power 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.990
 but the other weapons weapons 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.520
 normal the jumps put their rifles 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.840
 they need more bullets than usual and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 another habit to the call of duty you know 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.950
 than usual to kill with their 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.890
 rifles or with assault rifles are three 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 bullets for good to kill in this call 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.850
 of duty you do not need to have a bullet 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.460
 you need 45 there are only a few 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.620
 weapons that I really do not remember the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.060
 names but there are few weapons that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.710
 Kill only three bullets 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.720
 we are obviously talking about 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.950
 from far away or from any weapon of the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.570
 game except for snipers 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.970
 like this one they talk like we're like 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.530
 we are talking kill three bullets by 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.290
 so that makes the brakes tenor 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.790
 they are over power and that is what makes 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.700
 also these borders are in the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.190
 power then good very good at aiming with 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.290
 look at it and that they before you 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 disparate they shoot you for so much 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.470
 you know that they need like four 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.920
 bullets minimum three bullets minimum for 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.320
 kill by giving you a bullet you look almost 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.730
 almost almost that it does not move to the sight 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.530
 you're pointing the franco not 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.030
 physically move nothing therefore that 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.010
 it facilitates a lot 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.900
 that you click is like doing draft 2 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.670
 whatever it is for what it's basically 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.940
 therefore that makes the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.260
 transactions are or are sitting and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.590
 that need a rebalancing 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.030
 obviously soon treyarch goes 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.770
 to rebalance the snipers because 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.319
 is that as I say is an outrage this 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.459
 specific weapon this barrett between 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.900
 quotes that is that it was not traded 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.220
 what's it called I'm reading it here I think 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.960
 what is u s50 or that ere do not know I do not know 50 no 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.940
 I know what 50 caliber obviously 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.710
 will be like and will be quite in point 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.690
 it takes to do the quick if that is that in 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.100
 this white you are not there 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.440
 precipitation pro modern warfare2 or 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.060
 what is quickly drawn in the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.890
 modern warfare 3 to aim faster 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.720
 with the look there is not or for or not worth 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.640
 for snipers therefore 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.020
 that 's a point in favor of the game of 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.640
 white that is quite balanced in 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.500
 As for classes, you find advantages 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.920
 can is quite balanced already 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.210
 we'll talk about it another day but 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.650
 removing this sniper there is a 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.420
 sniper that yes it takes very 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.100
 little to point out that he's the ballista 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.140
 This takes very little time to aim or 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.490
 far less than this barrett like 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.260
 watering this quote quotes that I do not 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.210
 agreement how it's called but it takes 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.330
 pretty little point and that makes 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.370
 the people that are good sniper 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.410
 so that it is tremendously good if you 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.260
 with your four or five lettering submachine gun 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.750
 bullets to kill and he only needs 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.970
 a single bullet with a range of hip 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.050
 up a single bullet from one 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.280
 shot one kill 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.700
 because that makes the rebounders 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.110
 totally over power and is what there is not 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.800
 it's compensated, you're probably not 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.150
 you have already tried them but only 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.100
 you have the game from 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.500
 since two days ago I have it from the 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.140
 Monday as yesterday they went up boxing and 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.900
 and well, leave below what you think 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.580
 that they must patch to make the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.980
 snipers be a little bit worse 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.930
 I think it's easy what you owe what 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.690
 that they must patch is not the quick 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.450
 scope itself but when they are pointing 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.790
 and Tunisia from a single bullet in the sights 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.230
 go to take it by ass or is it points 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.730
 with the frank does he try to do 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.950
 the quick scope right now you read 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.350
 shoot and looks at it practically does not 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.600
 moves follows its rhythm instead if it 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.139
 patch so they would need that make the 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.330
 soccer be 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.530
 that is bound to fail if you give it 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.550
 therefore that makes the 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.430
 snipers 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.110
 the mercedes quite pretty well that 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.419
 It is my opinion to leave here below 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.189
 all ways what is your pine about 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.960
 the snipers if you do not want that 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.509
 the patch does not need the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.610
 patch no or whatever but good is my 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.659
 opinion I very clearly crash knows 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.340
 who need it 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.069
 is that they have to patch because it is 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.379
 that is a pass is a past is that 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.090
 they are very expensive the ballista this mushroom and 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.189
 ximo sã is that I was ready that 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.960
 is that I say no sense 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.789
 meaningful time but there it is 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.379
 I guess tomorrow will patch has 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.210
 gone next week but we're going 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.080
 to patch yes or yes I hope that you 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.060
 has liked this first gameplay 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.009
 commented talking about the 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.319
 sniper is not my specialty nor 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.750
 much less you already commented 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.969
 but hey, I had to talk about this 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.319
 this event that we were going from the process 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.849
 because it gives me the laugh of 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.930
 these of these snipers good 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.379
 come a greeting and see you next time 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.379
 goodbye
