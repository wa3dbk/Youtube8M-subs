tamiflu<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.440> rabbit<00:01:44.800> hole<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:49.090> is

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
tamiflu in the the rabbit hole this is

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.920 
tamiflu in the the rabbit hole this is
the<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:50.440> whole<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:51.130> had<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.580> squeeze<00:01:52.360> through

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
the the whole we had to squeeze through

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.020 
the the whole we had to squeeze through
and<00:01:53.410> that's<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.280> little<00:01:54.520> bit<00:01:54.610> easier<00:01:54.910> because

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
and that's a little bit easier because

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.090 
and that's a little bit easier because
it<00:01:55.210> was<00:01:55.330> really<00:01:55.600> wet<00:01:55.900> yesterday<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.590> slippery

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
it was really wet yesterday and slippery

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.190 
it was really wet yesterday and slippery
so<00:01:57.880> think<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.150> kind<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.360> slipped<00:01:58.690> through<00:01:58.930> but

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
so think we kind of slipped through but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.890 
so think we kind of slipped through but
you<00:01:59.680> kind<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.070> get<00:02:00.160> stuck<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.660> winds

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
you kind of get stuck and it winds

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:11.580 
you kind of get stuck and it winds
around<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.040> other<00:02:03.070> side

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.650
