00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.090
 hey again now wanted to try 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.870
 we have a brown one 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.760
 brought form 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.760
 even with a grid 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.750
 that's the whole thing 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.400
 and I just wanted to 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.410
 I'm curious how it works 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.390
 The recipe works as usual 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.509
 below in the video description then na 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.509
 Come on 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:33.410
 you need 200 grams of double frame 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.980
 cream cheese 150 grams sugar three eggs 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.260
 a bottle of butter vanilla aroma 200 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.800
 grams of tender bitter chocolate 80 grams 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.550
 flour half a teaspoon of salt 66 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.440
 grams of margarine and 100 milliliters of milk 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:56.260
 for the cs cream you give the cream cheese 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:00.129
 Add 535 grams of sugar to a bowl 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.129
 and beat the whole body 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.520
 then an egg and a third of the butter 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.520
 to give vanilla aroma and stir 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.060
 put the crow first to the side 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.860
 Break the chocolate into coarse pieces 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.320
 and about 5 minutes at about 270 watts 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.320
 melts 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.430
 in a small bowl you have to do that 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.430
 flour together with the salt 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.870
 then you are in a separate 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.870
 bowl off the margarine 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 in the meantime of course the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.760
 Bring chocolate out of the microwave 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 stir and cool down a bit first 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.080
 to let 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.280
 Give the margarine 105 grams 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.280
 sugar and stop first 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.989
 the two eggs beat into it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.019
 because the milk and the festive vanilla 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.019
 add aroma 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.189
 mix everything well 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.070
 then you give the melting chocolate 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.070
 just on it 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.099
 and leads again 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:14.670
 Finally, you give the new 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:17.450
 mix and mix it into one 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.450
 minutes brand 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.830
 the finished chocolate part you can then 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.830
 Distribute directly in the industry 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 smooth out something and quickly 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.680
 with a tablespoon ran cream cheese 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.680
 Cream the king on it 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.950
 to get my mom structure 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.170
 you then only with a spoon the 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.670
 do something to whirl around without missing the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.450
 Wise cream with the dark cream too 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 very to mix 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.959
 if you work with the separation grid 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.479
 Do you want to let this happen now 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.039
 whole about 30 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.039
 open in a preheated oven 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.510
 is the time back over leave 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.440
 brownies until bottling and can then 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.440
 Get out of shape 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.560
 It's so easy with this form 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.480
 By placing the frame with this frame 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.610
 back only hits that goes there 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.350
 Carefully removed and finished the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.300
 18 small brown to serve 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.400
 I even forgot the form 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.530
 but find it still had everything 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.870
 Wonderful if you solve that 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.630
 Bake brownies without separating grid-volt to 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.340
 eg to get larger brawnies or one 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.770
 more typical brownie looking too 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.080
 I would get the tin with before 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.160
 Bake paper interpret so later on 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.160
 do not cut the shape scratched 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:39.519
 and here again fast smooth 

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:41.800
 delete larger and deeper 

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:43.689
 to get marbling you have to 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.080
 a spoonful of deep troughs in chocolate 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.809
 in front 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.089
 the pour in cream cheese cream and 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:51.569
 This then again with the sport something 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.569
 cover 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.090
 Finally, count the whole thing a bit 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.160
 here too you leave the baked dough 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.080
 first we cool off in front of them 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.590
 mold and from the floor sheet brings around him 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.590
 to cut 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.009
 we still have it cool after that 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.009
 an hour in the fridge 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.060
 whether with race use or without me 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.900
 find the shape is definitely yours 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.790
 worth money 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.990
 the link to this I have you down in the 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.970
 video description set 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.790
 but of course the whole works in the same way 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.920
 normal sheet metal and so see the 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.920
 finished brownie without racing use 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.720
 I think come here through the 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.260
 interfaces the marbling a lot 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.260
 better to the validity 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.850
 and we have the finished mario bros 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.850
 Have fun with neighbors
