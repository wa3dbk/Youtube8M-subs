00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
about compression and this is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.029 
about compression and this is
compression<00:00:28.929> in<00:00:29.199> regards<00:00:29.589> to<00:00:29.679> not<00:00:29.890> only

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
compression in regards to not only

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.370 
compression in regards to not only
improving<00:00:30.550> your<00:00:30.880> performance<00:00:31.599> during<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:32.169> hard

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
improving your performance during a hard

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.370 
improving your performance during a hard
workout<00:00:32.710> or<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.920> race<00:00:33.190> or<00:00:33.910> any<00:00:34.090> run<00:00:34.390> but

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
workout or a race or any run but

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.100 
workout or a race or any run but
actually<00:00:35.920> with<00:00:36.460> your<00:00:36.610> recovery<00:00:37.110> between

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
actually with your recovery between

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.680 
actually with your recovery between
workouts<00:00:38.800> in<00:00:39.100> between<00:00:39.460> running<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.390> what<00:00:40.570> you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
workouts in between running and what you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.920 
workouts in between running and what you
do<00:00:40.870> after<00:00:41.650> you<00:00:42.400> finished<00:00:43.150> with<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.390> race<00:00:43.630> or

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
do after you finished with a race or

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.490 
do after you finished with a race or
workout<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.740> so<00:00:45.840> obviously<00:00:46.840> this<00:00:47.020> is<00:00:47.200> a<00:00:47.230> plug

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
workout and so obviously this is a plug

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.520

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
compression socks when it was cold if

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.219 
compression socks when it was cold if
you<00:01:06.369> see<00:01:06.549> some<00:01:06.759> old<00:01:07.000> videos<00:01:07.330> of<00:01:07.360> me<00:01:07.689> running<00:01:08.020> in

you see some old videos of me running in
Michigan<00:01:09.040> in<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.220> winter<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:10.030> was<00:01:10.149> pretty

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
Michigan in the winter it was pretty

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.190 
Michigan in the winter it was pretty
cold<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.869> like<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.200> wear<00:01:11.380> them<00:01:11.590> for<00:01:12.070> that

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.990 

so<00:01:18.200> start<00:01:18.500> off<00:01:18.530> by<00:01:18.710> talking<00:01:18.859> about<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.729> full

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
so start off by talking about the full

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.130 
so start off by talking about the full
sock<00:01:20.329> which<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:20.719> see<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:21.229> my<00:01:21.469> right<00:01:21.740> leg<00:01:22.250> here

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
sock which you see on my right leg here

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.349 
sock which you see on my right leg here
this<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.350> compressed<00:01:24.979> sport<00:01:25.340> full<00:01:25.640> sock<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
this is a compressed sport full sock and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.620 
this is a compressed sport full sock and
it's<00:01:26.689> more<00:01:27.109> ideal<00:01:27.439> for<00:01:27.670> recovery<00:01:28.670> after<00:01:29.299> a<00:01:29.329> run

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's more ideal for recovery after a run

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.649 
it's more ideal for recovery after a run
I<00:01:29.899> use<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.409> on<00:01:30.469> plane<00:01:30.799> flights<00:01:31.219> it's<00:01:32.179> great<00:01:32.450> for

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
I use it on plane flights it's great for

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.679 
I use it on plane flights it's great for
post-workout<00:01:33.380> recovery<00:01:34.119> post-race<00:01:35.119> recovery

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
post-workout recovery post-race recovery

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.889 
post-workout recovery post-race recovery
and<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.709> pressure<00:01:37.009> is<00:01:37.509> graduated<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:38.719> it's

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
and the pressure is graduated so it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.349 
and the pressure is graduated so it's
actually<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.740> opposite<00:01:40.399> of<00:01:40.609> what<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.060> find

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
actually the opposite of what you find

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.199 
actually the opposite of what you find
in<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.869> race<00:01:42.109> performance<00:01:42.979> castes<00:01:43.819> which<00:01:44.060> I

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
in the race performance castes which I

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.230 
in the race performance castes which I
wear<00:01:44.450> during<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.319> race<00:01:45.819> so<00:01:46.819> if<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.000> want<00:01:47.149> up

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
some of the detail of the compressed

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.520 
some of the detail of the compressed
sport<00:01:49.459> full<00:01:49.759> sock<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:50.720> actually<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> v-2

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
help promote that blood circulation and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.020 
help promote that blood circulation and
blood<00:02:07.849> flow<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.860> great<00:02:09.860> saw<00:02:10.069> from<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.459> sprint

committee microbes because people get

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.509 
committee microbes because people get
you<00:02:17.870> know<00:02:17.989> kind<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.290> sweaty<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.890> stinky<00:02:19.220> and

you're not going to be growing all this
breed<00:02:26.389> and<00:02:26.540> all<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.750> bacteria<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:28.130> going

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
breed and all this bacteria that's going

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.819 
breed and all this bacteria that's going
to<00:02:28.400> smell<00:02:28.579> bad<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.389> that's<00:02:29.569> pretty<00:02:29.810> cool<00:02:30.079> but

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
to smell bad so that's pretty cool but

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.289 
to smell bad so that's pretty cool but
also<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.609> know<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.790> going<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.940> keep<00:02:32.120> your

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
also you know it's going to keep your

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.420 
also you know it's going to keep your
feet<00:02:32.540> or<00:02:32.959> your<00:02:33.260> legs<00:02:33.530> lower<00:02:33.859> legs<00:02:34.099> nice<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
feet or your legs lower legs nice and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.830 
feet or your legs lower legs nice and
nice<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.480> dry<00:02:35.799> not<00:02:36.799> too<00:02:36.980> hot<00:02:37.190> not<00:02:37.430> too<00:02:37.760> cool<00:02:38.060> so

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
nice and dry not too hot not too cool so

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.479 
nice and dry not too hot not too cool so
a<00:02:38.870> good<00:02:39.139> balance<00:02:39.620> there<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:40.160> all<00:02:40.250> about

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
a good balance there it's all about

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.349 
a good balance there it's all about
achieving<00:02:40.639> a<00:02:41.239> homeostasis<00:02:42.170> with<00:02:42.799> your<00:02:42.980> body

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
achieving a homeostasis with your body

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.059 
achieving a homeostasis with your body
then<00:02:44.359> of<00:02:44.480> course<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.840> other<00:02:44.870> product<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.680> I

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
then of course the other product that I

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.979 
then of course the other product that I
want<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.370> show<00:02:46.549> off<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.030> use<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:47.329> see<00:02:47.840> me
