about<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:26.150> comes<00:03:26.450> with<00:03:26.750> eight<00:03:27.220> size

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
about it it comes with eight size

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.530 
about it it comes with eight size
batteries<00:03:28.850> as<00:03:29.120> well<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:30.500> your<00:03:30.650> radio<00:03:31.540> but

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
batteries as well for your radio but

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.449 
batteries as well for your radio but
that's<00:03:32.810> pretty<00:03:33.170> much<00:03:33.410> everything<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.220> you

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
that's pretty much everything that you

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.430 
that's pretty much everything that you
actually<00:03:34.820> need<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.630> order<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.959> fly<00:03:36.380> this

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
actually need in order to fly this

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.479

helicopter<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:38.300> is<00:03:38.480> why<00:03:38.720> on<00:03:39.620> box<00:03:40.160> in

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
helicopter and that is why on box in

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:49.590 
helicopter and that is why on box in
says<00:03:42.880> hundred<00:03:43.880> percent<00:03:44.300> ready<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.110> fly<00:03:46.840> well

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
says on the box the function of this

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.820 
says on the box the function of this
helicopter<00:04:06.460> is<00:04:06.670> very<00:04:07.090> simple<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.750> like<00:04:08.710> the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
helicopter is very simple I like the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.000 
helicopter is very simple I like the

the<00:04:19.030> cone<00:04:19.209> okay<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:21.100> pull<00:04:21.340> from<00:04:21.520> here<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
the cone okay just pull from here the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.490 
the cone okay just pull from here the
motor<00:04:24.460> sits<00:04:24.850> right<00:04:25.180> here<00:04:25.240> powering<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.290> the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
motor sits right here powering of the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.660 
motor sits right here powering of the

this<00:05:16.210> one<00:05:16.420> is<00:05:16.690> your<00:05:16.900> gyro<00:05:17.290> game<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:18.220> can

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
this one is your gyro game you can

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.580 
this one is your gyro game you can
increase<00:05:18.820> or<00:05:19.000> decrease<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.450> gyro<00:05:19.840> game<00:05:20.080> why

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
increase or decrease the gyro game why

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.990 
increase or decrease the gyro game why
do<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.860> have<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.130> increase<00:05:21.400> or<00:05:21.550> decrease<00:05:21.670> the
