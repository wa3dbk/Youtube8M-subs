by<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> LED<00:00:15.389> technology<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.260> why<00:00:16.410> they

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
by the LED technology so that's why they

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.870 
by the LED technology so that's why they
can<00:00:16.650> kind<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.890> include<00:00:17.130> both<00:00:17.310> things<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.730> there

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
3/4 of an inch thin so it's not gonna

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
3/4 of an inch thin so it's not gonna
take<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.409> space<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.520> on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
take up much space at all now we look on

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.950 
take up much space at all now we look on
the<00:01:26.700> bottom<00:01:26.970> right-hand<00:01:27.210> side<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.840> the

input volume channel menu and power

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.170

true<00:01:33.540> surround<00:01:33.930> speakers<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.530> sound<00:01:34.799> ok

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
true surround speakers they sound ok

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.370 
true surround speakers they sound ok
it's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:35.700> thin<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.869> produce<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it's a little bit thin they do produce a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's a little bit thin they do produce a
reasonable<00:01:37.860> volume<00:01:38.159> they<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> job

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
reasonable volume they will do the job

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
reasonable volume they will do the job
but<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.270> sound<00:01:39.509> matters<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.200> look<00:01:40.350> into

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but if sound matters I would look into

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
but if sound matters I would look into
getting<00:01:40.680> some<00:01:40.829> external<00:01:41.400> speakers<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
getting some external speakers the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.230 
getting some external speakers the
screen<00:01:42.750> resolution<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.619> vizio<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.240> 1366

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
screen resolution on this vizio is 1366

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.670 
screen resolution on this vizio is 1366
by<00:01:45.329> 768<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.710> 480<00:01:47.100> i<00:01:47.189> 480p<00:01:48.079> 720p<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
by 768 you can do 480 i 480p 720p and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.340 
by 768 you can do 480 i 480p 720p and
1080i<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> believe<00:01:50.850> 720p<00:01:51.630> looks<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> best

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
1080i but I believe 720p looks the best

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.649 
1080i but I believe 720p looks the best
on<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.740> TV<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> quick<00:01:54.180> note<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
on this TV now as a quick note the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
on this TV now as a quick note the
flickering<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> camera<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
flickering is from the camera so the the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.100 
flickering is from the camera so the the
video<00:01:56.880> doesn't<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> TV<00:01:57.630> justice

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
