00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
morning after went down I think that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.270 
morning after went down I think that
there<00:03:42.989> was<00:03:43.080> going<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.320> be<00:03:43.380> some<00:03:43.650> strict<00:03:44.070> tough

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
there was going to be some strict tough

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.170 
there was going to be some strict tough
guidelines<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.550> needed<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.540> be<00:03:48.630> met

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
guidelines that needed to be met

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.209 
guidelines that needed to be met
to<00:03:50.870> be<00:03:50.989> honest<00:03:51.260> with<00:03:51.409> you<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.560> was<00:03:51.590> initially

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
to be honest with you I was initially

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:58.300 
to be honest with you I was initially
against<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:55.719> but<00:03:56.719> because<00:03:57.620> we're<00:03:58.159> at

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
against it and but because we're at

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.839 
against it and but because we're at
Gonzaga<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.060> we<00:03:59.209> work<00:04:00.200> at<00:04:00.349> Gonzaga<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:01.730> know

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
Gonzaga and we work at Gonzaga you know

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.240 
Gonzaga and we work at Gonzaga you know
I<00:04:01.879> think<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.719> has<00:04:02.930> been<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.739> real<00:04:04.010> real

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
I think this has been a real real

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.429 
I think this has been a real real
positive<00:04:04.849> step<00:04:05.120> for<00:04:05.420> me<00:04:05.569> too<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.140> think<00:04:06.349> the

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
positive step for me too I think the

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.660 
positive step for me too I think the
easiest<00:04:06.530> thing<00:04:06.889> would<00:04:06.920> have<00:04:07.129> been<00:04:07.250> just<00:04:07.310> to

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
easiest thing would have been just to

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.199 
easiest thing would have been just to
cut<00:04:07.969> these<00:04:08.090> guys<00:04:08.359> loose<00:04:08.829> but<00:04:09.829> it's<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:11.060> been

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
cut these guys loose but it's it's been

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.520 
cut these guys loose but it's it's been
a<00:04:11.239> long<00:04:11.480> haul<00:04:11.750> forum<00:04:12.349> I<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:13.040> they<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
a long haul forum I think they the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.159 
a long haul forum I think they the
program<00:04:15.980> shown<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.940> can<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.509> will<00:04:17.660> move<00:04:17.959> on

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
program shown it it can and will move on
