00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hi to all and steve i hope you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.570
 go well and that your training 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.029
 advanced 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.830
 so today we are out 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.110
 agglomeration on a small road 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 countryside a little narrow where we will see 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.230
 just a few difficult crossings 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.929
 with other vehicles and we will see 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 also pedestrian overpass which 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.630
 is bikes here is a good learning 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.360
 go I'm on a road outside agglo 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.230
 the jelly turn right 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.030
 so I checked I pass my third 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.440
 my second I check my angle 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.090
 dead and I turn so I have no 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.620
 visibility on this little road that 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.520
 I approach so I put everything gently I 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 always give thanks with this bar 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.090
 there I am in second I will spend my 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.720
 third since I have a little more 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.670
 visibility 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.320
 I'm not going very fast it's not because 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.590
 that it's limited to 80 for young people 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.440
 drivers that I roll to 80 the hat on 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.879
 okay 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.920
 I do not see it very well I'm ready to 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.510
 to brake in case ok the shoah a 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.220
 car I brake and I retrograde from the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.020
 second and how great and 3 I 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.310
 will hang around again and when that's shaking 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.140
 I read them it's my first I'll 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.430
 stop altogether to let the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.740
 car was going on that level since 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.990
 it's a little more the street and I'm leaving 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.430
 check well and I restart I see 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.110
 people on the side I spend my 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.140
 second game internal controls 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.369
 outdoor blind spot flashing i 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.049
 away from far I do not tend the last 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.140
 word, I deviate well I savor it 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.700
 still wise of nothing here I'm checking 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.380
 many people that I passed and there I 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.509
 pass my third 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.719
 here I can go a little bit 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.719
 faster 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.000
 so what do I see if I 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.380
 look where she had already played in nice 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.940
 and a mirror up there so if there is a 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.080
 General intersection draws some 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.240
 because there is no visibility 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.010
 I see that it is I who have priority 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.150
 joy markings of stocks that I 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.830
 recognize the panel two pieces of 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.950
 fingers profile also I want funny 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.950
 say 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.619
 so suddenly there we are talking huh I 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.030
 not too much looking on the right has 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.899
 usually I always look on 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.100
 the right before crossing 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.990
 the intersection even when I have the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.130
 priority it was a big victory that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.409
 said I may have maybe you 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.660
 already said that the cemetery etienne people 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.970
 who had priority it did not happen 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.530
 very cheerful but it's so much to do 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.480
 super attention even when we have the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 priority 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.299
 ok so here I have no visibility I 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.260
 slow down a little bit I'm still 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.360
 in third 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.299
 all is well I'm ready to brake if 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.819
 someone arrives at and there I take advantage he 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.190
 there is nobody I see no intersections 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.970
 I will spend my fourth as soon as 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.549
 I arrive at about 60 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.950
 kilometers / hour the fourth is good 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.629
 deep down there I see a sign that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 announce me an intersection where I will have the 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.400
 priority to 150 meters from the panel so at 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.129
 from the panel I will start already 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.090
 release the accelerator 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.560
 that's where I think I know cowardly 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.030
 accelerator I look a little behind 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.890
 I start to brake a bit like you 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.510
 I will not stay a fourth game but 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.890
 it's not even my third 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.200
 if I have priority as I told you 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.330
 you never know so I 'm careful 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.940
 ok here I do not see it too much I have a 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.560
 stack above the law here it's the same 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.030
 I do not see too much so I have the foot 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.690
 brother's top that's there I can 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.120
 speed up a little bit 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.890
 I accelerate I am at 60 I pass the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.790
 fourth game - balloon that tells me a 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 priority right 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.900
 from the panel there I already start 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.070
 to brake I pass the third I 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.080
 always the brake the brake stays 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.670
 constant I spend the second 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.110
 when I arrive at about 40 km 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.790
 and a small mirror but I do not see 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.560
 too much where I continue to brake I see 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.140
 nothing when it's shaking I put my 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 first ok there's nobody I'm leaving 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.590
 check well behind when I'm leaving 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.030
 people who double me because 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.710
 sometimes when we slow down the gardens 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.820
 take advantage for us forget I do not ask 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.810
 the question of whether there is 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.330
 someone who arrives right and year 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.220
 so see there I handed my third 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.440
 by rote 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 ok that's a way there frost not too much 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.560
 young and brake there really is no 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.170
 visibility is pretty narrow I pass 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.610
 in second I take no risks ok 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.780
 the magic of kanem city ​​to children 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.780
 I repeat my third 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.819
 a little bit so I see two cyclists who 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.120
 are better for internships than not at 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.459
 double 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.300
 so I'll have a behind so I'll you 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.680
 do not say it all the time but the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.940
 frequency of gaze towards the back is 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.530
 about every five seconds I 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.780
 eyes all the time behind what there 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.269
 I go back to this goal I'm pretty much 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 40 30 km time I stay behind you 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.829
 have seen I keep a good distance from 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.859
 security 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 I do not stick them I can prepare my 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.100
 flashing since we give him the doubled 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.570
 but I have not and we and right now 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.700
 because at an intersection here I know 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.900
 not who it is that has priority then 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.600
 now I see they would have stop 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.250
 to life that the rival case deal so I 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.250
 do not double it stays behind always 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.310
 ok I still can not forget it then 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.990
 that they waited for me to double but there 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.669
 there is no visibility face I have 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.380
 four halls of risk 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.030
 I'm waiting to see I'm staying behind 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.440
 last safe list I have of 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.060
 well behind there is a car in front 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.560
 I like doing double step sometimes 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.590
 you mixes well see it so I 'm going 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.720
 go there a downpour is ok go this is 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.120
 I leave well bushy I leave them 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.010
 do not stick now here I keep them 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.510
 would have too much there I see them I the 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.880
 see so it's good I lift my 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.880
 always blinking at the bottom right 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.410
 I spend my 4th 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.320
 there I have not much visibility I redo 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.640
 reindeer I come back third you have 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.960
 but it's not because I spent the 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.030
 fourth that I will necessarily stay 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.480
 long fourth I can all of 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.790
 after ironing the third ajax and 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.370
 I do not see enough for me 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.660
 launch 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.340
 ok here I see it a little better I accelerate 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.770
 a flea I accelerate the engine 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.460
 begins to force me the surroundings of 60 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.900
 I pass the fourth for recall and the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.070
 speeds you can pass them all 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.080
 20 km ok the second one can the 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.100
 move on to do you understand you 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.420
 look at my course actually 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.160
 look at my class if you are not 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.810
 better on the gearbox where I 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.580
 explain all that in detail like that 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.150
 I'm telling you not now I 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.770
 will be a link here in the video 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.490
 so here I am a fourth and I'm going 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.800
 not go faster 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.020
 same as it's limited to 90 80 for you 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.120
 young drivers game I'm going rather 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.590
 adapted according to the configuration 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.440
 places c3 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.780
 there are out of houses do not need 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.160
 play with fire here I have priority to 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.450
 the next intersection but I'm going 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.030
 still when I told you to let go 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.950
 the accelerator let a little die the 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.960
 lure and I will not stay in fourth 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.110
 I will spend my third entry in 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.720
 a little bit here you never know 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.440
 prevention is better than cure here 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.210
 I come back to the agglomeration which is 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.810
 managed adopted at 50 km time I'm already 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.030
 a third 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.080
 ok vehicle ariane sas jeffrey hesitates 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.760
 not braked a little bit harder and at 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.100
 put my second to cross 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.430
 in conditions of safety 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.960
 sufficient and I go back to the third 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.610
 So here we are going to finish is as for 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.320
 him to comment here I'm going to stop 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.610
 along the edge of the road so I 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.370
 check well in my two retro 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.230
 the dead angle useless to the monster call 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.990
 who will come out of the ditch that has no 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.370
 place so I put my flashing all 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.470
