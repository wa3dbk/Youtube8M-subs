version of it I'm not so sure what you
guys<00:00:22.080> are<00:00:22.140> gonna<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.010> it's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
guys are gonna think of this one it's

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
guys are gonna think of this one it's
one<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.199> little<00:00:25.199> odd<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.800> me<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.160> not

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
one that is a little odd to me I'm not

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
one that is a little odd to me I'm not
sure<00:00:26.369> what<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.630> think<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
sure what I think of it but I think it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200 
sure what I think of it but I think it
is<00:00:27.990> still<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> cool<00:00:28.590> design<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.730> before<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.090> get

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is still a cool design so before we get

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.339 
is still a cool design so before we get
started<00:00:30.269> let<00:00:30.660> me<00:00:30.689> give<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.230> few

started let me give you just a few
background<00:00:31.710> details<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.730> map<00:00:32.969> first

background details about this map first
off<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.600> built<00:00:33.809> by<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.320> guy<00:00:34.620> he<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.040> no

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
off it's built by one guy he had no

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
off it's built by one guy he had no
friends<00:00:35.610> help<00:00:35.790> him<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.719> took<00:00:36.870> him<00:00:37.050> about

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
friends help him and it took him about

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.910 
friends help him and it took him about
six<00:00:37.770> months<00:00:38.550> he<00:00:38.850> built<00:00:39.290> 97%<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> before

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
six months he built 97% of it before

six months he built 97% of it before
creative<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.180> explains<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
creative which kind of explains the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
creative which kind of explains the
little<00:00:43.140> weird<00:00:43.530> glass<00:00:43.920> things<00:00:44.280> we're<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
little weird glass things we're going to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180 
little weird glass things we're going to
see<00:00:44.789> around<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.360> map<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:46.920> gonna<00:00:47.010> get

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
see around this map and I'm gonna get

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
see around this map and I'm gonna get
into<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.300> later<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
into that a little bit more later when I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.290 
into that a little bit more later when I
start<00:00:49.230> talking<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> pros<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:49.890> cons

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
start talking about the pros and cons

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.930 
start talking about the pros and cons
but<00:00:51.300> he<00:00:51.989> based<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.469> map<00:00:52.710> off<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.340> PC<00:00:53.730> map

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but he based this map off of a PC map

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
but he based this map off of a PC map
however<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> converted<00:00:55.920> PC<00:00:56.370> map<00:00:56.550> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
however it is not a converted PC map so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
however it is not a converted PC map so
if<00:00:56.879> you're<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.120> into<00:00:57.360> those<00:00:57.480> converted<00:00:57.989> Maps

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
if you're not into those converted Maps

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.709 
if you're not into those converted Maps
then<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> those<00:00:59.789> he<00:01:00.570> did

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
then this is not one of those he did

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
then this is not one of those he did
base<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.140> off<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> his

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
base it off of it but it has some of his

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.020 
base it off of it but it has some of his
own<00:01:02.699> stuff<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.260> let's<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.280> started<00:01:05.820> as

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
own stuff in it so let's get started as

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
own stuff in it so let's get started as
you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.540> taking<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> tour<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you can see just taking a tour of the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
you can see just taking a tour of the
outside<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.640> has<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.330> cool<00:01:09.630> design

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
outside here it has a really cool design

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
outside here it has a really cool design
and<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.860> interesting<00:01:11.369> how<00:01:11.490> it's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and it's very interesting how it's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670 
and it's very interesting how it's
docked<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.299> area<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.439> come<00:01:13.650> over

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
docked in this area here if we come over

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.460 
docked in this area here if we come over
here<00:01:13.920> basically<00:01:14.850> you'll<00:01:15.060> start<00:01:15.360> winning<00:01:15.900> way

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
here basically you'll start winning way

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
here basically you'll start winning way
away<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.070> you're<00:01:18.000> walking<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.390> house<00:01:18.600> which

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
away and you're walking a house which

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.390 
away and you're walking a house which
gives<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> few<00:01:19.470> instructions<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> things

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
I just told you about the map but you'll

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
I just told you about the map but you'll
come<00:01:26.340> into<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.409> a

come into here which is kind of like a
you<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.159> docking<00:01:29.790> station<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you know docking station it's just

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
you know docking station it's just
really<00:01:30.990> cool<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.520> awesome

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
really cool I mean I think it's awesome

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
really cool I mean I think it's awesome
to<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> way

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to have this here and then just the way

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.210 
to have this here and then just the way
as<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.810> whole<00:01:37.079> docks<00:01:37.770> how

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
as you can see the whole docks how

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
as you can see the whole docks how
there's<00:01:38.430> several<00:01:38.610> different<00:01:38.939> ways<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
there's several different ways to get in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.850 
there's several different ways to get in
through<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> ship<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.590> that's<00:01:40.740> just

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
through the ship I think that's just

really<00:01:40.979> cool<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.729> awesome<00:01:42.270> design<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.810> like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
really cool really awesome design I like

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.719 
really cool really awesome design I like
that<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.710> too<00:01:43.860> long<00:01:43.979> ago<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.310> did<00:01:44.460> review

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that now not too long ago we did review

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
that now not too long ago we did review
a<00:01:44.939> ship<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> plane<00:01:45.899> cruise<00:01:46.229> ship

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
a ship it was just a plane cruise ship

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.639 
a ship it was just a plane cruise ship
wasn't<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.220> Titanic<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.560> has

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
wasn't a Titanic and so this one has

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.260 
wasn't a Titanic and so this one has
except<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.790> love<00:01:51.090> these

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
except for this one is I love these

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.990 
except for this one is I love these
history<00:01:51.659> type<00:01:51.899> maps<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.939> one

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
history type maps like this but this one

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060 
history type maps like this but this one
it's<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.170> interesting<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:55.979> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it's it's it's just interesting as you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's it's it's just interesting as you
can<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> design<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> ship<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
can see the design of the ship there's a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
can see the design of the ship there's a
lot<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> glass<00:01:58.560> surrounded<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.460> pretty<00:01:59.790> sure

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
lot of glass surrounded I'm pretty sure

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
lot of glass surrounded I'm pretty sure
this<00:02:00.119> stuff<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> top<00:02:00.930> was<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.439> just

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
this stuff on the top was you know just

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.499 
this stuff on the top was you know just
to<00:02:01.740> help<00:02:01.860> him<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> build<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> whatnot

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to help him kind of build it and whatnot

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.450 
to help him kind of build it and whatnot
because<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.290> said<00:02:04.500> 97<00:02:05.100> percent<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
because it's like I said 97 percent of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370 
because it's like I said 97 percent of
it<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.610> done<00:02:05.790> before<00:02:06.000> creative<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.079> still

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
it was done before creative but still

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.139 
it was done before creative but still
before<00:02:07.530> he<00:02:07.860> published<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> map<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> everyone

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
before he published the map to everyone

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
before he published the map to everyone
he<00:02:09.539> should<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.780> gotten<00:02:09.989> rid<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
he should have gotten rid of that and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.710 
he should have gotten rid of that and
I'm<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.310> sure<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> see<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> glass

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I'm not sure like you see the glass

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.560 
I'm not sure like you see the glass
off<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.140> towers<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.190> I'm<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.820> exactly<00:02:15.300> sure

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
off the towers here I'm not exactly sure

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.970 
off the towers here I'm not exactly sure
if<00:02:15.810> that's<00:02:16.080> supposed<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.650> his

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
if that's supposed to be like his

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.680 
if that's supposed to be like his
version<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.550> ropes<00:02:17.910> coming<00:02:18.240> off<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
version of like ropes coming off of it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.540 
version of like ropes coming off of it
which<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.410> okay<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.740> mean<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.280> good<00:02:20.400> idea

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
which is okay I mean it's a good idea

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.700 
which is okay I mean it's a good idea
it's<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.030> great<00:02:21.240> way<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.810> especially

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
it's a great way to do it especially

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.740 
it's a great way to do it especially
from<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.160> distance<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:24.060> doesn't<00:02:24.330> look<00:02:24.570> too<00:02:24.720> bad

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
from a distance it doesn't look too bad

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.420 
from a distance it doesn't look too bad
but<00:02:24.930> when<00:02:25.290> you're<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.770> ship<00:02:25.830> itself<00:02:26.250> it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
but when you're on the ship itself it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.010 
but when you're on the ship itself it
just<00:02:26.460> looks<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.880> bunch<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.270> glass<00:02:27.480> blocks

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
just looks like a bunch of glass blocks

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
just looks like a bunch of glass blocks
and<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:28.710> kind<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.010> maybe<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.490> would

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and so it's kind of like maybe you would

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.770 
and so it's kind of like maybe you would
have<00:02:29.640> been<00:02:29.790> better<00:02:29.820> off<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.450> leaving

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
have been better off you know leaving

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.750 
have been better off you know leaving
the<00:02:30.930> rope<00:02:31.230> out<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.250> don't<00:02:32.280> know<00:02:32.580> that's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the rope out of it I don't know that's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.030 
the rope out of it I don't know that's
just<00:02:32.940> me<00:02:33.270> we're<00:02:33.990> gonna<00:02:34.110> take<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.320> quick<00:02:34.560> look

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
just me we're gonna take a quick look

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.800 
just me we're gonna take a quick look
kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.640> through<00:02:35.790> some<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.060> windows<00:02:36.450> here

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
kind of through some of the windows here

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.080 
kind of through some of the windows here
this<00:02:37.230> map<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.680> completely<00:02:38.250> furnished<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this map is completely furnished and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.940 
this map is completely furnished and
you'll<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.440> through<00:02:40.650> some<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you'll see that through some of the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.560 
you'll see that through some of the
windows<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.490> you'll<00:02:41.850> see<00:02:42.030> there's<00:02:42.240> kind<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
windows here you'll see there's kind of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.570 
windows here you'll see there's kind of
like<00:02:42.630> beds<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.500> whatnot<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.490> go

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
like beds and whatnot in there if we go

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.400 
like beds and whatnot in there if we go
down<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:45.000> we'll<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.630> crew's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
down more we'll see kind of like crew's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.199 
down more we'll see kind of like crew's
quarters<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.040> things<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.370> tons<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.910> beds

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
quarters and things with tons of beds

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.870 
quarters and things with tons of beds
one<00:02:49.050> note<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.740> not<00:02:49.920> sleep<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.459> any<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
one note is do not sleep in any of the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.540 
one note is do not sleep in any of the
beds<00:02:51.290> especially<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> top<00:02:52.620> bunks<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.280> will

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
beds especially the top bunks they will

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.970 
beds especially the top bunks they will
kill<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.810> know<00:02:55.020> when<00:02:55.740> we<00:02:55.830> walk

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
kill you just so you know when we walk

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.620 
kill you just so you know when we walk
into<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.370> ship<00:02:56.580> you'll<00:02:56.760> see<00:02:56.910> kind<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.480> this

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
into the ship you'll see kind of this

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.690 
into the ship you'll see kind of this
interesting<00:02:58.200> interior<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.070> don't<00:02:59.430> really

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
interesting interior I don't really

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.780 
interesting interior I don't really
recall<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.780> Titanic<00:03:01.770> being<00:03:01.950> purple<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.640> red

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
recall the Titanic being purple and red

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.910 
recall the Titanic being purple and red
and<00:03:03.000> pink<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.420> mean<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.720> could<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:04.110> wrong<00:03:04.140> it's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and pink I mean I could be wrong it's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440 
and pink I mean I could be wrong it's
not<00:03:05.040> something<00:03:05.370> I've<00:03:05.490> ever<00:03:05.520> really<00:03:05.940> studied

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
not something I've ever really studied

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.630 
not something I've ever really studied
too<00:03:06.600> much<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.230> it's<00:03:08.040> definitely<00:03:08.459> an

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
too much but it's definitely an

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.949 
too much but it's definitely an
interesting<00:03:08.760> color<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.660> see<00:03:09.840> this

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
interesting color you can can I see this

itself<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.670> inn<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.150> know<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.390> interior<00:03:30.840> I

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
itself the inn you know the interior I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.330 
itself the inn you know the interior I
never<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:31.380> paid<00:03:31.530> any<00:03:31.800> attention<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.190> that

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
never really paid any attention to that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.850 
never really paid any attention to that
when<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:32.640> studied<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:34.290> actually<00:03:34.650> took<00:03:34.739> an

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
when we studied it we actually took an

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.470 
when we studied it we actually took an
entire<00:03:35.010> trip<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.580> museum<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.450> I

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
entire trip to a museum just do and I

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.030 
entire trip to a museum just do and I
was<00:03:36.630> fascinated<00:03:36.870> with<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.650> never<00:03:37.830> paid

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
was fascinated with it but I never paid

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.290 
was fascinated with it but I never paid
attention<00:03:38.160> really<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.880> interior<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.269> I

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
attention really to the interior so I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.759 
attention really to the interior so I
could<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.600> wrong<00:03:39.750> good<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.320> have<00:03:40.440> some<00:03:40.620> cool

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
could be wrong good to have some cool

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.770 
could be wrong good to have some cool
colors<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:42.120> could<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.420> pretty

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
colors like this and it could be pretty

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.160 
colors like this and it could be pretty
scale<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:44.010> what<00:03:44.160> we<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:44.430> at<00:03:44.549> least<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.170> I

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
scale to what we know at least and I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.800 
scale to what we know at least and I
could<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.010> be<00:03:47.130> wrong<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.120> me<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.570> just

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
could just be wrong but for me I just

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.080 
could just be wrong but for me I just
can't<00:03:49.019> kind<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.260> take<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> seriously<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.549> what

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
can't kind of take it seriously so what

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.430 
can't kind of take it seriously so what
we're<00:03:51.209> gonna<00:03:51.299> do<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.750> kind<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.019> skip<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440

something to keep it noticed as you tell
I<00:05:38.289> don't<00:05:38.349> know<00:05:38.500> if<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.620> guys<00:05:38.710> can<00:05:38.860> tell<00:05:39.039> in<00:05:39.159> the

I don't know if you guys can tell in the
video<00:05:39.460> or<00:05:39.550> not<00:05:39.699> but<00:05:39.909> right<00:05:40.120> now<00:05:40.300> even<00:05:40.630> a<00:05:40.750> frame

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
video or not but right now even a frame

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.469 
video or not but right now even a frame
rate<00:05:41.169> is<00:05:41.380> pretty<00:05:41.800> low<00:05:42.250> so<00:05:42.550> that's<00:05:43.270> something

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
rate is pretty low so that's something

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.120 
rate is pretty low so that's something
to<00:05:43.630> consider<00:05:43.960> you're<00:05:44.259> not<00:05:44.349> gonna<00:05:44.469> have<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.650> huge

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
to consider you're not gonna have a huge

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.670 
to consider you're not gonna have a huge
frame<00:05:45.550> rate<00:05:45.759> it<00:05:45.909> has<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.449> load<00:05:46.690> if<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:47.469> plan<00:05:47.650> on

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
frame rate it has to load if you plan on

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.990 
frame rate it has to load if you plan on
doing<00:05:47.919> this<00:05:48.009> with<00:05:48.190> friends<00:05:48.460> they<00:05:48.729> can<00:05:48.879> have

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
doing this with friends they can have

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.730 
doing this with friends they can have
issues<00:05:49.270> with<00:05:49.659> loving<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.259> servers<00:05:50.560> just

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
issues with loving and servers just

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.469 
issues with loving and servers just
because<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.099> how<00:05:51.490> massive<00:05:51.819> it<00:05:52.090> is<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.389> how

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
because of how massive it is and how

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.839 
because of how massive it is and how
long<00:05:52.659> it<00:05:52.900> takes<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.349> load<00:05:53.620> so<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.669> is

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
long it takes to load so that is

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.959 
long it takes to load so that is
definitely<00:05:55.360> something<00:05:55.629> to<00:05:55.900> consider<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.940> you

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
definitely something to consider and you

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.730 
definitely something to consider and you
know<00:05:58.479> even<00:05:58.750> after<00:05:58.840> waiting<00:05:59.080> five<00:05:59.289> minutes<00:05:59.590> the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
know even after waiting five minutes the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.649 
know even after waiting five minutes the
lag<00:05:59.949> really<00:06:00.520> never<00:06:00.789> goes<00:06:01.060> away<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:01.539> still

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
lag really never goes away it's still

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.689 
lag really never goes away it's still
there<00:06:02.020> no<00:06:02.560> matter<00:06:02.740> what<00:06:03.039> so<00:06:03.219> that's<00:06:03.279> something

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
there no matter what so that's something

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.029 
there no matter what so that's something
to<00:06:03.909> really<00:06:04.029> think<00:06:04.330> about<00:06:04.389> and<00:06:04.810> then<00:06:05.319> the<00:06:05.889> only

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
to really think about and then the only

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.580 
to really think about and then the only
other<00:06:06.129> real<00:06:06.490> con<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.389> had<00:06:07.840> to<00:06:08.080> it<00:06:08.229> was<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.440> fact

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
other real con I had to it was the fact

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.649 
other real con I had to it was the fact
that<00:06:08.680> this<00:06:08.889> class<00:06:09.279> I<00:06:09.580> just<00:06:09.789> I<00:06:09.940> can't<00:06:10.360> take<00:06:10.539> it

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
that this class I just I can't take it

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.480 
that this class I just I can't take it
seriously<00:06:11.050> I<00:06:11.169> mean<00:06:11.289> it's<00:06:11.740> definitely<00:06:11.949> cool

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
seriously I mean it's definitely cool

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.980 
seriously I mean it's definitely cool
it's<00:06:12.669> a<00:06:12.699> good<00:06:12.819> idea<00:06:12.909> for<00:06:13.180> like<00:06:13.330> rope<00:06:13.569> and<00:06:13.779> stuff

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
it's a good idea for like rope and stuff

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.930 
it's a good idea for like rope and stuff
but<00:06:14.590> especially<00:06:14.770> this<00:06:15.159> class<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.729> kind<00:06:15.909> of

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
but especially this class just kind of

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.550 
but especially this class just kind of
scales<00:06:16.389> across<00:06:16.659> the<00:06:16.900> top<00:06:17.139> here<00:06:17.169> I'm<00:06:17.409> not

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
scales across the top here I'm not

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.200 
scales across the top here I'm not
exactly<00:06:17.860> sure<00:06:18.039> like<00:06:18.669> I<00:06:18.729> said<00:06:18.879> I<00:06:18.909> think<00:06:19.000> is

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
exactly sure like I said I think is

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.730 
exactly sure like I said I think is
probably<00:06:19.629> believed<00:06:19.870> for<00:06:20.020> him<00:06:20.169> to<00:06:20.289> work<00:06:20.440> on<00:06:20.620> it

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
probably believed for him to work on it

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.279 
probably believed for him to work on it
but<00:06:21.039> before<00:06:21.430> you<00:06:21.520> publish<00:06:21.729> a<00:06:21.879> map<00:06:22.150> like<00:06:23.020> this

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
but before you publish a map like this

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.779 
but before you publish a map like this
that<00:06:23.650> people<00:06:23.889> are<00:06:23.949> going<00:06:24.039> to<00:06:24.129> be<00:06:24.340> interested

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
that people are going to be interested

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.040 
that people are going to be interested
in<00:06:24.879> downloading<00:06:25.029> you<00:06:25.419> should<00:06:25.599> definitely

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
in downloading you should definitely

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.620 
in downloading you should definitely
remove

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
remove

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.940

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
things like that things that have helped

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.830 
things like that things that have helped
you<00:06:28.070> build<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:28.610> just<00:06:28.760> because<00:06:29.450> it<00:06:29.570> just<00:06:29.690> makes

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
you build it just because it just makes

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.020 
you build it just because it just makes
it<00:06:29.930> so<00:06:30.080> much<00:06:30.140> cooler<00:06:30.530> so<00:06:31.030> definitely

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
it so much cooler so definitely
