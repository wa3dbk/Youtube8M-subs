00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.759 
they do need to expand some their colors
though<00:02:45.920> cuz<00:02:46.920> after<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.519> shade<00:02:48.019> which<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.230> am<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
though cuz after this shade which I am I

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.770 
though cuz after this shade which I am I
think<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.129> was<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.790> other<00:02:51.060> darker<00:02:51.569> shade

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
think it was like one other darker shade

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.009 
think it was like one other darker shade
and<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:52.709> 355<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.870> they

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
and I think that's 355 so they

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.140 
and I think that's 355 so they
definitely<00:02:55.170> need<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.739> expand<00:02:56.220> their<00:02:56.489> colors

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
