going to show us the sapphire mini pc
doesn't<00:00:21.600> actually<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> model<00:00:22.199> number<00:00:22.230> yet

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
doesn't actually have a model number yet

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.840 
doesn't actually have a model number yet
but<00:00:22.769> i'm<00:00:22.890> told<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.460> may<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.699> some

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
but i'm told that it may have some

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.910 
but i'm told that it may have some
numbers<00:00:24.210> after<00:00:24.420> when<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:24.960> launched<00:00:25.380> so

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
numbers after when it's launched so

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.849 
numbers after when it's launched so
let's<00:00:26.310> let's<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.510> now<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> let<00:00:28.260> builder

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
let's let's go in now and let builder

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
let's let's go in now and let builder
and<00:00:29.070> tell<00:00:29.340> us<00:00:29.429> about<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> system<00:00:30.140> alright

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and tell us about the system alright

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
and tell us about the system alright
though<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.160> stuff<00:00:32.430> i<00:00:32.579> mean<00:00:32.790> III<00:00:32.880> see

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
though I'm the stuff i mean III see

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.510 
though I'm the stuff i mean III see
what's<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:33.719> okay<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.770> obviously<00:00:35.160> we

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
what's it all about okay so obviously we

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.850 
what's it all about okay so obviously we
talked<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:36.000> fusion<00:00:36.450> earlier<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.710> way

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
talked about fusion earlier and the way

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.990 
talked about fusion earlier and the way
that<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> allow<00:00:38.489> us<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> build

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that that's going to allow us to build

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.090 
that that's going to allow us to build
more<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.480> integrated<00:00:40.020> products<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
more and more integrated products so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.410 
more and more integrated products so
what<00:00:41.280> we're<00:00:41.430> introducing<00:00:41.940> here<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
what we're introducing here is the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.470 
what we're introducing here is the
concept<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:44.010> small<00:00:44.160> format<00:00:44.879> PC<00:00:45.270> this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
concept for a very small format PC this

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
concept for a very small format PC this
is<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> smallest<00:00:46.020> format<00:00:46.469> pc<00:00:46.860> available<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is a smallest format pc available it's

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
is a smallest format pc available it's
less<00:00:48.090> than<00:00:48.300> half<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> liter<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.829> particular

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
less than half a liter this particular

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.580 
less than half a liter this particular
model<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.879> based<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.300> ion<00:00:51.629> technology<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
model is based on ion technology but the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.290 
model is based on ion technology but the
plan<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> build<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> similar<00:00:53.969> product

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
plan will be to build a similar product

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
plan will be to build a similar product
based<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.690> fusion<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.350> end<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
based on fusion to end up with the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.520 
based on fusion to end up with the
product<00:00:56.520> line<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> lifestyle

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
product line like this it's a lifestyle

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
product line like this it's a lifestyle
product<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.250> fit<00:00:59.520> into<00:00:59.670> any<00:00:59.879> home

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
product it will fit into any home

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.420 
product it will fit into any home
environment<00:01:00.690> take<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.050> no<00:01:01.260> space<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:02.160> give<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the fusion based model of this when do

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
the fusion based model of this when do
you<00:01:14.400> expect<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> may<00:01:15.180> come<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you expect that it may come to the

sample you've got you can use one over

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.240 
sample you've got you can use one over
the<00:01:39.509> specs<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.020> quickly<00:01:40.439> yeah<00:01:40.950> this

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the specs so quickly yeah this

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
the specs so quickly yeah this
introductory<00:01:41.759> modern<00:01:42.180> loose<00:01:42.390> you'd<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
introductory modern loose you'd be

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
introductory modern loose you'd be
surprised<00:01:43.290> actually<00:01:43.560> we've<00:01:44.009> got<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.310> eye<00:01:44.430> on

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
surprised actually we've got an eye on

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.940
