00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
going to say that the waist measurement
was<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.460> 24<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.890> divided<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.039> four<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.940> comes

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
was at 24 and divided by four that comes

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
was at 24 and divided by four that comes
out<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.390> six<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> place<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:01.920> ruler

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
out to six I'm going to place my ruler

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.539 
out to six I'm going to place my ruler
on<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.809> fold<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> tissue<00:01:04.830> paper<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
on the fold of the tissue paper at the
six<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> make<00:01:07.409> some<00:01:07.680> marks

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
six and I'm going to make some marks

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.630 
six and I'm going to make some marks
here<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.110> draw<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> line<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> next

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here and draw a line the next

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.550 
here and draw a line the next
measurement<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.960> will<00:01:13.530> be

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
measurement I'm going to use will be

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
measurement I'm going to use will be
from<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> waist<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> hip<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> outer

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
from the waist to the hip on the outer

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
from the waist to the hip on the outer
curve<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.100> number<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> came<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.450> was

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
curve the number that I came up with was

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010 
curve the number that I came up with was
nine<00:01:19.200> inches<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.180> coming<00:01:21.450> down<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
nine inches so I'm coming down to the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
nine inches so I'm coming down to the
nine<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.740> making<00:01:23.100> some<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.610> marks

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
nine and I'm making some little marks

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
nine and I'm making some little marks
and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.119> using<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:28.049> measurement

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and then I will be using the measurement

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340 
and then I will be using the measurement
for<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> hip<00:01:29.549> line<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.540> hip<00:01:30.720> line<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
for the hip line the hip line that I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.270 
for the hip line the hip line that I
have<00:01:31.850> was<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.180> 32<00:01:34.020> inches<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:34.829> dividing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
have was at 32 inches we're dividing

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
have was at 32 inches we're dividing
that<00:01:35.430> by<00:01:35.490> four<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:37.229> coming<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.650> with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that by four and we're coming up with

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.330 
that by four and we're coming up with
eight<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.150> putting<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> eight<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:41.159> here

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
eight and putting that eight right here

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
eight and putting that eight right here
on<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> fold<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> tissue<00:01:42.270> paper<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.960> I'm

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
on the fold of the tissue paper and I'm

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
on the fold of the tissue paper and I'm
drawing<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.280> straight<00:01:44.340> line<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:44.850> where<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
drawing a straight line right where we

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.319 
drawing a straight line right where we
made<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:45.899> marks<00:01:46.560> before<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
made those little marks before from the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.800 
made those little marks before from the
hip<00:01:48.479> line<00:01:49.280> okay<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.909> next<00:01:51.210> thing<00:01:51.360> we're<00:01:51.630> going

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
hip line okay the next thing we're going
