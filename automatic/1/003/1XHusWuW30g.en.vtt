small and incredibly powerful little

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.540 
small and incredibly powerful little
camcorder<00:00:42.840> I'll<00:00:43.200> show<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> why<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
camcorder I'll show you why it's got a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
camcorder I'll show you why it's got a
three<00:00:44.730> CCD<00:00:45.690> sensor<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:46.469> that's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
three CCD sensor on it now that's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
three CCD sensor on it now that's
something<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.039> usually<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.690> pro

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
something you usually see on more pro

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
something you usually see on more pro
level<00:00:49.410> cameras<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:49.920> prosumer<00:00:50.460> level<00:00:50.489> cameras

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
level cameras or prosumer level cameras

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
level cameras or prosumer level cameras
so<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> perform<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.949> well

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so it's going to perform very very well

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.650 
so it's going to perform very very well
in<00:00:53.399> lower<00:00:53.610> light<00:00:53.879> situations<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.570> gonna

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in lower light situations you're gonna

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
in lower light situations you're gonna
get<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:55.230> better<00:00:55.500> color<00:00:55.890> detail<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:57.239> records

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
get much better color detail it records

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.709 
get much better color detail it records
in<00:00:57.780> 1920<00:00:58.469> by<00:00:58.590> 1080<00:00:59.160> P<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.059> has<00:01:00.180> built-in

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
in 1920 by 1080 P it has built-in

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
in 1920 by 1080 P it has built-in
optical<00:01:01.170> image<00:01:01.920> stabilization<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.180> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
optical image stabilization so if you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.840 
optical image stabilization so if you
got<00:01:03.390> shaky<00:01:03.750> hands<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.430> least<00:01:05.580> help

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
got shaky hands this will at least help

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
got shaky hands this will at least help
take<00:01:06.180> care<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
take care of that a little bit and it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
take care of that a little bit and it
also<00:01:08.159> has<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.700> extraordinarily<00:01:09.180> high<00:01:09.630> quality

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
also has an extraordinarily high quality

one<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> other<00:01:20.520> standout<00:01:20.909> features<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> this

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
one the other standout features of this

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
one the other standout features of this
thing<00:01:21.689> take<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> look<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.470> top<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.210> that's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
thing take a look at the top here that's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
thing take a look at the top here that's
actually<00:01:24.330> five<00:01:24.979> microphones<00:01:25.979> five<00:01:26.280> discreet

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
actually five microphones five discreet

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
actually five microphones five discreet
microphones<00:01:27.270> built<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> camcorder

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
microphones built in to this camcorder

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.590
