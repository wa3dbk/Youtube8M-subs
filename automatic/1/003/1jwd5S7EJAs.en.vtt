uses a bobby pin I'll show you exactly

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.109 
uses a bobby pin I'll show you exactly
how<00:01:05.330> i<00:01:06.470> made<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.680> technique<00:01:08.640> because

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
how i made this technique because

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.560 
how i made this technique because
whenever<00:01:09.330> i'm<00:01:09.630> cabling<00:01:10.200> i<00:01:10.409> always<00:01:11.010> lose<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
whenever i'm cabling i always lose the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.190 
whenever i'm cabling i always lose the
loop<00:01:13.700> either<00:01:14.700> by<00:01:14.909> stretching<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.689> tight<00:01:16.020> or

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
loop either by stretching it tight or

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
loop either by stretching it tight or
something<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.070> always<00:01:17.369> lose<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
something like that I always lose the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.190 
something like that I always lose the
loop<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> sometimes<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> do<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
loop and sometimes I have to do the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
loop and sometimes I have to do the
previous<00:01:19.590> row<00:01:19.799> over<00:01:20.100> again<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.610> really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
previous row over again and it's really

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.690 
previous row over again and it's really
annoying<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> made<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
annoying so I kind of made this way to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
annoying so I kind of made this way to
counteract<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.960> basically<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.530> loops

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
counteract that basically the loops

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.140 
counteract that basically the loops
never<00:01:26.460> leave<00:01:27.060> leave<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:29.100> hook<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.820> bobby

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
never leave leave the hook or the bobby

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
never leave leave the hook or the bobby
pin<00:01:30.420> they're<00:01:30.630> always<00:01:30.810> attached<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> something

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pin they're always attached to something

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.609 
pin they're always attached to something
so<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> my

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
so as you can see I have all of my

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.969 
so as you can see I have all of my
stitches<00:01:37.619> in

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
stitches in

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.749 
stitches in
it's<00:01:38.100> basically<00:01:38.549> purl<00:01:39.360> knit<00:01:39.479> purl<00:01:39.750> knit<00:01:40.259> purl

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
it's basically purl knit purl knit purl

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.410 
it's basically purl knit purl knit purl
you<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.880> pretty<00:01:42.540> basic<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:44.420> two

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you know pretty basic so I have two

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
you know pretty basic so I have two
cables<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.799> row

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
cables that I'm going to do on this row

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
cables that I'm going to do on this row
this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> basic<00:01:48.240> braid<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.649> if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this is a basic braid I don't know if

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.010 
this is a basic braid I don't know if
you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.920> tell<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.530> gonna<00:01:52.680> start<00:01:52.979> off

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
you can tell that so I'm gonna start off

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.580 
you can tell that so I'm gonna start off
first<00:01:55.020> by<00:01:55.290> pulling<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> through<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.310> loop<00:01:57.590> two

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
first by pulling it through one loop two

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.810 
first by pulling it through one loop two
loops

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.280 

and<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:01.630> I'm<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:04.270> these<00:02:04.420> three<00:02:04.720> to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
and then I'm going to do these three to

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.780 
and then I'm going to do these three to
get<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.800> center<00:02:06.220> now<00:02:08.580> here's<00:02:09.580> my

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
get it to the center now here's my

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.010 
get it to the center now here's my
technique<00:02:10.620> I'm<00:02:11.620> gonna<00:02:11.830> pull<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.750> working

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
technique I'm gonna pull the working

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.400 
technique I'm gonna pull the working
loop<00:02:14.410> off<00:02:14.710> my<00:02:15.280> crochet<00:02:15.580> hook<00:02:15.760> make<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.810> nice

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
loop off my crochet hook make it nice

and big so I don't accidentally pull it
out<00:02:20.280> now<00:02:21.280> I'm<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> take<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.360> bobby<00:02:22.600> pin

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
out now I'm going to take the bobby pin

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.690 
out now I'm going to take the bobby pin
I'm<00:02:23.200> gonna<00:02:23.410> put<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.800> through<00:02:23.830> these<00:02:24.280> three

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I'm gonna put it through these three

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.340 
I'm gonna put it through these three
these<00:02:25.090> three<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.570> gonna<00:02:25.690> be<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> ones<00:02:26.200> that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
these three are gonna be the ones that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.830 
these three are gonna be the ones that
I'm<00:02:26.410> going<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.560> switch<00:02:26.710> over<00:02:26.950> right<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
I'm going to switch over right so I

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.440 
I'm going to switch over right so I
slide<00:02:29.500> them<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.330> they're

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
slide them on like that so they're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.570 
slide them on like that so they're
pretty<00:02:31.570> secure<00:02:32.050> because<00:02:32.260> bobby<00:02:32.560> pins<00:02:32.890> are

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
pretty secure because bobby pins are

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.970 
pretty secure because bobby pins are
designed<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.420> now<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.680> pull

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
designed to do that now I can just pull

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.210 
designed to do that now I can just pull
the<00:02:36.220> loops<00:02:36.459> off<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:37.060> my<00:02:37.180> crochet<00:02:37.420> hook<00:02:38.220> there's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
the loops off of my crochet hook there's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.050 
the loops off of my crochet hook there's
never<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.640> fear<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.810> these<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.230> gonna<00:02:41.350> go<00:02:42.060> it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
never a fear that these are gonna go it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
secure so I'm gonna move my bobby pin to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.480 
secure so I'm gonna move my bobby pin to
the<00:02:49.060> back<00:02:49.240> because<00:02:50.050> that's<00:02:50.230> what<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.680> this

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.820 
the back because that's what the this
cable<00:02:51.940> calls<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.420> I'm<00:02:53.260> gonna<00:02:53.440> take<00:02:53.650> my

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
cable calls for I'm gonna take my

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.160 
cable calls for I'm gonna take my
working<00:02:54.280> loop<00:02:54.489> put<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> crochet

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
working loop put it back on a crochet

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.430 
working loop put it back on a crochet

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
gap here so what I do is I pinch it so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.570 
gap here so what I do is I pinch it so

impossible<00:03:54.760> for<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.480> loop<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:55.870> pulled

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
impossible for the loop to be pulled

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.970 
impossible for the loop to be pulled
tight<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.019> good<00:03:59.230> for<00:03:59.260> me<00:03:59.470> because<00:03:59.799> I'm

here<00:04:49.390> do<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.480> same<00:04:50.690> thing<00:04:50.930> pull<00:04:51.650> off<00:04:51.800> this

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
here do the same thing pull off this

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.400 
here do the same thing pull off this
take<00:04:54.770> my<00:04:54.919> bobby<00:04:55.100> pin<00:04:55.540> slide<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.960> under<00:04:57.200> here

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
take my bobby pin slide it under here

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.530 
take my bobby pin slide it under here
one<00:04:58.070> thing<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.340> have<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.520> watch<00:04:58.790> out<00:04:59.030> for<00:04:59.270> if

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
one thing you have to watch out for if

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.210 
one thing you have to watch out for if
you<00:04:59.750> have<00:04:59.900> yarn<00:05:00.200> that's<00:05:00.440> prone<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.890> splitting

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
you have yarn that's prone to splitting

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.970 
you have yarn that's prone to splitting
don't<00:05:02.120> stick<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.690> bobby<00:05:02.900> pin<00:05:03.260> through<00:05:03.650> the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
don't stick the bobby pin through the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.490 
don't stick the bobby pin through the
yarn<00:05:04.310> don't<00:05:04.610> grab<00:05:04.910> half<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.600> yarn<00:05:05.810> or<00:05:06.080> half

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
yarn don't grab half of the yarn or half

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.720 
yarn don't grab half of the yarn or half
of<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.740> loop<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:08.410> there<00:05:09.410> secure<00:05:10.130> in<00:05:10.250> here<00:05:10.550> I

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
of the loop so there secure in here I

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.320 
of the loop so there secure in here I
take<00:05:11.150> off<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.480> three<00:05:11.690> loops<00:05:12.610> never<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.880> danger

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
take off the three loops never in danger

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.150 
take off the three loops never in danger
of<00:05:14.450> them<00:05:14.630> falling<00:05:14.930> off<00:05:15.200> I<00:05:15.440> can't<00:05:15.650> hold<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:16.040> I

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
of them falling off I can't hold it I

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.670 
of them falling off I can't hold it I
can<00:05:16.400> move<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.700> around<00:05:16.840> it's<00:05:17.840> totally<00:05:18.290> secure

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
can move it around it's totally secure

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.590 
can move it around it's totally secure
because<00:05:19.070> these<00:05:19.220> bobby<00:05:19.460> pins<00:05:19.910> pitch<00:05:20.240> them<00:05:20.419> down

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
because these bobby pins pitch them down

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.930 
because these bobby pins pitch them down
and<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.560> can<00:05:21.710> probably<00:05:22.010> do<00:05:22.400> this<00:05:22.580> with<00:05:22.790> any

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
and you can probably do this with any

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.310 
and you can probably do this with any
yarn<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:23.390> is<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.630> DK<00:05:24.530> weight<00:05:24.560> yarn<00:05:24.830> so<00:05:25.729> I<00:05:26.320> could

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
yarn this is a DK weight yarn so I could

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.630 
yarn this is a DK weight yarn so I could
imagine<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.800> can<00:05:27.950> do<00:05:28.040> this<00:05:28.220> with<00:05:28.400> any<00:05:28.520> size

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
imagine you can do this with any size

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.270 
imagine you can do this with any size
yarn<00:05:29.060> so<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.200> one<00:05:30.470> I'm<00:05:30.680> gonna<00:05:30.830> hold<00:05:31.100> in<00:05:31.220> the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
yarn so this one I'm gonna hold in the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.260 
yarn so this one I'm gonna hold in the
front<00:05:32.710> put<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.830> working<00:05:34.160> loop<00:05:34.340> back<00:05:34.520> on<00:05:34.729> pull

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
front put the working loop back on pull

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.730 
front put the working loop back on pull
it<00:05:35.360> tight<00:05:36.910> pinch<00:05:37.910> it<00:05:38.320> so<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.530> are

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
it tight pinch it so that that are

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.310 
it tight pinch it so that that are
together<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:41.000> may<00:05:41.120> sound<00:05:41.419> weird<00:05:41.690> pinching<00:05:42.229> it

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
together it may sound weird pinching it

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.719 
together it may sound weird pinching it
together<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:43.010> sounds<00:05:43.190> like<00:05:43.430> you're<00:05:43.580> cheating

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
together it sounds like you're cheating

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.260 
together it sounds like you're cheating
but<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.300> actually<00:05:44.750> works<00:05:44.930> out<00:05:45.140> so<00:05:46.100> do<00:05:47.090> these

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
but it actually works out so do these

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.290 
but it actually works out so do these
three<00:05:50.169> don't<00:05:51.169> forget<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.680> chain<00:05:51.950> one<00:05:52.300> that

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
three don't forget to chain one that

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.580 
three don't forget to chain one that
makes<00:05:53.570> your<00:05:53.720> cables<00:05:54.080> pop<00:05:55.330> then<00:05:56.330> pull<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.260> loop

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.850 

stick<00:06:00.590> these<00:06:00.770> back<00:06:01.100> on

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.370 

pull<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.980> bobby<00:06:06.160> pin<00:06:06.460> off<00:06:06.960> put<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.080> working

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
pull the bobby pin off put the working

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.160 
pull the bobby pin off put the working
loop<00:06:08.560> back<00:06:08.740> on<00:06:09.660> see<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:10.720> actually<00:06:10.810> works

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
loop back on see it actually works

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.210 
loop back on see it actually works
pretty<00:06:11.260> quick<00:06:11.680> you<00:06:11.920> have<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.250> stretch<00:06:13.180> out<00:06:13.390> the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
pretty quick you have to stretch out the

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.210 
pretty quick you have to stretch out the
working<00:06:15.220> loop<00:06:15.400> twice<00:06:15.700> but<00:06:16.660> I<00:06:16.930> think<00:06:17.890> it<00:06:17.980> saves

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
working loop twice but I think it saves

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.880 
working loop twice but I think it saves
time<00:06:18.550> and<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:19.810> know<00:06:19.900> not<00:06:20.110> losing<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.650> entire

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
time and you know not losing the entire

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.650 
time and you know not losing the entire
row<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:21.580> not<00:06:21.700> having<00:06:21.880> across<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.450> stitches

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
row and not having across the stitches

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.550 
row and not having across the stitches
or<00:06:22.990> anything<00:06:23.200> like<00:06:23.350> that<00:06:23.410> so<00:06:23.830> I'm<00:06:24.490> gonna<00:06:24.610> work

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
or anything like that so I'm gonna work

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.370 
or anything like that so I'm gonna work
these<00:06:26.560> last<00:06:27.150> three<00:06:29.190> knits<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:30.840> I'm<00:06:31.840> home<00:06:32.110> free

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
these last three knits and I'm home free

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.980 
these last three knits and I'm home free
I<00:06:32.410> can<00:06:32.620> do<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.830> rest<00:06:33.010> of<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.190> row<00:06:35.640> I'm<00:06:36.640> done<00:06:39.990> so

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
I can do the rest of the row I'm done so

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.220 
I can do the rest of the row I'm done so
it's<00:06:41.110> pretty<00:06:41.260> quick<00:06:41.560> I<00:06:41.800> did<00:06:42.130> two<00:06:42.280> cables<00:06:43.230> three

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
it's pretty quick I did two cables three

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.790 
it's pretty quick I did two cables three
stitches<00:06:44.590> each<00:06:44.890> I'm<00:06:45.880> done<00:06:46.240> with<00:06:46.360> the<00:06:46.480> row<00:06:46.800> and

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
stitches each I'm done with the row and

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.940 
stitches each I'm done with the row and
it<00:06:47.980> looks<00:06:48.130> like<00:06:48.190> a<00:06:48.310> mess<00:06:48.630> but<00:06:49.630> on<00:06:50.080> my<00:06:50.920> first

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
it looks like a mess but on my first

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.860 
it looks like a mess but on my first
second<00:06:51.640> and<00:06:51.670> third<00:06:51.880> row<00:06:52.090> after<00:06:52.420> this<00:06:52.570> it'll

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
second and third row after this it'll

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.960 
second and third row after this it'll
look<00:06:52.960> much<00:06:53.170> better<00:06:53.380> that's<00:06:54.160> the<00:06:54.280> technique<00:06:54.790> I

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
look much better that's the technique I

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.540 
look much better that's the technique I
used<00:06:55.210> for<00:06:55.570> this<00:06:55.900> entire<00:06:56.230> thing<00:06:56.500> use<00:06:57.430> the

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
used for this entire thing use the

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.520 
used for this entire thing use the
different<00:06:57.850> technique<00:06:58.180> down<00:06:58.390> here<00:06:58.780> I<00:06:58.960> didn't

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
different technique down here I didn't

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.840 
different technique down here I didn't
really<00:06:59.590> like<00:06:59.920> it<00:06:59.950> or<00:07:00.250> I<00:07:00.310> just<00:07:00.670> wasn't

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
really like it or I just wasn't

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.770 
really like it or I just wasn't
experienced<00:07:02.520> so<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.850> like<00:07:04.030> this<00:07:04.240> up<00:07:04.420> here<00:07:04.660> it

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
experienced so I like this up here it

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.280 
experienced so I like this up here it
looks<00:07:04.810> nice<00:07:05.230> and<00:07:05.440> smooth<00:07:05.740> they<00:07:05.980> pop<00:07:06.250> and

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
looks nice and smooth they pop and

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.270 
looks nice and smooth they pop and
that's<00:07:08.290> my<00:07:08.410> method<00:07:09.030> thanks<00:07:10.030> a<00:07:10.090> lot
