00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:19.830 
there but that's okay and then it's
going<00:03:08.370> down<00:03:08.549> pretty<00:03:08.910> quick

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:33.830 

I've<00:03:20.840> got<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.989> stopper<00:03:21.469> on<00:03:21.500> it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that's about as low as I can go without

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.670 
that's about as low as I can go without
sucking<00:03:36.599> up<00:03:36.810> any<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> east<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.980> looks<00:03:38.220> like

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
sucking up any of the east it looks like

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:49.200 
sucking up any of the east it looks like
maybe<00:03:42.680> maybe<00:03:43.680> talk

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.240 

okay<00:03:51.040> i'm<00:03:52.040> starting<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.490> get<00:03:52.640> i<00:03:53.800> got<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.830> raisin

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250

okay i'm starting to get i got a raisin
in<00:03:55.310> there<00:03:55.520> so<00:03:56.450> I'm<00:03:56.480> stopping<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.530> right<00:03:57.680> now

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.490 

just<00:04:03.830> a<00:04:03.920> little<00:04:04.130> tiny<00:04:04.400> bit<00:04:04.520> left<00:04:04.820> okay<00:04:05.500> all

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
just a little tiny bit left okay all

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.860 
just a little tiny bit left okay all
right<00:04:06.710> so<00:04:07.370> that's<00:04:07.760> basically<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.450> right<00:04:08.660> there

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
right so that's basically it right there

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.720 
right so that's basically it right there
I<00:04:09.080> don't<00:04:09.920> think<00:04:09.980> I'm<00:04:10.160> going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.340> get<00:04:10.490> any<00:04:10.610> of

bit prepared to this little cloudy but

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.929 
bit prepared to this little cloudy but
the<00:05:08.060> time<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.240> try<00:05:08.480> it

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.219 

there's<00:05:12.939> definitely<00:05:13.210> some<00:05:13.539> alcohol<00:05:13.930> content

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
in there

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.580 
in there
hmm<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.400> it's<00:05:19.000> kind<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.240> unique<00:05:19.389> tasting<00:05:19.930> with

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
hmm and it's kind of unique tasting with

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.750

the chocolate

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.880 
the chocolate
I<00:05:24.340> would<00:05:25.340> not<00:05:25.490> order<00:05:25.790> that<00:05:25.820> on<00:05:26.090> purpose<00:05:26.330> a

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890

not but he stalls a long ways to go
right<00:05:34.880> here<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:37.000> probably<00:05:38.000> let<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.240> sit<00:05:38.480> in<00:05:38.600> here

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
right here I probably let it sit in here

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.060 
right here I probably let it sit in here
for<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:39.020> month<00:05:39.190> or<00:05:40.190> two<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:41.680> then<00:05:42.680> I'll<00:05:42.830> put<00:05:43.010> it

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
for a month or two and then I'll put it

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.440 
for a month or two and then I'll put it
in<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.250> bottles<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:43.700> then<00:05:43.910> we'll<00:05:44.240> let<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
in the bottles and then we'll let the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.600 
in the bottles and then we'll let the
bottle<00:05:44.720> sit<00:05:44.930> for<00:05:45.140> a<00:05:45.170> few<00:05:45.530> months<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.370> see

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
bottle sit for a few months to the see

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.700 
bottle sit for a few months to the see
how<00:05:46.730> they<00:05:46.850> go<00:05:47.230> there's<00:05:48.230> definitely<00:05:48.560> some

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
how they go there's definitely some

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.260 
how they go there's definitely some
alcohol<00:05:49.040> content<00:05:49.280> in<00:05:49.550> there<00:05:49.670> though<00:05:49.790> this

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
alcohol content in there though this

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.270 
alcohol content in there though this
one's<00:05:50.480> next<00:05:50.720> we'll<00:05:51.590> probably<00:05:51.770> do<00:05:51.920> this<00:05:52.070> one

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
one's next we'll probably do this one

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.370 
one's next we'll probably do this one
tomorrow<00:05:52.850> or<00:05:53.180> for<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.690> next<00:05:53.960> couple<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.230> days

tomorrow or for the next couple of days
I<00:05:54.650> don't<00:05:55.580> think<00:05:55.640> I'll<00:05:55.820> need<00:05:55.850> to<00:05:56.030> film<00:05:56.240> it

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.910 
I don't think I'll need to film it
though<00:05:56.540> because<00:05:57.140> it'll<00:05:57.440> be<00:05:57.500> about<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.800> same

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
though because it'll be about the same

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.450 
though because it'll be about the same
