there got a little corrosion on it
I<00:00:49.059> had<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.539> slightly<00:00:49.809> bend<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.410> tabs<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:51.160> this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
I had to slightly bend the tabs of this

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360 
I had to slightly bend the tabs of this
out<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.809> get<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.230> work<00:00:53.440> but<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:54.070> way<00:00:54.219> it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
out to get it to work but the way it

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.319 
out to get it to work but the way it
works<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.910> this<00:00:55.030> rotating<00:00:56.219> shaft<00:00:57.219> made<00:00:57.969> some

I'm going to try and see if I can have

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.119 
I'm going to try and see if I can have
good<00:03:10.510> control<00:03:12.239> without<00:03:13.239> having<00:03:13.629> that<00:03:14.129> hold

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
good control without having that hold

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.000 
good control without having that hold

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
down the accelerator pedal I'm gonna try

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:30.670 
down the accelerator pedal I'm gonna try
just

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.320 

yeah<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.890> seems<00:03:32.129> pretty<00:03:32.400> good<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.940> engines

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
yeah that seems pretty good the engines

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.030 
yeah that seems pretty good the engines
running<00:03:33.599> let's<00:03:34.049> take<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> look<00:03:34.590> at<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.830> here

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
running let's take a look at it here

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.580 
running let's take a look at it here
seems<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.150> it's<00:03:36.330> running<00:03:36.629> smoothly

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.850 

yeah<00:03:44.590> it's<00:03:44.950> odd<00:03:45.159> look<00:03:45.430> very<00:03:45.700> smooth<00:03:46.860> this

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
yeah it's odd look very smooth this

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.619 
yeah it's odd look very smooth this
never<00:03:48.190> would<00:03:48.430> have<00:03:48.459> happened<00:03:48.580> before<00:03:49.150> what

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
never would have happened before what

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.530 
never would have happened before what
the<00:03:49.780> old<00:03:50.110> coke<00:03:50.470> system<00:03:51.040> hopefully<00:03:52.030> won't<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.450> a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
the old coke system hopefully won't in a

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.330 
the old coke system hopefully won't in a
dying<00:03:52.840> out<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.379> seems<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.799> it's<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:56.340> don't

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
dying out it seems like it's I don't

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.920 
dying out it seems like it's I don't
know<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.610> I'm<00:04:00.730> trying<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.090> experiment<00:04:01.810> with

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
know and I'm trying to experiment with

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.240 
know and I'm trying to experiment with
settings<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.440> choke<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.860> will<00:04:02.950> keep<00:04:03.099> the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
settings of the choke that will keep the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.140 
settings of the choke that will keep the
engine<00:04:03.640> running<00:04:06.810> okay<00:04:07.810> there<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.379> go<00:04:09.150> it's

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
engine running okay there we go it's

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.129 
engine running okay there we go it's
running<00:04:10.480> pretty<00:04:10.659> smoothly

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.640 

and<00:04:17.500> push<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:17.949> in<00:04:18.189> a<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.489> bit<00:04:19.439> and<00:04:20.439> it's

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
and push it in a little bit and it's

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.520 
and push it in a little bit and it's
starting<00:04:21.009> to<00:04:21.629> start<00:04:22.629> in<00:04:22.720> hesitate<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:23.259> little

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
starting to start in hesitate a little

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.650 
starting to start in hesitate a little
bit<00:04:23.710> we<00:04:24.039> do<00:04:24.159> it<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.310> little<00:04:24.430> bit<00:04:24.699> less<00:04:25.479> choke

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.160 

but<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.260> really<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:31.830> having<00:04:32.040> this<00:04:32.310> control

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
but I really like having this control

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.750 
but I really like having this control
that's<00:04:34.170> like<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.530> don't<00:04:34.710> know<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.190> don't<00:04:35.580> know

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that's like I don't know I don't know

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.470 
that's like I don't know I don't know
why<00:04:35.940> they<00:04:36.150> didn't<00:04:36.680> always<00:04:37.680> have<00:04:38.180> nano<00:04:39.180> choke

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
why they didn't always have nano choke

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.290 
why they didn't always have nano choke
adjustments<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.230> guess<00:04:40.410> they<00:04:41.090> ideally<00:04:42.090> that

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
adjustments I guess they ideally that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.360 
adjustments I guess they ideally that
the<00:04:42.990> thermostatic<00:04:43.560> controls<00:04:43.980> supposed<00:04:44.280> to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
the thermostatic controls supposed to

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.360 
the thermostatic controls supposed to
compensate<00:04:44.940> for<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.330> but<00:04:45.650> we<00:04:46.650> try<00:04:46.920> pushing<00:04:47.220> it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
compensate for you but we try pushing it

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.150 
compensate for you but we try pushing it
a<00:04:47.520> little<00:04:47.550> bit<00:04:47.970> more<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:49.440> just<00:04:49.470> try<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:49.920> find

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
a little bit more and just try and find

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.480 
a little bit more and just try and find
the<00:04:50.340> optimal<00:04:50.940> setting<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:53.040> will<00:04:53.130> keep<00:04:53.310> it

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
the optimal setting it will keep it

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.090 
the optimal setting it will keep it
running<00:04:53.760> smoothly<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.390> allow<00:04:54.620> by<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.680> end<00:04:55.980> of

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
running smoothly and allow by the end of

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.140 
running smoothly and allow by the end of
the<00:04:56.220> stay<00:04:56.460> running<00:04:58.400> when<00:04:59.400> they<00:04:59.520> come<00:04:59.760> up<00:04:59.910> here

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the stay running when they come up here

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:10.190 
the stay running when they come up here
and<00:05:00.210> take<00:05:00.390> another<00:05:00.630> look<00:05:00.960> at<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:09.390> carburetor

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
and take another look at the carburetor

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.650 
and take another look at the carburetor
make<00:05:10.800> sure<00:05:11.070> there's<00:05:11.280> no<00:05:11.460> oil<00:05:11.820> leaks<00:05:12.270> or

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
make sure there's no oil leaks or

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:24.220 
make sure there's no oil leaks or
anything<00:05:13.070> in<00:05:14.070> there<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:22.460> finally<00:05:23.460> did<00:05:23.700> it

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
anything in there I finally did it

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.770 
anything in there I finally did it
