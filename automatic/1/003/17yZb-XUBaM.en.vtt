let's<00:01:21.190> see<00:01:21.430> how<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.120> autofocus<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.990> like<00:01:23.170> when

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
let's see how the autofocus is like when

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.969 
let's see how the autofocus is like when
we<00:01:23.320> get<00:01:23.500> up<00:01:23.590> close<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:26.200> pretty<00:01:26.500> good<00:01:26.680> and

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
we get up close that's pretty good and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.260 
we get up close that's pretty good and
look<00:01:27.130> at<00:01:27.220> that<00:01:27.310> depth<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.610> field<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.090> back

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
look at that depth of field in the back

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.620 
look at that depth of field in the back
like<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:30.490> pretty<00:01:31.320> sharp<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:33.510> focus<00:01:34.510> is

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
like it's pretty sharp like focus is

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.350 
like it's pretty sharp like focus is
better<00:01:34.840> than<00:01:34.990> my<00:01:35.080> DSLR<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:36.640> at<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:39.360> there's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
better than my DSLR look at that there's

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.790 
better than my DSLR look at that there's
like<00:01:40.570> some<00:01:40.780> bird<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.290> palm<00:01:41.500> tree<00:01:43.800> it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
recording I don't know if that's my

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.730 
recording I don't know if that's my
space<00:01:51.820> limitation<00:01:52.660> or<00:01:52.930> that's<00:01:53.259> just<00:01:53.530> some

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
space limitation or that's just some

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:06.300 
space limitation or that's just some
software<00:01:54.310> thing
