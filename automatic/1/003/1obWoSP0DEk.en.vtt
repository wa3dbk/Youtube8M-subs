00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 We have been fighting with this company to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.430
 that can represent peers and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.200
 accustom what 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.540
 unfortunately for this they are going to have 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.020
 to deal with us so that the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.300
 comrades within sports trustees 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.550
 of represented as we do throughout 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.470
 the Argentina Republic had complaint 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.230
 that they had entered breaking glass and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.850

 the need of each worker is like that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.209
 that we have it very clear that they are 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.709
 the workers who pay us the 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.900
 What our salaries pay us 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.870
