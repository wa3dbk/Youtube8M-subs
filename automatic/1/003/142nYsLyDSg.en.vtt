00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
lot most of the common turtles are very

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.429 
lot most of the common turtles are very
cheap<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.359> find<00:00:18.630> them<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:18.810> twenty

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
cheap you can find them for twenty

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.550 
cheap you can find them for twenty
dollars<00:00:19.800> or<00:00:19.980> less<00:00:21.050> but<00:00:22.050> here's<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> thing

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
dollars or less but here's the thing

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
dollars or less but here's the thing
they<00:00:22.890> live<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.519> really<00:00:24.119> long<00:00:24.510> time<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.580> they

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
they live a really long time and they

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.540 
they live a really long time and they
get<00:00:26.820> quite<00:00:27.150> large<00:00:27.210> most<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.400> mine's<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
get quite large most of them mine's a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
get quite large most of them mine's a
male<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.939> male<00:00:30.060> stay<00:00:30.390> smaller<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.990> he's<00:00:31.199> at

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
male and male stay smaller and he's at

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.760 
male and male stay smaller and he's at
like<00:00:32.009> eight<00:00:32.309> inches<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.149> now<00:00:33.329> which<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
like eight inches right now which is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.819 
like eight inches right now which is
quite<00:00:34.770> large<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> really

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
quite large so you have to have a really

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
quite large so you have to have a really
large<00:00:38.010> tank<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:38.850> lots<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.750> water<00:00:39.989> which

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
large tank for them lots of water which

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
large tank for them lots of water which
is<00:00:40.290> quite<00:00:40.649> messy<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.250> turtles<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.000> messy

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
is quite messy because turtles are messy

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
is quite messy because turtles are messy
and<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.040> thinking<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.280> getting

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and so if you're thinking about getting

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
and so if you're thinking about getting
a<00:00:44.640> turtle<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.030> box<00:00:45.329> turtle<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> great<00:00:46.350> option

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
a turtle a box turtle is a great option

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.060 
a turtle a box turtle is a great option
because<00:00:47.059> box<00:00:48.059> turtles<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.590> need<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> big

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
because box turtles you do need a big

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
because box turtles you do need a big
enclosure<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:51.719> live<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
enclosure for them but they live on the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.920 
enclosure for them but they live on the
land<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.030> there's<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> water<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
land so there's not all the water that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.020 
land so there's not all the water that
you're<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> clean<00:00:55.949> Josh<00:00:56.789> do

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you're going to have to clean Josh do

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
you're going to have to clean Josh do

i've<00:01:13.439> stepped<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> lego<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> few<00:01:14.729> times

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
i've stepped on a lego a few times

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
i've stepped on a lego a few times
before<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.250> didn't<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.610> i've

heard that much do you think it would be
a<00:01:19.890> good<00:01:20.040> idea<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.790> every<00:01:21.150> five<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.780> q<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
a good idea if like every five and q and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
a good idea if like every five and q and
A's<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.799> whatever<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.700> answered<00:01:24.060> every

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
A's or whatever you answered every

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
A's or whatever you answered every
question<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.049> made<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> video<00:01:25.740> twice<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.340> long

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
question and made a video twice as long

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.380 
question and made a video twice as long
as<00:01:26.670> regular<00:01:27.170> well<00:01:28.170> maybe<00:01:28.590> i<00:01:29.250> would<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
as regular well maybe i would like to be

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
as regular well maybe i would like to be
able<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> answer<00:01:30.750> every<00:01:31.110> question<00:01:31.439> because

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
able to answer every question because

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.300 
able to answer every question because
that<00:01:32.909> would<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.119> interesting<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.310> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that would be interesting but it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
that would be interesting but it
wouldn't<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.790> twice<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.060> long<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.630> regular

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
wouldn't be twice as long as regular

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.999 
wouldn't be twice as long as regular
because<00:01:37.350> i<00:01:37.680> oftentimes<00:01:38.430> pick<00:01:38.970> between<00:01:39.799> 10<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
because i oftentimes pick between 10 and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.780 
because i oftentimes pick between 10 and
20<00:01:41.460> 2<00:01:41.790> comments<00:01:42.270> /<00:01:42.780> video<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.790> there's
