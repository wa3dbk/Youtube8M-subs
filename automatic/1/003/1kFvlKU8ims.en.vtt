celery so I went ahead and already
chopped<00:01:00.850> this<00:01:00.999> up<00:01:01.269> as<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:02.140> can<00:01:02.319> see<00:01:02.530> here<00:01:02.949> we

chopped this up as you can see here we
are<00:01:04.360> I'm<00:01:04.720> sorry<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.110> left<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:06.750> skin<00:01:07.750> on<00:01:08.110> the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
are I'm sorry I left the skin on the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.290 
are I'm sorry I left the skin on the
apples<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.100> reason<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.550> I<00:01:09.610> left<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.060> skin

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
apples the reason that I left the skin

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.930 
apples the reason that I left the skin
on<00:01:10.360> because<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.320> actually<00:01:11.890> adds<00:01:12.100> more<00:01:12.460> fiber

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
on because it actually adds more fiber

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.780 
on because it actually adds more fiber
every<00:01:13.870> single<00:01:14.620> fruit<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:14.950> vegetable<00:01:15.400> the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
every single fruit and vegetable the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.280 
every single fruit and vegetable the
skin<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.390> actually<00:01:16.510> where<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.840> get<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.050> most

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
skin is actually where you get the most

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.110 
skin is actually where you get the most
fiber<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.040> when<00:01:18.160> you<00:01:18.220> take<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.550> off<00:01:18.820> you're

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
fiber so when you take that off you're

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.210 
fiber so when you take that off you're
actually<00:01:19.480> getting<00:01:19.750> less<00:01:19.900> fiber<00:01:20.230> so<00:01:20.620> anything

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
actually getting less fiber so anything

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.430 
actually getting less fiber so anything
we<00:01:21.310> can<00:01:21.340> do<00:01:21.550> to<00:01:21.670> increase<00:01:21.850> fiber<00:01:22.270> will<00:01:22.600> help<00:01:22.870> so

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
we can do to increase fiber will help so

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.540 
we can do to increase fiber will help so
just<00:01:23.500> leave<00:01:23.950> them<00:01:24.160> on<00:01:26.070> while<00:01:27.070> you're<00:01:27.250> chopping

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
just leave them on while you're chopping

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.100 
just leave them on while you're chopping
and<00:01:27.940> then<00:01:28.180> we're<00:01:28.300> just<00:01:28.330> going<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.630> kind<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:28.900> mix

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
and then we're just going to kind of mix

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.260 
and then we're just going to kind of mix
here<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.770> stir<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.310> up<00:01:30.520> kind<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.120> get

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
here and stir this up kind of get

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.980 
here and stir this up kind of get
