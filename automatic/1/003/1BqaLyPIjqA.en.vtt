00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.279
 Well, I'm very happy with the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.710
 book I'm really happy and very 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.139
 excited and I hope you like it is a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 material that was made with much desire 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 We were very excited 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.800
 time working and is done with what 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.660
 best of us I hope you like it and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 now if we are going to review a little bit 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.830
 for this man bathing mesh a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.750
 little trouser because on the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.220
 I'm going to elaborate afterwards the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.900
 outer mold is notice I'm 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.750
 to work with distal 50's of man 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.899
 with these measurements waist 92 hip 108 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.489
 height of hip 21 height of shot these 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.200
 same measurements I took it from the table 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.450
 anthropometric that is in the bank of 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.430
 data so you can ask but 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.520
 I want to clarify that this workshop 50 of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 man matches the size 46 of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 that is to say in our country 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.730
 that we have two numbering is one in the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.379
 national average others the measure is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.449
 right in the book there is a chapter 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.460
 where I explain this topic of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.660
 numbers so you can see that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.630
 this same man who has size 50 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.170
 national is 46 of pants 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.000
 and in the case of the shirt is 40 is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.500
 three different workshops that's why you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 Ask your husband what workshops and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 you will never see then look at this 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.420
 46 of pants or 50 national if then 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.429
 what I am going to do first is a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.789
 trouser box with the room 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:29.549
 hip always taken with looseness x 106 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.649
 which is the length of pants where you take 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.630
 in the middle of the knee height I take 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.569
 Hip height and shooting height 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.000
 everything as we do in the range pants 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:42.090
 when the crotch of the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.890
 front is always 15% of the room 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 of hip as in lady is going to have 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.240
 some modifications with respect to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.539
 Lady pants but notice that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 would be that 15% of 27 plus or minus 4 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.840
 centimeters and well round as if 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 we made with compass I make the shot and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.069
 then a constant that I'm going to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.799
 work on men's pants 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.509
 remember this of 2 and a half 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.250
 because I'm going to repeat the 2 and a half 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.890
 two and a half centimeters in different 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.420
 places of the pants first I will go down 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 two and a half in the center of the tape 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.910
 and I'm going to take two and a half here as for 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.580
 draw the hip is the hip look 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.970
 that is half round and it's like this and it's going 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.640
 ending up almost the same in this 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.459
 I'm going to draw part with a rule 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.370
 well and there I have two and a half van hecke already 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.760
 two and a half between is to draw the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.670
 Look pant leg to be 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.380
 he plumbed his leg and from here he came to nothing 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.620
 and I brought the rectangle to nothing 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.720
 yes and the same four centimeters that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.209
 I took here I'm going to take them in the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.190
 outer side and that way it's going to 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.980
 take the leg of the pants and there 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.760
 I have the forward drawn look what 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.400
 easy is I about this that I'm going to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.130
 draw the bathroom shorts but first 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.110
 I want to draw the butt is I 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.269
 I went through the other side, look what I did 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.519
 I have a striker here that even louis 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.670
 in red because I want to start drawing 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.280
 the butt in black to be noticed and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.170
 always this tripled measure is to say 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.450
 that if I had four centimeters 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 have 12 centimeters 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.950
 12 centimeters there are three times the measure 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.530
 of the forward shot then I come 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.290
 with the leg of the pants the leg of the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.700
 pants will be exactly the same 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.819
 up here to knee height 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.130
 look exactly the same until the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.910
 knee 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.480
 there is the termination this form comes 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.040
 here even changes with respect to the lady 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.560
 because men's pants come like this and 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.870
 go straight at this point do not take the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.540
 same hip shape as the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.650
 forward is straight as follows 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.440
 base box let's say and this way of 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.540
 this way that I have 26 centimeters 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.180
 here I take the crotch will have to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.670
 go sewn with this line until I 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 shock notice that it falls a little 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.570
 because if I do it at the same height 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.639
 is going to have a major tour this line 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.510
 have to sew with this line of 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.750
 back and well half redondito well there 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.760
 it is notice 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.830
 I go back in two and a half centimeters 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.440
 to draw the waist I go back in 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.140
 two and a half centimeters and I go back up 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.130
 two and a half centimeters two and a half two 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.170
 and half is from this point that I arrive 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.940
 two and a half two and a half I have to spend 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.190
 by this point that is the hip and 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.810
 I can not enlarge or shrink online 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.810
 straight I'm going to make a straight line here 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.190
 and the shot is drawn from here passing through 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.919
 the tip of the front shot and 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.889
 arriving at this point without fear because 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.200
 you will never be wrong about this how 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.970
 finished the waist the waist determined 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.860
 in a straight line how much do they have to 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.550
 let's do the two rear clamp and 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.260
 Through which long always remember that 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.480
 the length of the clip has to do with 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.550
 the depth if I have a clamp 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.530
 two and a half at least 12 13 or 14 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.970
 centimeters long I can play with 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.590
 those long ones I finished the review of 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.380
 the base of the trousers hands to draw if 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.330
 now short yours for this to be a 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.860
 bathroom shorts I can not work with 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.970
 This measure of hip contour 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.610
 little to be a pair pants 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.260
 follow me I have to give it amplitude is 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.510
 amplitude that sometimes in the pants of 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.280
 man gives it the pricked both in the 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.080
 trousers for men as the trousers 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.110
 children we do not wear type pants 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.690
 yes, we need it to be broad and 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.960
 amplitude we can give a short of 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.180
 two and a half bath then we give two and 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.699
 means here notice two and a half 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.080
 the same thing I will do in the back two and 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:03.150
 half two and a half yes and I start to draw 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.780
 that would be an amplitude that would give me 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:11.009
 for a wide pants milestones and long 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.190
 we are going to give him pants 40 or 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:17.009
 want 42 and a half and two and a half 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.780
 hem understood then look at me 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.729
 what I'm going to do is take this 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.130
 up, giving it a little more 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.289
 amplitude because they are going to see that already 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.360
 Laura is going to show you what those pants are 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:30.630
 done with the waist apart is 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.250
 then the same thing does this this is what 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.259
 same thing that I'm doing in the front 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.479
 two and a half amplitude we do it 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.460
 in the butt this clamp we're going to 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.300
 cancel and if we are going to arrive with a 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.699
 little bit 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.280
 more of breadth at the waist so that 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:47.639
 give more pucker and has no more to say 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.689
 the rest is only adornment I clarify 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:54.120
 that is waist can be done 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:56.280
 whole from the harrow the false waist 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.930
 how is Laura going to be in the 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.520
 pants I am with the obsession of 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:05.129
 time I'm obsessed with you 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.550
 and the world is witness to my privilege in 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.550
 cydia
