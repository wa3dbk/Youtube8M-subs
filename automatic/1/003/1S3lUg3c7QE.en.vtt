00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
everything they've released so far I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.770 
everything they've released so far I
think<00:02:06.710> they've<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.790> they've<00:02:08.179> gotten<00:02:08.660> older

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780

their<00:02:09.289> music<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.709> progressed<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
their music is progressed in like the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.150

charity<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.180> stuff<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:13.370> yeah<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.569> think

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
charity and stuff and yeah like I think

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.300 
charity and stuff and yeah like I think
it's<00:02:16.160> much<00:02:16.340> more<00:02:16.370> heavier<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:18.250> even<00:02:19.250> though

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
it's much more heavier and even though

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.470 
it's much more heavier and even though
they<00:02:19.370> don't<00:02:19.520> wear<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.880> makeup<00:02:20.030> anymore
