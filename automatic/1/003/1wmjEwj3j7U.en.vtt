00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.970
 the origin of the commissioner who 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.130
 commissioner title comes from the navy 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.090
 the first aircraft we observed 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 they even operated in the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.360
 nelsa landed and took off from ponds 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.100
 or even of seas and with that this 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.100
 culture came into the airplane 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 my desire to be commissioner was born 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.370
 The first time I went I entered the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 large - sized aircraft was 1 767 at the time 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 and the flight attendant called me a lot. 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 attention 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.550
 she is my dream of consumption in the good 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.550
 sense 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:00.110
 sometimes this is how she travels a lot 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:05.900
 but it's with longing we can stay 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.540
 But with her later I found more than 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:17.720
 a profession a passion to fly alone 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:20.960
 serve your human side and the flora because 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.970
 you deal with people we care requires 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.979
 people laugh, people love me 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.680
 attention 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.479
 a goal can succeed very much in function 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.149
 the population that we have and 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.250
 command is supporting 0 each flight 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.560
 and then yes to trust the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.810
 training and professionalism with 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.090
 communication activity in the cabin 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.369
 understand the procedures well and ensure 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.070
 related because we are doing 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.240
 difference will not miss 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.009
 Come back home to have a lot of discipline and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.729
 a chair in front of the door to stay 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:02.240
 hoping she was enjoying 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.369
 spirit that does not arrive 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.539
 I find it more form to enter 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.539
 and I think it's one more game for this 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.099
 The night for her, too. 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.730
 this is all part of our day to day 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.880
 day by day we flight attendants 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.370
 we choose to be our lives to 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.500
 dress agents and asking commissioner 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 A lot of joy for all of us. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.709
 celebrate today that the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.709
 people deserve 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:43.420
 To say that it's a pleasure for me to have the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 board our aircraft and go 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.310
 Thank you very much for your work. 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.650
 happy day of the commissioners and that people 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.569
 can make the company the goal that people 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.569
 Congratulations to all of us.
