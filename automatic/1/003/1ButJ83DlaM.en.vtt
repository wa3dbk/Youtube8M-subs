00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.940
 like all the young people when I left the 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.980
 school I had to face the great 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.170
 question and now what model and actress 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.940
 medical communicator to help you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.040
 artist people to live on my 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
 creativity because no math and I 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.300
 they like numbers after a lot 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.950
 I finally found something that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.950
 I gathered all the engineering 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.950
 to me as to almost all women I 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.320
 love clothes and it's not necessarily 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.330
 for vanity as many might believe 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.190
 but because when I change my look 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.020
 that I am transforming as if it were 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.340
 a great actress preparing to enter 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.680
 in my being 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.300
 what I did not know is that before 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.010
 get to the shelves of the warehouses 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.080
 all those things that allow us 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.850
 transform our appearance they have already 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.309
 suffered a much more transformation 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.020
 dramatic and not only in the clothes the 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.700
 accessories and makeup but 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.410
 practically everything that surrounds us in 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.059
 daily life from gasoline that 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.510
 move the cars to the asphalt by the 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 that we walk 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.780
 to show me how it is that engineering 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.550
 chemistry is responsible for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.260
 practically all the processes of 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.300
 transformation of raw materials from 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.310
 our modern world the professor rubÃ©n 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.230
 godoy invited me to the laboratories of the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.970
 National University of Colombia and 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.250
 decided to start with an experiment with 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.970
 the simplest and most essential element for 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.800
 our subsistence the good water of 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.200
 here we have a water that has the mud 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.090
 grass land what represents a river 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.610
 polluted and we will try to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.320
 develop the purification process 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.080
 the first step is always a process 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.490
 physical in which we make a filtration 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.650
 to try to remove the pollutants 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.180
 bigger we are going to add a 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.530
 substance called sulfate 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.380
 aluminum 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.020
 let's wait a few seconds for there to be 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.770
 a good mix and we will lower the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.229
 stirring speed at about 40 or 30 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.509
 revolutions per minute here and this water 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.250
 it's drinkable it's not water yet it's not 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.140
 drinking because with the sulfate 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.090
 aluminum we eliminate organic matter 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.920
 but we have not eliminated the bacteria 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.619
 that are still present in the water 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 we need a disinfection process 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.260
 which is normally carried out 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.760
 with chlorine or with or only in some countries 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.250
 I used lightning treatment 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.470
 ultraviolet to part of the drinking water the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 Chemical engineering is also present 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.220
 in the elaboration of endless 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.799
 products of daily consumption as per 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.829
 example, milk lactose and coffee 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.049
 decaffeinated to keep amazed 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.939
 with the magic of chemical engineering the 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.500
 Professor RubÃ©n gave me a tour of 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.019
 the laboratories of some of their 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.659
 colleagues to show me a new series 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.430
 of experiments that are very different 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.409
 in their ends, all of them start from the same 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 element that we all have in the house the 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.310
 sugar is you know that plastics 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.109
 like these like polypropylene the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.629
 polyethylene come from the industry of 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.430
 true oil then what we 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.319
 we are trying to develop is a 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.709
 from microorganisms such as those 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.359
 we have here that you can see them here 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.489
 those microorganisms have the ability 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.250
 of accumulating a polymer so 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.829
 intracellular and that polymer 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.950
 what we do is extract it and 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.980
 form movies of this type look at these 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.170
 movies what we do is 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.909
 transform them into voice 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.890
 normal materials like the ones you 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.890
 you use naturally 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.440
 you like sugar I made up sugar 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.489
 besides food I also use it myself 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.580
 in the laboratory to produce 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.170
 medicines and how good I use 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.209
 some cells that are called cells 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.910
 Chinese ovarian hamster cho and them 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.440
 consume the sugar and produce some 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.640
 medications that are called 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.410
 antibodies that is used for the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.150
 treatment several diseases like the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.920
 cancer and muscle problems the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.410
 generation of chemical reactions to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.080
 from fungal cells bacteria and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.640
 living cells is known as 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.349
 biotechnology and one of the fields of 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.690
 most innovative engineering action 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.940
 chemistry however it is not so modern 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.980
 as it seems because the human being knows 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.799
 biotechnology for millennia 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.170
 when he learned to make bread cheese wine 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.930
 chicha and beer through processes 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.400
 artificial fermentation one of the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.989
 main fields of action of the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.720
 chemical engineering is that of the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.820
 power generation professor jaime 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 aguilar from the lubricants laboratory 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.260
 from the national university explained me 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.120
 how crude oil is the one that 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.010
 comes out of the wells transforms into the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.420
 gasoline we got at the station 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.330
 to be 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.270
 this you know what is that is raw in 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.960
 percent is oil and as you can see 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.250
 look at the oil properties and if 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.169
 lets feel supremely viscous 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.349
 Dark 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.409
 and the most interesting thing is that from here you 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.930
 You can get products with some 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:01.110
 aspects as different as is the 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.610
 gasoline the diesel solvents 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.280
 and that's why we always 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.350
 We have dedicated to studying how to do 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.150
 these separations 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.250
 my journey through the world of 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.080
 chemical engineering I finish where I 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.730
 had started in the creation of 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.220
 synthetic materials like those of the 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.200
 most of the clothes that I used for that 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.210
 I went to the polymer laboratory where I 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.400
 They explained that apart from textile fibers 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.140
 of chemical engineering is behind 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.120
 many other materials of daily use 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.040
 like for example the plastic that 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.520
 allowed 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.500
 good morning 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.289
 a polymer itself is a very molecule 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.759
 large very large which is made of 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.159
 smaller molecules that we call 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.960
 monomers for the explanation that I'm going 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.930
 to give now we have two monomers 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.009
 one is a born partner another is a pole and 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.810
 let's do what would be a 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.289
 polyurethane which is a reaction that is 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.289
 very fast 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.789
 they even have this in particular this 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.440
 polyurethane we use it a lot like 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.720
 thermal insulation in the fridge that 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.729
 you have in your house you will find that 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.380
 there are these types of polymers that are the 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.750
 that they would be performing there, that is 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.000
 they make sure the temperature is not lost 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.530
 from the inside of the fridge to the outside and 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.090
 that food is kept cold 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.500
 but also the polymers, because 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.960
 we use for many things in the 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.180
 nature the totality of clothes that you 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.490
 traes is made in polymers is sometimes 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.050
 polyester there are natural polymers like 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.419
 cotton which is also used for 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.729
 clothes the shoes that you wear 6 of 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.199
 polyurethane polyurethane soles 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.580
 one softer you want some 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.310
 different formulations but they are 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.560
 polyurethanes 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.120
 the paintings all the whole of the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.680
 paintings that we see are polymers 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.680
 dissolved in a solvent 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.860
 after my visit to the university 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.990
 national I can not see practically 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.700
 nothing that is not the result of a 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.860
 transformation process from the 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.080
 chemical engineering glass plastic 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.480
 fuels textiles 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.550
 medicines is as if the beings 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.110
 we would have built everything or 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.240
 rather, as if we had learned 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.660
 to transform everything almost by art 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.660
 magic 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:22.919
 Y 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.060
 all right 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.860
 ah
