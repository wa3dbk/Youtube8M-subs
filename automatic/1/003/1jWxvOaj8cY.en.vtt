you

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.029 

one<00:00:10.820> of<00:00:10.940> the<00:00:11.000> interesting<00:00:11.150> things<00:00:11.840> about<00:00:12.139> our

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
one of the interesting things about our

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.960 
one of the interesting things about our
limbic<00:00:13.339> brain<00:00:13.549> is<00:00:14.320> this<00:00:15.320> number<00:00:16.189> one<00:00:16.580> it

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
limbic brain is this number one it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.179 
limbic brain is this number one it
doesn't<00:00:17.630> lie<00:00:18.520> it<00:00:19.520> was<00:00:19.880> designed<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:21.160> make<00:00:22.160> us

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
doesn't lie it was designed to make us

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.109 
doesn't lie it was designed to make us
survive<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.449> because<00:00:24.439> it<00:00:24.800> does<00:00:25.039> that<00:00:25.400> it<00:00:25.670> is

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
survive and because it does that it is

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.540 
survive and because it does that it is
the<00:00:26.390> most<00:00:26.619> trustworthy<00:00:27.640> so<00:00:28.640> when<00:00:29.029> we<00:00:29.300> see<00:00:29.660> a

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
the most trustworthy so when we see a

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.360 
the most trustworthy so when we see a
reaction<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.759> something<00:00:32.360> that<00:00:32.780> happens<00:00:33.440> we

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
reaction to something that happens we

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.610 
reaction to something that happens we
tend<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.790> place<00:00:35.150> we<00:00:35.690> who<00:00:35.870> observe<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.440> world

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
tend to place we who observe the world

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.400 
tend to place we who observe the world
can<00:00:37.129> place<00:00:37.489> greater<00:00:37.940> emphasis<00:00:38.930> on<00:00:39.140> that

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
can place greater emphasis on that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.079 
can place greater emphasis on that
because<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.339> know<00:00:40.519> it<00:00:40.730> was<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.960> limbic<00:00:42.010> reaction

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
because we know it was a limbic reaction

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.899 
because we know it was a limbic reaction
somebody<00:00:44.089> pushes<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:46.070> react<00:00:46.519> to

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
somebody pushes you and you react to

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.590 
somebody pushes you and you react to
that<00:00:47.390> push<00:00:47.839> that<00:00:48.589> is<00:00:48.860> an<00:00:49.040> honest<00:00:49.580> display<00:00:50.330> now

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
that push that is an honest display now

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.829 
that push that is an honest display now
what<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.080> may<00:00:51.290> think<00:00:51.610> later<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.000> say<00:00:53.239> well

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
what you may think later and say well

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.170 
what you may think later and say well
you<00:00:54.110> know<00:00:54.170> what<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:55.189> person<00:00:55.549> is<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.909> bully

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
you know what I this person is a bully

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.240 
you know what I this person is a bully
maybe<00:00:56.629> I<00:00:56.750> should<00:00:56.989> keep<00:00:57.140> my<00:00:57.199> mouth<00:00:57.559> shut<00:00:57.619> that's

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
maybe I should keep my mouth shut that's

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.850 
maybe I should keep my mouth shut that's
different<00:00:59.030> it's<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.839> reactions<00:01:00.589> that<00:01:00.710> are

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
different it's the reactions that are

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.049 
different it's the reactions that are
most<00:01:01.250> accurate<00:01:02.650> curiously<00:01:03.650> enough<00:01:04.030> when<00:01:05.030> we

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
most accurate curiously enough when we

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.260 
most accurate curiously enough when we
look<00:01:05.540> at<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.229> human<00:01:06.650> body<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.369> we<00:01:07.670> say<00:01:07.939> all

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
look at the human body and we say all

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.620 
look at the human body and we say all
right<00:01:08.720> well<00:01:09.229> if<00:01:09.259> all<00:01:09.770> behavior<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:10.880> governed

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
right well if all behavior is governed

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.960 
right well if all behavior is governed
by<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> limbic<00:01:12.409> brain<00:01:12.439> which<00:01:13.310> part<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.850> our

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
by the limbic brain which part of our

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.030 
by the limbic brain which part of our
body<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.750> most<00:01:14.780> accurate<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:15.860> can

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
body is the most accurate that we can

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.460 
body is the most accurate that we can
look<00:01:16.280> at<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:16.760> most<00:01:17.360> people<00:01:17.780> think<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.260> the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
look at and most people think it's the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.720 
look at and most people think it's the
face<00:01:18.800> you<00:01:19.670> would<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:20.030> wrong<00:01:20.270> for<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:21.470> fact<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
face you would be wrong for in fact the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.450 
face you would be wrong for in fact the
most<00:01:22.970> accurate<00:01:23.650> truthful<00:01:24.650> part<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.070> your<00:01:25.250> body

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
most accurate truthful part of your body

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.320 
most accurate truthful part of your body
begins<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:27.050> your<00:01:27.409> feet<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.270> there's<00:01:29.270> a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
begins with your feet and there's a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.620 
begins with your feet and there's a
simple<00:01:29.930> evolutionary<00:01:30.820> reason<00:01:31.820> for<00:01:32.150> this<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
simple evolutionary reason for this and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.210 
simple evolutionary reason for this and
the<00:01:32.990> reason<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.100> as<00:01:34.760> we<00:01:35.510> evolved<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:36.409> was

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
the reason is that as we evolved it was

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.620 
the reason is that as we evolved it was
the<00:01:37.550> feet<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.840> first<00:01:39.409> had<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.250> react<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:41.300> any

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the feet that first had to react to any

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.680 
the feet that first had to react to any
threat<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.320> came<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:42.800> us<00:01:42.830> if<00:01:43.479> there<00:01:44.479> was<00:01:44.659> a

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
threat that came at us if there was a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.500 
threat that came at us if there was a
tiger<00:01:45.440> if<00:01:45.620> there<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.100> lion<00:01:46.550> if<00:01:47.000> there<00:01:47.270> was<00:01:47.450> a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
tiger if there was a lion if there was a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.290 
tiger if there was a lion if there was a
any<00:01:48.080> animal<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.800> was<00:01:49.100> predatory<00:01:49.940> and

any animal that was predatory and

any animal that was predatory and
threatened<00:01:51.080> us<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:52.270> was<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.750> feet<00:01:54.140> which

threatened us it was the feet which

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.600 
threatened us it was the feet which
first<00:01:55.280> held<00:01:56.180> us<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.600> place<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.350> kept<00:01:58.100> us<00:01:58.340> from

financial threat to you so what are
these<00:03:45.049> three<00:03:45.560> things<00:03:45.610> well<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:47.450> have<00:03:47.630> to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
these three things well we have to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.400 
these three things well we have to
recognize<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.410> number<00:03:49.070> one<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:50.870> tend<00:03:51.230> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
recognize that number one we tend to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.160 
recognize that number one we tend to
freeze<00:03:52.400> when<00:03:53.209> anything<00:03:53.780> threatens<00:03:54.680> us<00:03:56.170> number

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
freeze when anything threatens us number

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.289 
freeze when anything threatens us number
two<00:03:58.930> anything<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.170> we<00:04:00.410> don't<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:01.299> anything

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
two anything that we don't like anything

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.930 
two anything that we don't like anything
that<00:04:02.570> could<00:04:02.900> potentially<00:04:03.079> hurt<00:04:03.980> us<00:04:04.250> anything

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
that could potentially hurt us anything

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.500 
that could potentially hurt us anything
that<00:04:05.510> we<00:04:05.690> find<00:04:06.140> unappealing<00:04:07.180> we<00:04:08.180> will

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
that we find unappealing we will

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.930 
that we find unappealing we will
distance<00:04:09.470> ourselves<00:04:09.769> from<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:12.940> number

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
distance ourselves from that and number

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.120 
distance ourselves from that and number
three<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:16.220> when<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.150> fact<00:04:17.530> we<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.859> no

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
three is that when in fact we it no

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.600 
three is that when in fact we it no
longer<00:04:19.370> serves<00:04:20.060> us<00:04:20.510> well<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.900> just<00:04:21.530> freeze<00:04:22.070> or

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
longer serves us well to just freeze or

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.860 
longer serves us well to just freeze or
to<00:04:23.090> distance<00:04:23.960> ourselves<00:04:24.610> then<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:25.870> often

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
to distance ourselves then we often

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.800 
to distance ourselves then we often
