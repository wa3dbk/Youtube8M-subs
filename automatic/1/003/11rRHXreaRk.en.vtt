00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.540
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.150
 a new video at this time to the rovers 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.769
 but four and five followed before me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 some would like to start by first 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.140
 often in general say because I think 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 that in most cases really 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 just just ramsch are mostly 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.230
 nothing at all relevant completely 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 unnecessary 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.050
 Often you just want to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.720
 characters that came in a series ago 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 show something more revealing and me again 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.070
 I'm completely unnecessary and shy 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 That's why Rufers mostly sees for himself 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.649
 I really like watching the u 14 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 and it could be 15 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.890
 not the case at all 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.570
 These actually explain things to you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.390
 previously did not know and are 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.610
 actually relevant to tell the uvs 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.410
 the prehistory of lee before he to 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
 enlightenment came and how he then 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.579
 came to the enlightenment and how then 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.430
 the relationship between him and erwin 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.930
 So the leader of this was born 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.100
 enlightenment squads and that is 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 actually a really exciting one 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.360
 history and bring a the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.130
 character love actually closer in the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.170
 series you did not know exactly how 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.789
 her hand i know many found back then 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 that's one of her total 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.289
 darling characters is i found it though 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.880
 always there is something but you know 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.470
 not how that came into being at all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.300
 that's a bit grumpy 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.110
 and how he got to this extremely good one 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.720
 became a fighter 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.690
 and exactly this whole topic will be in 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.819
 the two opas 4 and 5 treated and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.580
 which is really cool we are 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.440
 know the city behind the walls 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.849
 and we will in this two rover it 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.310
 still a part of this city 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.810
 We'll meet you before that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 did not know because there is under this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.869
 city ​​is still a subsoil instead of that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.259
 so did the right thing that real 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.940
 lame 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.890
 there live and people just have it 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.959
 no money and if you want to go up 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.099
 they have to be a really expensive one 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.869
 pay the fee 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.640
 and from this city have in the series 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.500
 never experienced anything myself and it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.539
 is simply dealt with in these novas 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 and you just get one 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.590
 value added by these two Opas the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.610
 just too much too much 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.929
 rarely is the case 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.239
 Now I want to go to the en vs 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.590
 1 to 3 and I have to go there 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.090
 really say that so typical victims 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 when I do not really like them 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.469
 first is still okay tells one 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.750
 history I think that's fine 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.260
 Worth seeing but part 2 and part 3 are 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.180
 really 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.280
 not recommended so typical 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.230
 overs meißendorf as any bath 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.430
 you could luckily get into this adventure 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.470
 the tech and do not keep doing 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.110
 otherwise it would really be complete in the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.939
 pants gone but also so are part 2 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.140
 and part 3 really not really 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.940
 recommend you just take a 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.040
 few characters out and than spins 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.590
 some half-hearted story around 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.590
 around which is really unnecessary for 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.879
 an example duel and that brings 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.769
 simply no progress and me 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.329
 even find that it partially the 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.640
 characters he ridiculed 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.220
 therefore has the second and third 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.530
 Part you can leave confidently 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.079
 also plays no role for the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.090
 later sacrifice 4 and 5 complete this 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.819
 detached from each other 4 and 5 heard 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.650
 together but the complete novas before that 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.690
 completely detached from each other 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.639
 You can watch the first one 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.680
 is really good too but the ova 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.959
 54 you really have to look at yourself though 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.150
 the saviors could fansite because really 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.760
 story relevant information in it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.500
 are included and love the character 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.430
 you really clearly again 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.200
 is brought closer 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.530
 is more sympathetic and I am pleased 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.919
 just huge on the coming 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.989
 relay 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.090
 we do not know when she comes but we 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.730
 know that she will come and me 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.910
 still waiting for the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.560
 next season so that 's it now 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.750
 this video for the farce will be in the future 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.940
 not very often something comes because I 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.280
 also very very rare 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.829
 on warsaw because I just usually 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.879
 bad was here but was the 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.889
 special case 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.000
 I'm waiting forever for the next 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.870
 day and start and then wanted 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.419
 just a little bit again 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.000
 disappointed and I just got that 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.590
 so unprejudiced looked first 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.699
 sacrifice I found very good second 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.190
 Third, I really shit but found 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.659
 came the 45 unterberg properly flashed 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.609
 and then I thought okay 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.699
 I actually have to do that now 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.949
 make a video just look at it 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.659
 if the saviors could fan side and 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.609
 otherwise like to thumb because if 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.470
 I liked the video I am 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.959
 now just testing period that is 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.430
 from now on it will probably be mine 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.340
 his last video I have yet to 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.079
 planned uploaded now it can be 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.990
 that a few weeks no video comes 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.349
 but otherwise shot and up to 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.349
 next time
