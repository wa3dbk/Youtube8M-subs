you can see all the little circles flew
it<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.430> course<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:21.120> can

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
it in the back and of course you can

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.970 
it in the back and of course you can
just<00:02:21.450> cut<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> scallop<00:02:22.290> circle<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.830> they

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
just cut out a scallop circle and they

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.670 
just cut out a scallop circle and they
are<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:25.319> thought<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> was<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
are it on but I just thought it was a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.839 
are it on but I just thought it was a
really<00:02:25.890> good<00:02:26.099> way<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.459> rid<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.640> some

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
really good way to get rid of some

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.280 
really good way to get rid of some
scraps<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:27.510> punch<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.840> bunch<00:02:28.019> of<00:02:28.110> holes

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
scraps and just punch a bunch of holes

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.589 
scraps and just punch a bunch of holes
so<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.549> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> look<00:02:29.940> super<00:02:30.120> cute

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
so I think it's going to look super cute

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.520 
so I think it's going to look super cute
on<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.049> just<00:02:34.319> like<00:02:34.470> that

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.940 
do my little sentiment and I think I was
I<00:04:03.250> wanted<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:03.910> do<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> tag<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:05.080> kind<00:04:05.830> of

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
I wanted to just do a tag and kind of

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.860 
I wanted to just do a tag and kind of
hang<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.400> off<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.880> bow<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.420> don't<00:04:07.630> think

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
hang it off of the bow but I don't think

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.460 
hang it off of the bow but I don't think
that's<00:04:08.110> going<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.440> work<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:10.390> i<00:04:10.990> can<00:04:11.230> probably

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
that's going to work so i can probably

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.860 
that's going to work so i can probably
just<00:04:11.830> do<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> tag<00:04:12.400> here<00:04:13.000> with<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.210> little<00:04:13.480> button

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
just do a tag here with a little button

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.979 
just do a tag here with a little button
at<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.020> end<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.590> let's<00:04:14.800> try<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.780> okay<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:16.840> i

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
at the end so let's try that okay so i

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.180 
at the end so let's try that okay so i
went<00:04:17.140> ahead<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.410> i<00:04:17.530> heerd<00:04:17.769> my<00:04:17.920> little

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.070 
went ahead and i heerd my little
watermelon<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.209> kind<00:04:19.420> of<00:04:19.450> did<00:04:19.630> him<00:04:19.660> off<00:04:19.930> to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
watermelon and I kind of did him off to

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.360 
watermelon and I kind of did him off to
the<00:04:20.200> side<00:04:20.380> because<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.709> wanted<00:04:20.980> him<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.160> be

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
the side because I wanted him to be

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.880 
the side because I wanted him to be
flush<00:04:21.670> with<00:04:21.700> one<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> sides<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:23.650> cut

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
flush with one of the sides and I cut

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.220 
flush with one of the sides and I cut
out<00:04:24.010> my<00:04:24.160> little<00:04:24.430> tag<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.810> cut<00:04:25.990> out<00:04:26.020> at

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
out my little tag and this is cut out at

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.900 
out my little tag and this is cut out at
two<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.590> half<00:04:26.740> inches<00:04:26.980> it's<00:04:27.400> also<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:27.880> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
two and a half inches it's also from the

two and a half inches it's also from the
sentimentalist<00:04:28.780> cartridge<00:04:29.140> but<00:04:29.320> there's

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
sentimentalist cartridge but there's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.750 
sentimentalist cartridge but there's
tags<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:30.010> like<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.340> bunch<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.640> different

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.000 
tags on like a bunch of different
cartridges<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.660> I'm<00:04:32.080> thinking<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.620> just<00:04:32.800> kind

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
cartridges and I'm thinking of just kind

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.980 
cartridges and I'm thinking of just kind
of<00:04:33.130> hiding<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.520> Todd<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.180> this<00:04:34.420> underneath

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
of hiding the Todd like this underneath

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.830 
of hiding the Todd like this underneath
the<00:04:35.350> bow<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.920> then<00:04:36.760> I'm<00:04:37.120> stamping<00:04:37.570> my

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
the bow and then I'm stamping my

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.230 
the bow and then I'm stamping my
sentiment<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.530> there<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.640> forgot<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.090> tell

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
sentiment in there and I forgot to tell

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.000 
sentiment in there and I forgot to tell
you<00:04:40.300> my<00:04:40.540> little<00:04:40.720> watermelon<00:04:41.200> he's<00:04:41.590> kind<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:41.860> at

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
you my little watermelon he's kind of at

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.830 
you my little watermelon he's kind of at
two<00:04:42.220> inches<00:04:42.460> using<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.120> symbol<00:04:43.450> a<00:04:43.510> charmed

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
two inches using the symbol a charmed

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.590 
two inches using the symbol a charmed
cartridge<00:04:44.350> so<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.640> think<00:04:45.730> that's<00:04:45.970> exactly<00:04:46.420> what

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600

and one of my favorite tips went up heat

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.680 
and one of my favorite tips went up heat

ink to use for stamping and the truth is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.130 
ink to use for stamping and the truth is
that<00:06:04.640> i<00:06:04.730> don't<00:06:04.760> use<00:06:05.150> white<00:06:05.480> ink<00:06:05.780> i<00:06:05.930> rather

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
than stamping it and white because the

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.120 
than stamping it and white because the
white<00:06:11.000> will<00:06:11.180> never<00:06:11.540> at<00:06:11.840> least<00:06:12.050> a<00:06:12.200> stamp<00:06:12.470> pads

that I've use never come out right so I

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.850
