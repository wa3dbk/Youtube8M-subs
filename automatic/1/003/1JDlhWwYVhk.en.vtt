hey<00:00:07.710> guys<00:00:08.010> cue<00:00:08.519> hamster<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.210> guess<00:00:09.630> what<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
hey guys cue hamster here guess what I

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.589 
hey guys cue hamster here guess what I
made<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> new<00:00:11.519> elevator<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.179> been<00:00:12.330> many<00:00:12.509> years

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
made a new elevator it's been many years

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.060 
made a new elevator it's been many years
but<00:00:13.460> recently<00:00:14.780> Mojang<00:00:15.780> sort<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.590> did<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
but recently Mojang sort of did a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.310 
but recently Mojang sort of did a
unintentional<00:00:17.970> fix<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.630> makes<00:00:19.020> these

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
unintentional fix that makes these

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.740 
unintentional fix that makes these
old-school<00:00:19.920> elevators<00:00:20.550> work<00:00:20.789> again<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
old-school elevators work again so a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.929 
old-school elevators work again so a
couple<00:00:22.289> days<00:00:22.470> back<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.949> designed<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:23.699> from

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
couple days back I designed one from

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.929 
couple days back I designed one from
scratch<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.539> completely<00:00:25.080> from<00:00:25.260> scratch

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
scratch like completely from scratch

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.920 
scratch like completely from scratch
tried<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> different<00:00:27.480> designs<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
tried a lot of different designs and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
tried a lot of different designs and
this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.680> came<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.789> in

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this is what I came up with it is in

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
this is what I came up with it is in
functionality<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:31.679> similar<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.340> my<00:00:32.489> old

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
functionality very similar to my old

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.479 
functionality very similar to my old
design<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.980> goes<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.130> fast<00:00:37.370> it's<00:00:38.370> very

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
design so it goes up fast it's very

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.959 
design so it goes up fast it's very
noisy<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.329> has<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.719> dingdong<00:00:40.200> sounds<00:00:40.969> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
noisy it has a little dingdong sounds it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.459 
noisy it has a little dingdong sounds it
goes<00:00:42.210> down<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.660> well<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:48.050> when<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> send<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
goes down as well and when you send it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.090 
goes down as well and when you send it
up<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:53.629> it's<00:00:54.629> already<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> instant

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
up and it's already up you can instant

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.939 
up and it's already up you can instant
call<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> elevator<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.949> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
call the elevator and get it and the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.429 
call the elevator and get it and the
same<00:01:02.190> goes<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:02.910> function

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.819 

you<00:01:10.439> don't<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> wait<00:01:11.039> for<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> leg<00:01:11.880> up

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
you don't have to wait for the leg up

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:20.499 
you don't have to wait for the leg up
and<00:01:14.180> if<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> miss<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.350> just

press it and just get in miss it on the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.170 
press it and just get in miss it on the
way<00:01:24.000> down

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.030 

so<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.330> thing<00:01:33.480> is<00:01:33.600> doors<00:01:33.870> ding-dong<00:01:34.530> instant

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
so this thing is doors ding-dong instant

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.220 
so this thing is doors ding-dong instant
call<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.700> down<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.150> superfast<00:01:36.840> down<00:01:37.200> a

smooth it has everything you would want
in<00:01:39.120> an<00:01:39.420> elevator<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.980> cool<00:01:41.160> thing<00:01:41.190> is

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
in an elevator and the cool thing is

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.340 
in an elevator and the cool thing is
it's<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.910> lot<00:01:42.150> more<00:01:42.360> compact<00:01:42.840> than<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.260> original

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it's a lot more compact than my original

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.820 
it's a lot more compact than my original
designed<00:01:43.920> wiring<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.700> four<00:01:45.690> by<00:01:45.810> ten<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.350> it's

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
designed wiring is four by ten and it's

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.770 
designed wiring is four by ten and it's
like<00:01:47.010> eleven<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.460> ten<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.910> you<00:01:47.940> include<00:01:48.480> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
like eleven by ten if you include the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.430 
like eleven by ten if you include the
like<00:01:49.560> glass<00:01:49.980> blocks<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.580> need<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:52.200> prevent

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
like glass blocks you need to prevent

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.590 
like glass blocks you need to prevent
you<00:01:52.620> getting<00:01:52.770> pushed<00:01:53.100> off<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.640> platform

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you getting pushed off the platform

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
you getting pushed off the platform
that's<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:55.080> up<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> yeah<00:01:56.400> it's<00:01:56.550> super

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that's going up but yeah it's super

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.830 
that's going up but yeah it's super
compact<00:01:57.480> wiring<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:59.390> yeah<00:02:00.390> different

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
compact wiring it is a yeah different

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050 
compact wiring it is a yeah different
type<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> elevator<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.820> comparator<00:02:02.820> based

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
type of elevator it's comparator based

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.630 
type of elevator it's comparator based
elevator<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.690> haven't<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.140> seen<00:02:04.430> like<00:02:05.430> any

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
elevator I haven't really seen like any

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
elevator I haven't really seen like any
of<00:02:05.790> those<00:02:05.910> but<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> could<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.450> missed<00:02:06.660> some<00:02:07.020> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of those but I could have missed some I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.880 
of those but I could have missed some I
don't<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.470> very<00:02:07.680> compact<00:02:09.230> it<00:02:10.230> doesn't<00:02:10.530> yell

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
don't know very compact it doesn't yell

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
don't know very compact it doesn't yell
like<00:02:11.010> use<00:02:11.220> Pistons<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.880> back<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.600> mess

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
like use Pistons in the back to mess

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.320 
like use Pistons in the back to mess
around<00:02:13.620> with<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.070> instant<00:02:14.670> calling<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.240> with

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
around with the instant calling and with

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.650 
around with the instant calling and with
down<00:02:15.600> down<00:02:16.410> sequence<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.420> less

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
down down sequence so that's it less

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.710 
down down sequence so that's it less
Lloyd<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.560> less<00:02:19.830> noisy<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.640> less<00:02:20.940> laggy<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
Lloyd it's less noisy and less laggy and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.170 
Lloyd it's less noisy and less laggy and
the<00:02:22.590> cool<00:02:22.770> thing<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.310> built<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the cool thing is I built this on the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.510 
the cool thing is I built this on the
cube<00:02:24.510> crowd<00:02:24.780> net<00:02:25.350> server<00:02:25.650> IP<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
cube crowd net server IP in the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.520 
cube crowd net server IP in the
description<00:02:27.060> which<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.050> buckets<00:02:28.440> like

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
description which is a buckets like

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.010 
description which is a buckets like
online<00:02:28.830> bucket<00:02:29.280> server<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.630> never

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
online bucket server and I have never

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.810 
online bucket server and I have never
managed<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.710> get<00:02:31.800> stuck<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> elevator<00:02:32.670> on

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
managed to get stuck in the elevator on

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.340 
managed to get stuck in the elevator on
the<00:02:32.940> way<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.390> I've<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> bigger<00:02:34.080> design

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the way up like I've got a bigger design

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.410 
the way up like I've got a bigger design
here<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.920> test<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.180> never

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
here that we can test but I have never

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.820 
here that we can test but I have never
gotten<00:02:36.660> stuck<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.050> it

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
gotten stuck in it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370 
gotten stuck in it
both<00:02:38.250> single-player<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.030> multiplayer<00:02:39.380> has

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
both single-player and multiplayer has

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.899 
both single-player and multiplayer has
always<00:02:40.680> work

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.600 

100%<00:02:44.599> reliably<00:02:45.319> for<00:02:45.709> me<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.069> one<00:02:46.220> point<00:02:46.400> eight

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
100% reliably for me in one point eight

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.059 
100% reliably for me in one point eight
point<00:02:46.879> seven<00:02:47.290> which<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.409> where<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.590> built<00:02:48.890> this

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
point seven which is where I built this

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.619 
point seven which is where I built this
or<00:02:49.310> one<00:02:49.459> point<00:02:49.670> eight<00:02:49.730> point<00:02:49.940> six<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.390> don't

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
or one point eight point six I don't

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.710 
or one point eight point six I don't
know<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:52.040> yeah<00:02:52.159> super<00:02:52.819> reliable<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.420> have

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
know but yeah super reliable I have

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
know but yeah super reliable I have
however<00:02:53.959> seen<00:02:54.230> other<00:02:54.680> people<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:55.129> stuck<00:02:55.370> in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
however seen other people get stuck in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.130 
however seen other people get stuck in
this<00:02:55.640> design<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.269> have<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> say<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.870> like

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
this design like I have to say this like

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.259 
this design like I have to say this like
on<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> cube<00:02:58.010> route<00:02:58.129> server<00:02:58.459> if<00:02:58.790> you

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
on the on the cube route server if you

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.670 
on the on the cube route server if you
have<00:02:59.360> like<00:02:59.569> a<00:02:59.599> very<00:02:59.690> leggy<00:03:00.200> internet

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
have like a very leggy internet

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.380 
have like a very leggy internet
connection<00:03:01.220> there<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.849> chance<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.299> get

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
connection there is a chance to get

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.289 
connection there is a chance to get
stuck<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.989> an<00:03:03.590> elevator<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.400> one<00:03:04.580> but

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
stuck in an elevator like this one but

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.789 
stuck in an elevator like this one but
if<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> good<00:03:05.750> computer<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.650> good

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
if you have a good computer and a good

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.199 
if you have a good computer and a good
internet<00:03:07.069> connection<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.700> thing<00:03:07.879> is<00:03:07.970> one

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
internet connection this thing is one

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.199 
internet connection this thing is one
option<00:03:08.360> reliable<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> thing<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:10.549> this

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
option reliable so the thing is this

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.650 
option reliable so the thing is this
thing<00:03:11.420> will<00:03:11.569> be<00:03:12.129> downloadable<00:03:13.510> download<00:03:14.510> link

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
thing will be downloadable download link

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.509 
thing will be downloadable download link
will<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.079> description<00:03:15.620> as<00:03:15.769> well<00:03:16.160> as<00:03:16.430> a

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
will be in the description as well as a

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.160 
will be in the description as well as a
schematic<00:03:16.819> as<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.329> can<00:03:17.450> see<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:17.900> not

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
schematic as you can see it's not

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.050 
schematic as you can see it's not
directional<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:18.950> can<00:03:19.069> place<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.489> orientate

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
directional you can place it orientate

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.319 
directional you can place it orientate
it<00:03:20.209> however<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.720> want<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:22.090> seeing<00:03:23.090> as<00:03:23.209> the

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
it however you want and seeing as the

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.229 
it however you want and seeing as the
wiring<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.049> although<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.829> complex<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.760> is

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
wiring is although it's complex it is

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.110 
wiring is although it's complex it is
kind<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.200> repetitive<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.890> tried<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.670> color<00:03:28.849> code

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
kind of repetitive I tried to color code

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.869 
kind of repetitive I tried to color code
the<00:03:29.390> circuits<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.410> best<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.799> can<00:03:30.859> as<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:31.760> can

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
the circuits the best I can as you can

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.970 
the circuits the best I can as you can
see<00:03:32.060> it's<00:03:32.390> it's<00:03:32.900> compact<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:33.739> very

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
see it's it's compact and it's very

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.770 
see it's it's compact and it's very
repetitive<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.090> can<00:03:35.390> actually<00:03:35.540> do<00:03:35.750> a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
repetitive so I can actually do a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.599 
repetitive so I can actually do a
tutorial<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.349> this<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:36.859> let's<00:03:37.040> say<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:37.459> this

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
tutorial on this so let's say if this

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.839 
tutorial on this so let's say if this
video<00:03:37.879> gets<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.450> 600<00:03:39.109> likes<00:03:39.319> or<00:03:39.620> more<00:03:39.859> I'll

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
video gets like 600 likes or more I'll

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.970 
video gets like 600 likes or more I'll
do<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> tutorial<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.870> think<00:03:42.379> that<00:03:42.500> seems<00:03:42.769> like

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
do a tutorial I think that seems like

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.900 
do a tutorial I think that seems like
reasonable<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.470> yeah<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:46.069> you<00:03:46.489> guys<00:03:46.579> enjoy
