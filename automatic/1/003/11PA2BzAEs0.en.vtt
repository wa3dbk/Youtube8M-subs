00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.879
 difficult and in the end that this incredible 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.610
 city two years ago was devastated by 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.670
 an earthquake but it has undoubtedly returned to 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.800
 be reborn more strongly than ever before 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.650
 francisco reminds me that when there 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.540
 difficulties do not have to surrender 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.820
 that you have to use them as a 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.420
 opportunity to grow sometimes 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.210
 we will be down other times above but 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.850
 remember that we can always rebuild 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.799
 our lives so let's train 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 today with the same spirit that is breathed 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.229
 in San Francisco 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.810
 today we will work the hips to 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.970
 reduce standing with legs 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.610
 we turn our feet slightly 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.280
 to the left we place the arms 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.290
 at a 90 degree angle and we raise the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.750
 right leg at hip height 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.450
 the exercise consists of going up and down 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.210
 the leg quickly for 30 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.640
 seconds later we will repeat it with the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.899
 left leg and we will do three series 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.899
 of these two movements 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.540
 right leg we start 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.650

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.060
 we just finished the first series 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.970
 but we still have to make two more 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.020
 so click on this window to continue 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.020
 training together 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.719
 and to reduce the fat of the hips 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.450
 Here I tell you what foods are going to you 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.680
 the spinach the citrus the beet 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.139

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.510
 keep training more exercises and

 I say goodbye but remember the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.930
 difficulties are opportunities for 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.930
 grow
