professional 41 millimeter quartz
Edition<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:12.440> believe<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> 2008<00:00:14.370> model<00:00:14.429> with

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
Edition I believe it's a 2008 model with

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.279 
Edition I believe it's a 2008 model with
the<00:00:15.269> most<00:00:15.450> obvious<00:00:17.449> improvements<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the most obvious improvements in the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.400 
the most obvious improvements in the
newer<00:00:19.470> models<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.550> raised<00:00:20.760> indices<00:00:21.410> as

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
newer models are the raised indices as

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
newer models are the raised indices as
you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:23.119> much<00:00:24.119> better<00:00:24.689> I'll<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.990> because

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you can see much better I'll do because

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.359 
you can see much better I'll do because

it's a really robust simple go to a

it's a really robust simple go to a

automatic<00:00:53.340> model<00:00:54.890> true<00:00:55.890> classic<00:00:56.370> yeah<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.449> went

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
automatic model true classic yeah I went

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.549 
automatic model true classic yeah I went
to<00:00:58.020> Japan<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.590> holidays<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.559> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to Japan on holidays with this and it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
to Japan on holidays with this and it
was<00:01:01.680> great<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.489> great<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.180> really

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
was great it was great it was a really

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.870 
was great it was great it was a really
nice<00:01:03.600> time<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.049> bond<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.729> a<00:01:05.729> watch<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:07.880> believe

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
nice time to bond with a watch I believe

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
nice time to bond with a watch I believe
it's<00:01:09.030> only<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.270> single<00:01:09.659> coat<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.979> similar

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it's only a single coat a are so similar

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
it's only a single coat a are so similar
to<00:01:11.369> my<00:01:11.610> other<00:01:11.729> Rolex<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.200> occasionally

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to my other Rolex where you occasionally

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
to my other Rolex where you occasionally
would<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:15.049> significant<00:01:16.049> reflection<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
would get a significant reflection of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.270 
would get a significant reflection of
light<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:18.650> overall<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
light as you can see now overall the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.300 
light as you can see now overall the
doll<00:01:20.490> clarity<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.299> nice<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
doll clarity is really nice and the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.840 
doll clarity is really nice and the
luminescence<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:26.280> accuracy<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:27.650> stunning

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
luminescence is the accuracy is stunning

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.749 
luminescence is the accuracy is stunning
as<00:01:29.850> you'd<00:01:30.060> expect<00:01:30.420> from<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.659> quartz<00:01:31.759> but

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
as you'd expect from a quartz but

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.289 
as you'd expect from a quartz but
accuracy<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:34.049> value<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:35.299> rotate

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
accuracy I don't value so much I rotate

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.539 
accuracy I don't value so much I rotate
my<00:01:36.329> watches<00:01:36.750> often<00:01:37.049> enough<00:01:40.520> looks<00:01:41.520> good<00:01:41.729> on

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
my watches often enough looks good on

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.960 
my watches often enough looks good on
NATO<00:01:44.720> only<00:01:45.720> select<00:01:46.140> few<00:01:46.439> NATO's<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.070> reckon<00:01:47.640> but

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
NATO only select few NATO's I reckon but

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.719 
NATO only select few NATO's I reckon but
I<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> classic<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.430> would

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I think the classic look for this would

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
I think the classic look for this would
be<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> bracelet<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.259> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
be on the bracelet as you see here in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
be on the bracelet as you see here in
this<00:01:52.920> configuration<00:01:53.390> which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> great

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this configuration which is a great

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.670 
this configuration which is a great
bracelet<00:01:55.229> -<00:01:57.020> very<00:01:58.020> comfortable

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
bracelet - very comfortable

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
bracelet - very comfortable
I<00:01:59.869> think<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:02.070> contributed<00:02:02.729> by

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I think it's that that's contributed by

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.140 
I think it's that that's contributed by
the<00:02:03.119> link<00:02:04.079> design<00:02:04.610> very<00:02:05.610> minimal<00:02:07.099> pinching

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.860 

good<00:02:13.150> robust<00:02:13.540> class

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:30.050 

I'm<00:02:19.440> at<00:02:19.590> random<00:02:20.040> shot

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.340 

and<00:02:31.060> that's<00:02:31.240> just<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.600> few<00:02:31.810> seconds<00:02:32.200> under

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
and that's just for a few seconds under

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.530 
and that's just for a few seconds under
the<00:02:32.590> lamp<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> decent<00:02:36.100> charge<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:37.300> will

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
the lamp on a decent charge it will

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.370 
the lamp on a decent charge it will
remain<00:02:37.840> legible<00:02:38.550> throughout<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.670> night

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
remain legible throughout the night

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.410 
remain legible throughout the night
that's<00:02:41.380> my<00:02:41.560> measure<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.250> Noom<00:02:43.060> longevity<00:02:45.420> if

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that's my measure of Noom longevity if

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.930 
that's my measure of Noom longevity if
it<00:02:46.660> goes<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.110> night<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.130> wake<00:02:48.340> up<00:02:48.400> in

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
it goes for the night and you wake up in

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.240 
it goes for the night and you wake up in
the<00:02:49.180> stock<00:02:49.450> either<00:02:49.810> still<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.920> it's<00:02:51.070> still

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the stock either still and it's still

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.510 
the stock either still and it's still
legible<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.790> call<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.660> decent<00:02:52.840> new

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
legible I call that decent new

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.620 
legible I call that decent new
brightness<00:02:54.520> is<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.820> thing<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:55.240> how<00:02:55.450> long

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
brightness is one thing but how long

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.170 
brightness is one thing but how long
does<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.780> last

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
does it last

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.690 
does it last
yeah<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.920> believe<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.070> Loom<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.550> is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
yeah I believe the Loom on this is

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.540 
yeah I believe the Loom on this is
better<00:03:00.910> than<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.570> my<00:03:01.750> planet<00:03:01.960> ocean<00:03:02.460> which<00:03:03.460> I

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
better than on my planet ocean which I

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.310 
better than on my planet ocean which I
sold<00:03:03.850> actually<00:03:06.630> really<00:03:07.630> good<00:03:07.810> really<00:03:08.230> good

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
sold actually really good really good
