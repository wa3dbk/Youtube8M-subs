00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.730
 to french higuain kernilis and his brother 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.809
 have been producing milk for some 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.610
 years they changed their practices 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.420
 by dividing their flocks into two lots 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.519
 dairy cows 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.650
 the lots are made up according to 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.369
 production and stage of lactation 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.320
 cows 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.880
 two reasons for driving in two 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.619
 lots of buildings too cramped for 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.450
 welcome the entire flock a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.310
 rationalization of forage portions 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.680
 following the soaring price of materials 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.840
 first the lot at as it's called 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.880
 here for us it's the lot of cows and 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.370
 fresh calves and up to 160 days of 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.300
 creation and on the other side we have the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.010
 lot board that is alert now 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.390
 so it's fabrications since 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.739
 cows that do not have the potential to 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 production to justify what they are 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.539
 then gives for a purpose of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.840
 of economy and profitability we 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.790
 wanted to work in two batches the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.110
 reorganization of the building allowed us 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.710
 to do what we wanted to do 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.629
 since a long time 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 that is, work in two batches on 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.100
 lot or justify a more diet 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.890
 rich and more of the aubrac and brings it back 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 by pretending we are simplifying 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.950
 all earth and winter feeding 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 also we distribute first roll so 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.240
 down as we call it home and end 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 of lactation and after enr complement of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.500
 the mixer for the top and one 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
 illustrious moved that we must play and the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.789
 to have closed any building also one 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.080
 has more parasites in the building 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.590
 that is, we removed the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.220
 starlings before it was the galley 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 because we were distributing from memory five 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.430
 times a day 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.180
 the relationship to cows to prevent that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.530
 are not polluted by the waters 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.759
 a single distribution instead of five 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.960
 previously the hughes brothers a 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.970
 optimize their working time 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.409
 other time saving the cleaning of the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.520
 stabling and the acquisition of a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.649
 automatic scrapers 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.350
 this time by 24 hours the machine 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.970
 cleans the soil before farmers 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.039
 spent over an hour and a half washing the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.289
 stabling today in half 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.610
 time is done and that without disturbing 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.160
 the foot herd yeah because we have 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.500
 put the cubicle hackers on my white 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 with scrapers so in this part 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.280
 there the manual intervention is limited to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.640
 pass the racket at the back of 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.750
 cubicles twice in the water that's all 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.319
 we had no difficulty since 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.239
 their actors stop as soon as a cow 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.010
 are stationing against their actors there 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.360
 stops he could not tear it off to pass 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.269
 by thriller scrapers he resumes his 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.190
 is that normally it's a 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.870
 very gentle operation other 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 innovation the pooling of resources 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.310
 with the neighboring pig farm 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 following the construction of a lagoon 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.019
 the two farms exchange their 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.820
 effluents and everyone is there 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.220
 agronomically that we slurry it from 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.170
 beaurains was not interesting for 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.480
 we in our system against that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.780
 each other poor and more 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.160
 interesting for us the slurry port 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.440
 is complementary to cattle manure 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.209
 since the zot of a visit would have said 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.329
 what we are faster than the area 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.420
 manure so for startup and 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.069
 culture it was more interesting 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.020
 we dominated pau and the zippo we 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.300
 can also value on surfaces 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.830
 in grass thing that the usaid brews the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.140
 surface in r it's very difficult to 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.670
 put in the beginning of 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.459
 two campaigns but we only 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.720
 independent saying that 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.400
 agronomically for us it was 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.170
 interesting to have plants and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 finally last technical innovations 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.840
 this time the establishment of a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.880
 electric dog in the milking parlor 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.740
 no need to run after flock the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.000
 curtain deals with it here a lot of 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.560
 novelties that allow 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.360
 operators optimize their time of 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.260
 work to fully focus 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.260
 on the production side
