would you agree Madden still trails 2k
in<00:01:53.330> certain<00:01:53.630> areas<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:55.729> answer<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.179> is

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
in certain areas the answer to that is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.040 
in certain areas the answer to that is
yes<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.429> think<00:01:58.490> Madden<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> lot<00:01:59.810> better

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
yes and I think Madden is a lot better

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.950 
yes and I think Madden is a lot better
than<00:02:00.110> 2k<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.920> lot<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.250> other<00:02:01.399> areas<00:02:01.960> what

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
than 2k and a lot of other areas what

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.940 
than 2k and a lot of other areas what
improvements<00:02:03.259> do<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.500> think<00:02:03.679> are<00:02:03.800> most

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
improvements do you think are most

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.540 
improvements do you think are most
overlooked<00:02:04.369> by<00:02:04.520> gamers<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:07.039> this<00:02:07.429> is

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
overlooked by gamers so this is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.509 
overlooked by gamers so this is
interesting<00:02:07.789> I<00:02:08.800> actually<00:02:09.800> don't<00:02:10.130> think<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
interesting I actually don't think the

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.820 
interesting I actually don't think the
improvements<00:02:11.060> are<00:02:11.120> overlooked<00:02:11.570> by<00:02:11.810> most<00:02:12.650> of

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
improvements are overlooked by most of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.949 
improvements are overlooked by most of
the<00:02:12.890> Madden<00:02:13.280> core<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.850> think<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.420> Madden<00:02:14.720> core

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
the Madden core I think the Madden core

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.420 
the Madden core I think the Madden core
appreciates<00:02:15.560> everything<00:02:15.830> we've<00:02:16.100> done<00:02:16.280> over

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
appreciates everything we've done over

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.850 
appreciates everything we've done over
the<00:02:16.550> past<00:02:16.640> three<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.180> four<00:02:17.209> years<00:02:17.630> since<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the past three to four years since you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860 
the past three to four years since you
know<00:02:18.980> cams<00:02:19.310> reign<00:02:19.730> has<00:02:19.970> kind<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.239> started<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
know cams reign has kind of started and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.259 
know cams reign has kind of started and
Clint<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.680> been<00:02:21.829> on<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.070> team<00:02:22.269> kind

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
Clint and I have been on the team kind

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.759 
Clint and I have been on the team kind
of<00:02:23.329> taking<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.660> different<00:02:23.930> direction<00:02:24.019> and

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
of taking in a different direction and

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.110 
of taking in a different direction and
it's<00:02:24.860> taken<00:02:25.100> us<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.280> few<00:02:25.459> years<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.760> get<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> this

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
it's taken us a few years to get to this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.819 
it's taken us a few years to get to this
authentic<00:02:26.600> simulation<00:02:27.140> model<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.560> we<00:02:27.650> want

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
authentic simulation model that we want

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.610 
authentic simulation model that we want
it<00:02:28.630> but<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> think<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.019> main<00:02:30.200> thing<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.500> gets

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
it but I think the main thing that gets

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.199 
it but I think the main thing that gets
overlooked<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.280> people<00:02:31.610> who<00:02:31.730> haven't<00:02:32.060> played

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
overlooked is people who haven't played

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.970 
overlooked is people who haven't played
or<00:02:32.540> bought<00:02:32.750> Madden<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.260> long<00:02:33.440> time<00:02:33.470> still

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
or bought Madden that a long time still

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.520 
or bought Madden that a long time still
assume<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.329> a<00:02:35.390> crap<00:02:35.570> game<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.290> think

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
assume that it's a crap game and I think

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.720 
assume that it's a crap game and I think
that<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.890> mistake<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.519> if<00:02:37.579> they

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
that that's a mistake and if they

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
that that's a mistake and if they
actually<00:02:38.030> went<00:02:38.390> out<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.660> played<00:02:38.810> Madden<00:02:39.200> 15

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
actually went out and played Madden 15

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.830 
actually went out and played Madden 15
or<00:02:40.160> Madden<00:02:40.549> 16<00:02:41.000> they<00:02:41.209> would<00:02:41.329> feel<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.720> wow

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
or Madden 16 they would feel like wow

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.360 
or Madden 16 they would feel like wow
this<00:02:42.049> game<00:02:42.230> has<00:02:42.410> really<00:02:42.650> come<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> long<00:02:43.040> way<00:02:43.340> in

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
this game has really come a long way in

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.160 
this game has really come a long way in
the<00:02:43.519> last<00:02:43.549> couple<00:02:43.880> years<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.450> if<00:02:44.959> you're<00:02:45.049> one

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the last couple years so if you're one

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.060 
the last couple years so if you're one
of<00:02:45.260> those<00:02:45.320> people<00:02:45.380> give<00:02:46.160> us<00:02:46.220> another<00:02:46.370> chance

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
of those people give us another chance

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.960 
of those people give us another chance
let's<00:02:49.070> say<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.310> have<00:02:49.430> unlimited<00:02:49.670> resources

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
let's say you have unlimited resources

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.080 
let's say you have unlimited resources
oh<00:02:50.570> my<00:02:50.780> god<00:02:50.959> if<00:02:51.140> only<00:02:51.340> what<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.459> most<00:02:52.730> what

oh my god if only what is the most what
is<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.329> one<00:02:53.720> area<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.110> personally<00:02:54.620> would

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
is the one area you personally would

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.650 
is the one area you personally would
focus<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.250> most<00:02:55.430> well<00:02:55.640> resources<00:02:56.510> don't

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
focus on the most well resources don't

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.599 
focus on the most well resources don't
change<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.650> number<00:02:57.890> one<00:02:58.010> thing<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.459> want

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
change the number one thing that I want

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.160 
change the number one thing that I want
to<00:02:58.640> focus<00:02:58.940> on<00:02:59.090> which<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.299> authentic<00:02:59.840> football

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
to focus on which is authentic football

to focus on which is authentic football
simulation<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.040> we're<00:03:01.130> not<00:03:01.220> there<00:03:01.430> yet<00:03:01.609> we're

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
simulation and we're not there yet we're

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.060 
simulation and we're not there yet we're
pushing<00:03:02.810> towards<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.380> goal<00:03:03.560> we're<00:03:03.859> getting

pushing towards that goal we're getting

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.319 
pushing towards that goal we're getting
closer<00:03:04.280> every<00:03:04.430> year<00:03:04.790> but<00:03:04.940> we're<00:03:05.060> not<00:03:05.180> there

closer every year but we're not there

closer every year but we're not there
yet<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.260> other<00:03:06.350> thing<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.799> would<00:03:06.890> bring

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
yet the other thing that I would bring

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.090 
yet the other thing that I would bring
up<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.430> animation<00:03:07.970> quality<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.440> inherited

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
up is animation quality what I inherited

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.460 
up is animation quality what I inherited
as<00:03:10.370> creative<00:03:10.700> director<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:11.269> game<00:03:11.480> play<00:03:11.720> was<00:03:12.320> an

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
animation system that at times is

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.400 
animation system that at times is
wonderful<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.810> at<00:03:14.900> times<00:03:15.109> is<00:03:15.260> really

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
wonderful and at times is really

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.580 
wonderful and at times is really
problematic

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
problematic

priority number one for me and making

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.660 
priority number one for me and making
sure<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.680> game<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.040> motion<00:03:26.400> looks<00:03:26.550> as
