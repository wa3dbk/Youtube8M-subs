year one time I drank an ayahuasca was
trying<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.830> show<00:01:07.070> me<00:01:07.310> how<00:01:07.759> to<00:01:08.479> live<00:01:08.780> underneath

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.819 

they<00:01:14.439> say<00:01:14.680> this<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:14.950> possible<00:01:15.640> but<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:17.320> Western

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
they say this is possible but my Western

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.310 
they say this is possible but my Western
culture<00:01:18.369> irrational<00:01:19.030> mind<00:01:21.869> wants<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.020> believe

culture irrational mind wants to believe
this<00:01:23.619> but<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.039> won't<00:01:24.250> give<00:01:25.030> in<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.450> this<00:01:25.570> theory

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
this but it won't give in to this theory

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.880 
this but it won't give in to this theory
completely<00:01:27.479> such<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.509> human<00:01:28.810> human<00:01:29.439> body<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:29.770> to

protect itself and the human body knows
by<00:01:33.820> internet<00:01:34.210> water<00:01:34.450> now<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.439> don't<00:01:35.590> come<00:01:35.770> up

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
by internet water now I don't come up

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
by internet water now I don't come up
for<00:01:35.920> air<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.189> little<00:01:36.399> while<00:01:36.579> I'm<00:01:36.759> gonna<00:01:37.030> drown

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.990 

but<00:01:40.659> it<00:01:40.810> was<00:01:40.899> showing<00:01:41.229> me<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.000> can

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
but it was showing me that you can

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.240 
but it was showing me that you can
actually<00:01:43.509> learn<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:44.049> breathe<00:01:44.380> underneath<00:01:45.039> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
actually learn to breathe underneath the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.050 
actually learn to breathe underneath the
water<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.920> don't<00:01:48.190> have<00:01:48.459> gills<00:01:48.819> like<00:01:49.179> fish

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.230 

but<00:01:53.689> it<00:01:53.810> didn't<00:01:54.079> completely<00:01:54.439> show<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.340> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
but it didn't completely show and I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.889 
but it didn't completely show and I
didn't<00:01:56.780> completely<00:01:57.290> buy<00:01:57.530> into<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.899> wanted

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
didn't completely buy into it I wanted

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.490 
didn't completely buy into it I wanted
to<00:02:02.439> but

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.240 

I<00:02:06.530> think<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.370> lot<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.910> things<00:02:08.210> that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I think a lot of the things that

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.490 
I think a lot of the things that
actually<00:02:10.250> Carlos<00:02:10.880> Castenada<00:02:11.780> talked<00:02:12.080> about

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
actually Carlos Castenada talked about

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.400 
actually Carlos Castenada talked about
was<00:02:12.860> probably<00:02:13.820> when<00:02:14.120> he<00:02:14.150> was<00:02:14.540> under<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
was probably when he was under the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.650 
was probably when he was under the
influence<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.600> peyote<00:02:17.600> or<00:02:18.260> mushrooms<00:02:19.070> or<00:02:19.660> or

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
influence of peyote or mushrooms or or

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.880 
influence of peyote or mushrooms or or
the<00:02:20.900> cateura<00:02:25.780> maybe<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:27.050> actually<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.710> his

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the cateura maybe not actually in his

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.910 
the cateura maybe not actually in his
physical<00:02:28.460> body<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.480> doing<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.470> lot<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.680> these

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
physical body of doing a lot of these

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:42.130 
physical body of doing a lot of these
things<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.810> spiritual<00:02:33.440> realm<00:02:36.640> but

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.530 

whatever<00:02:42.980> Carlos<00:02:43.490> Castaneda<00:02:44.150> did<00:02:45.430> he

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
whatever Carlos Castaneda did he

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.460 
whatever Carlos Castaneda did he
inspired<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.840> lot<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.080> people<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:50.600> seek<00:02:51.050> other

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
inspired a lot of people to seek other

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.740 
inspired a lot of people to seek other
things<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.220> their<00:02:52.400> life<00:02:55.030> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
things in their life so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.530 
things in their life so
but<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.560> think<00:02:59.070> he<00:02:59.520> accomplished<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.330> lot<00:03:00.360> of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
but I I think he accomplished a lot of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.950 
but I I think he accomplished a lot of
things<00:03:01.640> through<00:03:02.640> his<00:03:02.820> work<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.060> Don<00:03:03.420> wanting

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
things through his work with Don wanting

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.750 
things through his work with Don wanting

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
dreams and I have had some rare

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.090 
dreams and I have had some rare
occasions<00:03:27.300> myself<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.470> they're<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:28.860> very

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
occasions myself that they're not very

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.500 
occasions myself that they're not very
frequent<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.670> dreaming<00:03:36.030> body<00:03:36.239> is

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
frequent so I think the dreaming body is

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.640 
frequent so I think the dreaming body is
just<00:03:37.110> as<00:03:37.260> powerful<00:03:37.470> as<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.010> physical<00:03:38.459> body
