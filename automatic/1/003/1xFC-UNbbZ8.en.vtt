which<00:00:38.229> to<00:00:39.039> me<00:00:39.159> I<00:00:39.190> know<00:00:39.370> for<00:00:39.909> you<00:00:40.030> long<00:00:40.390> term<00:00:40.600> a

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
which to me I know for you long term a

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.160 
which to me I know for you long term a
long<00:00:42.039> time<00:00:42.249> boat<00:00:42.429> guys<00:00:42.929> you<00:00:43.929> know<00:00:43.989> that's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
long time boat guys you know that's

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.860 
long time boat guys you know that's
normal<00:00:44.319> but<00:00:44.679> me<00:00:45.190> coming<00:00:45.489> from<00:00:45.579> ground<00:00:45.909> it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
normal but me coming from ground it

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.979 
normal but me coming from ground it
seems<00:00:47.519> that<00:00:48.519> it<00:00:48.699> would<00:00:48.940> be<00:00:49.179> boasting

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
seems that it would be boasting

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.319 
seems that it would be boasting
water-resistant<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:50.949> mean<00:00:51.159> it<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.429> boat<00:00:51.670> but

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
water-resistant I mean it is a boat but

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.139 
water-resistant I mean it is a boat but
it's<00:00:52.449> got<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.659> offset<00:00:53.019> rudder<00:00:53.260> system<00:00:53.499> and<00:00:53.979> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's got the offset rudder system and a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.459 
it's got the offset rudder system and a
brushless<00:00:55.149> like<00:00:55.749> I<00:00:55.870> talked<00:00:56.079> about<00:00:56.139> brushless

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
brushless like I talked about brushless

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.229 
brushless like I talked about brushless
motor<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:56.979> the<00:00:57.039> ESC<00:00:57.399> is<00:00:57.459> programmable<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.179> you

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
motor and the ESC is programmable so you

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.930 
motor and the ESC is programmable so you
can<00:00:58.389> actually<00:00:58.510> run<00:00:58.749> nickel<00:00:59.049> metal<00:00:59.139> or<00:00:59.940> lithium

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940

which is also branded Pro boat I'm
assuming<00:04:05.080> that's<00:04:05.230> manufactured<00:04:05.890> by<00:04:06.040> someone

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
assuming that's manufactured by someone

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.520 
assuming that's manufactured by someone
else<00:04:06.460> but<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.730> couldn't<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.270> sure<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:08.470> a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
else but I couldn't be sure it's a

else but I couldn't be sure it's a
digital<00:04:08.680> servo<00:04:09.270> you'll<00:04:10.270> see<00:04:10.510> there's<00:04:11.470> not<00:04:11.590> a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
digital servo you'll see there's not a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.590 
digital servo you'll see there's not a
lot<00:04:11.830> going<00:04:11.860> on<00:04:12.190> in<00:04:12.370> there<00:04:12.460> really<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.360> believe

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
lot going on in there really I believe

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.720 
lot going on in there really I believe
that<00:04:13.960> you<00:04:14.380> just<00:04:14.560> kind<00:04:14.710> of<00:04:14.860> got<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.190> fibreglass

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
that you just kind of got the fibreglass

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.729 
that you just kind of got the fibreglass
and<00:04:15.760> then<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.299> wood<00:04:16.510> kind<00:04:17.200> of<00:04:17.320> like<00:04:17.440> pine

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
and then the wood kind of like pine

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.580 
and then the wood kind of like pine
board<00:04:18.070> where<00:04:18.790> it's<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:20.049> design<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.470> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
board where it's it's the design on the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.050 
board where it's it's the design on the
bottom<00:04:20.739> helps<00:04:21.250> make<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.580> thing<00:04:21.790> really

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
bottom helps make this thing really

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.740 
bottom helps make this thing really
controllable<00:04:22.780> at<00:04:22.900> speed<00:04:24.180> we'll<00:04:25.180> see<00:04:25.420> if<00:04:25.540> it

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
controllable at speed we'll see if it

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.270 
controllable at speed we'll see if it
has<00:04:25.990> any<00:04:26.140> problems<00:04:26.530> with<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.680> chime<00:04:26.860> walking

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
has any problems with the chime walking

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.590 
has any problems with the chime walking
or<00:04:27.400> things<00:04:27.610> like<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.790> it<00:04:28.120> definitely<00:04:28.450> looks

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
or things like that it definitely looks

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.230 
or things like that it definitely looks
more<00:04:28.840> aggressive<00:04:28.960> in<00:04:29.470> its<00:04:29.620> design<00:04:29.980> than<00:04:30.760> what

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
more aggressive in its design than what

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.090 
more aggressive in its design than what
I'm<00:04:31.390> used<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.720> with<00:04:32.020> something<00:04:32.380> like<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.710> trex<00:04:33.010> a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
I'm used to with something like a trex a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.520 
I'm used to with something like a trex a
Spartan<00:04:33.490> which<00:04:33.610> looks<00:04:34.480> very<00:04:34.600> similar<00:04:34.870> it's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
Spartan which looks very similar it's

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.740 
Spartan which looks very similar it's
just<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.800> little<00:04:36.010> bit<00:04:36.100> bigger<00:04:36.310> than<00:04:36.490> this<00:04:36.750> but

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
just a little bit bigger than this but

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.090 
just a little bit bigger than this but
this<00:04:37.900> is<00:04:38.050> going<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.320> be<00:04:38.440> what<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.800> get<00:04:38.980> with

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
this is going to be what you get with

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.330 
this is going to be what you get with
the<00:04:39.190> deep<00:04:39.400> V<00:04:39.580> design<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:41.260> that's<00:04:42.040> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the deep V design so that's the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.360 
the deep V design so that's the
Widowmaker<00:04:42.610> 22<00:04:43.240> by<00:04:43.450> Pro<00:04:43.690> boat<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:45.250> you
