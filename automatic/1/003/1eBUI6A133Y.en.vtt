00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.640
 Welcome to our first session Let's play HEX! 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.760
 Through our videos, we will introduce our brand new MMO Trading Card 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.849
 to help you get started in the game. Today we will see together 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.119
 the first steps in the game, the resources and the different phases of a match. 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.759
 We are here in the lobby. By clicking on Proving Grounds, 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.189
 you access the matches. On the training grounds, you can 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.440
 play a match against another player or against the computer. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.340
 Today, we will compete with the computer. The card deck is a key element of HEX. 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.960
 This is a set of cards that serves you to fight your opponents. 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.059
 To start playing right now, let's take one of the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.230
 4 launch decks to choose from: Dwarves, Humans, Orcs or Shin'hare. 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.149
 This is the Shin'hare deck that we will choose for our test match. 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.380
 But all the starting decks are adapted when you start for the first time. 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.170
 At the beginning of the match, a play is launched to find out who is starting. 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 Luck is here in our favor and so we can choose to draw the first card 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.740
 or play first. Let's draw another card to let our opponent start. 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.350
 So here we are with 7 cards drawn randomly from our deck. 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.009
 In order to play our cards, we need resources. When you choose 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.329
 your cards, so think of having a good mix of resources, troops or magic cards in hand. 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.939
 If you have bad cards, you can always draw a new hand. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.539
 But with each new hand you will lose a card. 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.969
 So think carefully before turning to this option. 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.630
 Here, our starting hand is promising: with a resource of Blood and Nature, 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.820
 we can already bring our cards into play. The duel can begin! 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.810
 Each round is divided into phases as in all classic trading card games. 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.310
 During these phases, you have several options to act or react to your opponent. 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.690
 Here we are in the preparation phase as shown by the phase indicator. 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.519
 The name of the opponent turns orange when his turn comes. 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.629
 Our opponent is now in the first main phase. It starts with 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.390
 play a resource of Blood. You must confirm each phase, 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.019
 because, depending on the situation, it may happen that you can fight back 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.530
 directly to an action of your opponent thanks to some magic cards, for example. 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 Since our opponent does not enter troop cards in play, the combat phases 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.239
 have passed and our opponent ends his turn. It's now our turn and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.159
 we draw another card. Luckily, this is a Blood resource. 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.700
 The cards you can play are bordered with gold. The game automatically informs you 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.760
 opportunities available to you. Let's start by playing a resource 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.470
 to put our cards into play. Shard of Nature is the ideal choice, 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.930
 because for the moment we have only cards with a threshold of Nature. 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.390
 A new map is bordered with gold. We can play it. 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.480
 Let's look at this map a little closer. 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.379
 The Nature symbol indicates that you need at least one Nature resource 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.819
 to play this card. The number at the top left gives you information on 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.019
 the number of resources needed. The special skill of this card created 2 Shin'hare troops 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.220
 that come into play immediately. This magic card has created 2 troops 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.540
 Here, even if the 2 combat rodents do not have an attack, they 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.560
 Protect enemy attacks with 1 point defense each. 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.010
 Let's move on a bit in the game now. 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.079
 We now have three cards in play, our opponent, on his side, makes 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.170
 enter a troop into play. You can observe this map which appears in the center. 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.269
 The key is to check your special skills to react as efficiently as possible. 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.310
 With other maps or resources, we 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.410
 could directly counter our opponent. The center bar would then display a 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.200
 series of actions and reactions. But for now, the only possible action is 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.380
 to accept that the card is played against us. The special skill of the opposing card is triggered. 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.660
 This one makes us send a card from our hand to our discard pile. 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.190
 Since we have a duplicate card, our choice is all drawn. The opponent ends his 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.190
 turn, and it's back to us! As we want to play a very precise map, 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.350
 let's first add a map of Nature. Here we are with 2 Nature Shards activated 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.780
 and, in total, 3 resources in our possession (2 of Nature and 1 of Blood played previously). 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.290
 We can now play a powerful troop to increase our attack as our defense 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.100
 of a point. And it becomes possible for us to attack for the first time! 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.410
 This is the attack phase where we will deploy all our available troops. 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.850
 Our opponent could certainly block this attack, but his only card having only 1 defense point, 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.770
 it would be automatically destroyed. He prefers to suffer the damage. 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.850
 We are getting closer to our goal: to reduce to 0 the opponent's points of life. 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.070
 Now that you have discovered how to get started in HEX, it's up to you! 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.180
 In our next video, you'll learn more about champions, crimps and creating 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.430
 of your deck. See you soon in HEX!
