00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.500
 This is exactly the Lustenauer I was cycling as you can see so most 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
 Hello 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.730
 I was pushing back and forth oblique means so cheap trick 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.700
 around 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.560
 Such a bike is now basically different from the normal first 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.589
 holland-wheel or normal roads ready Esther cream extremely small 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.029
 that the extremely stable are important stable wheels stable fork 

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.540
 with setting options 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.170
 under constant coventry days at the chains guide the hitchhiker hard 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 Landing or so the chain does not pop off 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 then it does not even turn out to be quite second on the second 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 Gradations in my case from the racing bike areas Jung was happy 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.470
 It had to be easy to reach 15 kilograms 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.590
 in and of itself right man who already in each driver shares for how 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.590
 said correctly and then a few specialists 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.700
 Person bike in this large genus to the hard under a thousand euros too 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.530
 when time is going to be poets beer when the parts from front to back 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.950
 a really official should be 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 so the IGS drivers in the compilation can be calculated well 1 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.450
 5 Center Schramm Soprano flowed who buys once and whatever right 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 It does not take half a year to buy the cutting edge 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.190
 The frame comes with the nice idea of ​​Kiel otherwise the rest 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.610
 The time is basically as it is now common in the driver area 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.000
 primarily from Asia Taiwan China well show off Shimano has as a provider 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.719
 there are absolutely the pole these days 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.589
 Massive things were just heart Metin Kirmis still hold the least 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 kra to things the suspension fork Blue error 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.999
 yes the whole Shimano group of the drive Kogel bottom bracket and so that's all 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.189
 But that does not mean it is bad that you are with the Taiwanese 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.289
 unfortunately something 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.379
 the mechanical engineers bike on land now and quite superior 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.379
 because they simply do everything for all points 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.089
 he sounded no blade and no the Momo singing with the police certainly 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:48.269
 So what about theoretically Farfan in traffic is also 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.959
 already drinking disciplines so-called street fan meeting jump and all 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.159
 such things pack 1 InsO 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.550
 is not quite my thing and policeman that is said for example 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.370
 the many front brake 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.910
 the bell against Dinamo and the reflectors and Asus complain 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:03.799
 excused 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.510
 With SunGard you can also drive so-called for cost races 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.999
 means four in the mix Bamberg under with jumps and elbows out 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.400
 Percent is also a relative 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.300
 it's just not just you alone 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.760
 make mistakes are still three no one can and their kickboxing boxes from the wheel 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.159
 so and then 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.450
 So, it's not all my cup of tea, it's pretty scary, but that does 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.209
 so RWE 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.019
 Injuries are pretty shit but you always have to spend a lot of time 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.489
 can not expose and can not ride a bicycle 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.839
 I protect myself with percent more 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.709
 according to the driver specific protectors knee pads 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.699
 Shin guards gloves and helmet 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.489
 You should stop even if you have the further he has laid on it yet 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.439
 Mitterrand's Sagittarius and I'm really a bit too vain 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.009
 inhabited for now 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.729
 and otherwise hold an official without France calls carapace and also 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:57.419
 turns protectors
