00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.579
 Hello and hello, it's yours again 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.349
 Today I want you in one 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.840
 explain little video like yours 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.460
 rebuild standard xbox from headset 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.509
 Could that be your chat feature 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.609
 could use with your gaming headset 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.099
 The whole is really not a big deal 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.730
 and is even for inexperienced in 30 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.170
 minutes to create 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.120
 but what do you actually need for that 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.220
 not much change 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.590
 Of course you need your xbox one 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:47.630
 headset a pot screwdriver with 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.700
 the size 5 and a commercial 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.380
 soldering iron in my case now 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.330
 Gas powered last but not least needed 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.250
 you still the connecting cable which 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.930
 for your gaming headset mostly for the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.759
 use for the xbox 360 enclosed here 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.530
 Do you have the side that normally in 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.660
 the controller is plugged off 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.550
 and stripping come to light 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.940
 two cables and the silver mass 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.940
 management 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.200
 but what now 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.020
 There are actually three options 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.630
 or variants between which you choose 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.150
 would have the first possible variant 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 opens the speaker your original 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.660
 headsets and uses them already 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 isolated cable as a second option can 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.500
 her the headset cable at one 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.140
 any old spot disconnect 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.600
 stripping and with your adapter cable 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 I chose the third one 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 variant decided and would like that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.050
 cable directly in the adapter exchange here 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.350
 just remove the bottom one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.350
 cover 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.390
 Next, the five would have to screw 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.390
 to solve 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:39.129
 come to light the board with the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:40.480
 four solder joints I want the occupation 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.930
 briefly outline you 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.019
 From the left we start the mass 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.629
 the micro third place is not 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.319
 occupied and last but not least, and his 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.319
 speaker 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.769
 it may be that you depending on the model 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.340
 of a headset eg turtle beach argue 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.620
 or astro the red and the white cable 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.480
 Therefore, swapping would have to be a lesson 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.180
 me before he does it all again 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:26.459
 just assemble once and test it 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:28.230
 if necessary , solder again as a small one 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.549
 thought support here again a picture 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.019
 The board must be the last step 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.140
 you now only the original card 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.840
 Detach and disconnect the cables of your jack cable 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.790
 of course, last but not least 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.560
 screw all together again and 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.140
 you're done with your own 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.410
 built xbox of adapter much fun 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.410
 in order to 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.829
 if you still have questions, it would be me 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.049
 like on my facebook page 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.680

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.720
