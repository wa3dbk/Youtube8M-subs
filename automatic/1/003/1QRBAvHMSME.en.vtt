not the greatest but I'll you can see
the<00:01:12.700> small<00:01:13.299> changes<00:01:14.110> at<00:01:14.619> least<00:01:14.890> um<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.600> what

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
the small changes at least um in what

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.319 
the small changes at least um in what
happens<00:01:17.770> when<00:01:18.009> you<00:01:18.520> change<00:01:18.850> all<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.119> so

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
let's just bring the edges to half and

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.240 
let's just bring the edges to half and
bring<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.020> gray<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.500> little<00:01:23.740> bit<00:01:23.920> just

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
coherence of the lines and that's really

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.150 
coherence of the lines and that's really
all<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.940> can<00:01:49.210> do<00:01:49.390> with<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:49.870> option<00:01:50.320> next<00:01:51.040> is

with less options it's a lot better than

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.420 
with less options it's a lot better than
the<00:04:53.570> actual<00:04:53.720> photoshop<00:04:54.320> app<00:04:54.500> itself<00:04:54.830> one

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
save anything it comes right back to a

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.800 
save anything it comes right back to a
screen<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.490> did<00:05:01.700> it's<00:05:02.210> kind<00:05:02.450> of<00:05:02.630> like<00:05:02.690> a

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
screen that you did it's kind of like a

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.770 
screen that you did it's kind of like a
multitasking<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.730> way<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.120> know<00:05:05.390> it's<00:05:05.630> not

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
multitasking in a way I know it's not

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.420 
multitasking in a way I know it's not
but<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:06.290> a<00:05:06.380> way<00:05:06.530> it's<00:05:06.770> kind<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:07.070> like<00:05:07.220> it

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
but in a way it's kind of like it

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.650 
but in a way it's kind of like it
because<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.790> just<00:05:07.880> comes<00:05:08.090> back<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.419> where<00:05:08.570> you

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
because it just comes back to where you

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.330 
because it just comes back to where you
were<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.590> that's<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.830> really<00:05:09.860> great<00:05:10.100> feature
