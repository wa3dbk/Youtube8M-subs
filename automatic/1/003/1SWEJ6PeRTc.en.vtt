00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.980
 it has cost us a lot to win these two 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.810
 points the objective the objective in 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.480
 wardrobe was this party had to 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.100
 I take it we know that we still 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.380
 much to improve I think there's a lot 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.490
 margin for the team and these two 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.520
 little dots come in handy for 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.200
 take away a burden and perhaps maybe if not 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.490
 we would have won the team 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.410
 psychologically I would have 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.960
 dropped a little bit because in both 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.180
 first matches was against rivals of 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.650
 our league then the best of 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.650
 party I think it's the two points 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.540
 The good thing is that the team in situations 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.580
 difficult has known we have committed 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.860
 mistakes but he has managed to keep 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.600
 with conviction with intensity with 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.760
 the desire to gain anxiety I think 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500
 that in Gijón we passed bill and today 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.460
 It has also taken its toll, but 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.460
 we have been a little better 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.670
 we all put it in high pools 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.070
 he wants you to a responsibility 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.980
 the team knows that we lack matches 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.780
 together to be more rolled for 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.670
 that víctor finds the distance with 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.680
 his peers and that equal all 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.639
 we find by playing is the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.840
 distance with his companions then 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.840
 the team demands 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.860
 of that double exclusion that I think 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.030
 it's excessive punishment I think that really 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.620
 I think this video that has been for what 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.660
 what happened because if you look at the 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.170
 party after there were situations in 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.660
 the two areas and you want that they make the 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.900
 little bit a little bit arbitrary 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.350
 I would not say but it's the same as 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.350
 it's good it's complicated
