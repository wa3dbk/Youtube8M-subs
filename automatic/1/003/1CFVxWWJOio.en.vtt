00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello to all here jailbreak style and 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.549
 today we meet again for the test 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.410
 a 4.7 inch iphone 6 case 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.010
 we will start with bullets and the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.000
 protective case for iphone 6 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.020
 the packaging of this protective shell 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.020
 opens with water 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.109
 that's what it gives at first sight 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.039
 in the hands as soon as we just got 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.730
 open it so it's rather 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.349
 impressive 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.240
 the first time as soon as we take this 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.140
 iphone 6 case 4 goals 7 inches in 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.380
 hands because she's really 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.380
 great 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 I will show you the locations 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.570
 buttons we have the + and - buttons for 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.000
 the volume down we will have the lightning the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.890
 jack as well as the speakers 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.600
 there the power button to unlock 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.450
 lock your device alas the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.350
 camera as well as the flash 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.700
 here is a comparison between the two 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.620
 screen sizes of iphone 5 and 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.040
 the iphone 6 for iphone 5c 4 inches and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.330
 for iphone 6 and 4 7 inches here is a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.479
 comparison between the dimensions of 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.509
 the iphone 5 5 s that like that of 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.670
 the iphone 6 i will put my iphone 5 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.740
 whose protective case for iphone 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 by then you see that iphone 5 is 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.829
 when done little part in this shell 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.020
 iphone says what is really huge 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.100
 so really iphone 6 is going to be huge 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.109
 tell you when we take it in hand 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.549
 it's super impressive 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.740
 I will use the iphone 6 case 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.960
 as if I was using an iphone 6 in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.670
 hands versus the test of power 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.079
 and I'm not coming to both states to 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.649
 the other end of the screen but jacques 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.969
 only to the volume buttons - the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.429
 button power has changed places it is 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.929
 now found at the top right and 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.069
 you can unlock your iphone 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.319
 with your index and that is rather 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.549
 intuitive now I'm doing the test with 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.139
 my right hand and you see how 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.969
 grow directly affect the Bhutan 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.049
 to unlock what is still 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.249
 rather intuitive because now 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.409
 it's directly and your pulse in 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:55.060
 that apple has worked all this 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.189
 but the thumb test I can not 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.780
 to get to the sco is not conclusive for 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.770
 the moment it's the only thing 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.319
 I really do not like the new 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.170
 iphone 6's screen size of 4 7 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.859
 inch but if I buy it on its way out 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.859
 I think I'll get used 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.850
 if you want to get the hull 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.740

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.540
