00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.680
 allow me one 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.400
 look to give the nemetschek allplan 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.530
 re integration and 5 gb in planning 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.130
 method of planning your everyday life in the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.410
 practice will change positively like you 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.480
 here was a ground floor of a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.340
 project already almost complete with 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.350
 allplan planned and can by the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.110
 Use of available assistants 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.430
 technology quickly and intuitively for more 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 components are added 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.980
 all required component properties 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.440
 walls and doors like material 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.480
 and billing method as well as all may 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.340
 Position parameters are taken directly from the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 taken on and into the assistant 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 Building model integrated 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.960
 the virtual allplan building model 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.720
 already eliminates all relevant 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.890
 quantities and components information and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.150
 can then over the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.090
 export function in cpi xml format directly 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.190
 at the b2 for the five dbm 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.190
 planning methods are passed 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.190
 the choice of the data to be transmitted 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.230
 done via the allplan building 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.360
 structure and may additionally for 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.340
 different element turks or 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 visible layer to be filtered 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.149
 the allplan building model becomes 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.189
 then invited in led and stands 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.360
 Immediately for further analysis 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.360
 and evaluations ready 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 the individual steps for a quick 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.810
 accurate and efficient cost estimation 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:05.300
 puts the indicator in the process bar 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:08.190
 by rgb a first step model check 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.890
 The structure of the old building model 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.450
 in building allows an immediate 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.450
 Analysis of the construction 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.070
 second step element planning 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.160
 let us now consider the individual 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.630
 elements and their positions 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.270
 including her close queries for 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.420
 the defined units their assignment 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.280
 to the individual works and the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 unit prices for the cost calculation 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.570
 third step assignment 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.810
 the old object filter selected by 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.299
 assigned in allplan 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.659
 component properties such as the mountain or 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.659
 even after object limp like blanket 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.459
 then the selected 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.209
 allplan objects their planning elements 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.209
 assigned 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.930
 fourth step now 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.420
 the automatic takes place 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.610
 Quantity determination according to the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.500
 the individual positions specified 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.500
 interrogate units and quantities 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.090
 for the publication of the results 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.350
 adaptable reports of the individual 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.350
 trades available 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 Changes and variations are often a 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.940
 essential ingredient of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.599
 project planning the nemetschek allplan 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.520
 and re integration also offers here 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.520
 a perfect solution 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.000
 To illustrate this we return 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.010
 in our example once again 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.420
 Building model of our project back 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.860
 and make some changes here 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.650
 the dividing wall between the entrance hall 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.880
 and the completed one 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.549
 event area should be in our 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.260
 case to be trained in natural wood 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.260
 to put a special accent 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.410
 the function architecture 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.639
 transferred component properties 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.500
 takes over in allplan the 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.260
 desired properties of one 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.520
 component 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.160
 afterwards they will be selected 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.460
 transferred components and immediately 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.460
 visualized 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.479
 then also here are the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.030
 Selected structure stages of the old 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:57.120
 building model directly exported and in 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.320
 updated cpi xml format transfer 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.690
 Now let's look at the building model 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.580
 in age and keep track of the changes 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.229
 for the objects taken over from allplan 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:11.260
 the type warns before the update of the cpi 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.210
 data in age are still no turn with 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.479
 the shade of natural wood in the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.700
 Model view visible 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.010
 after the update, the walls will be filled with the 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.229
 shade of nature conservation in the model 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.680
 View visible and in quantity for this 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.900
 position is recalculated is the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.099
 output of the reports can be the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.750
 changed costs 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.280
 based on the automatic 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.300
 determined quantity changes 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.310
 compare with the open platform 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.970
 allplan and direct communication 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.240
 To benefit too much from now on 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.300
 from the efficiency potential of a 5d in 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.950
 planning method the strategic 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.479
 partnership best engineering performance 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:58.410
 made in germany makes this possible 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.410
 See for yourself
