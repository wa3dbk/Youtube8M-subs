00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
but you see it has definitely got a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.830 
but you see it has definitely got a
shine<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.629> bit

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
shine to it here and it's a little bit

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.250 
shine to it here and it's a little bit
flexible<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:44.719> let's<00:00:45.719> keep<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.200> shape

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
