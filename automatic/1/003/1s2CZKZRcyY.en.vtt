Holly fill fabric scissors a sharpie and
a<00:00:24.119> hot<00:00:24.330> glue<00:00:24.480> gun<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> first<00:00:25.529> step<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.890> very

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
a hot glue gun so the first step is very

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.500 
a hot glue gun so the first step is very
important<00:00:26.609> you're<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> make

so<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.439> flipped<00:00:31.859> over<00:00:32.099> itself<00:00:32.610> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
so it's like flipped over itself so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.570 
so it's like flipped over itself so
there's<00:00:33.480> two<00:00:33.809> layers<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.410> fleece<00:00:34.920> trace<00:00:35.400> out

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a sharpie to trace out three circles

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.080 
a sharpie to trace out three circles
because<00:00:45.420> i'm<00:00:45.870> making<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.739> three<00:00:47.219> pillow<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I'm carefully cutting out both circles

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
I'm carefully cutting out both circles
through<00:00:50.280> both<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> layers<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.690> hot

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
through both of the layers now hot

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.860 
through both of the layers now hot
gluing<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.129> outer<00:00:53.550> edges<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.390> circle

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
gluing the outer edges of a circle

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.100 
gluing the outer edges of a circle
together<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.960> want

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
together like this or if you don't want

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.619 
together like this or if you don't want
to<00:00:58.260> glue<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.920> also<00:00:59.129> saw<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.420> for

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to glue it you can also saw it but for

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.959 
to glue it you can also saw it but for
me<00:01:00.750> hot<00:01:01.020> gluing<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.710> easier<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.550> quicker

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
me hot gluing it was easier and quicker

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
me hot gluing it was easier and quicker
and<00:01:03.420> when<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.289> what<00:01:04.410> to<00:01:04.559> leave<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and when you do this and what to leave a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
and when you do this and what to leave a
little<00:01:05.220> gap<00:01:05.339> open<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> why<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:06.960> scissors

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
little gap open which is why my scissors

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.660 
little gap open which is why my scissors
are<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.979> make<00:01:08.100> sure<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.550> don't

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
are there to make sure that I don't

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.570 
are there to make sure that I don't
accidentally<00:01:09.420> forget<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.259> gap<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
accidentally forget to put a gap and the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.249 
accidentally forget to put a gap and the
reason<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> gap<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.990> so

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
reason we're going to have a gap is so

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.070 
reason we're going to have a gap is so
we<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.130> stuff<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:15.030> pillow<00:01:15.390> afterwards

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
we can stuff the pillow afterwards

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
we can stuff the pillow afterwards
before<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.009> stuff<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> pillow<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:18.149> going

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
before we stuff the pillow we're going

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.139 
before we stuff the pillow we're going
to<00:01:18.539> flip<00:01:18.929> it<00:01:18.959> inside<00:01:19.410> out<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.849> going<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
to flip it inside out so you're going to

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.180 
to flip it inside out so you're going to
put<00:01:21.660> your<00:01:21.690> hand<00:01:22.050> in<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.319> gift<00:01:22.679> that<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.979> left

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
put your hand in the gift that we left

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.029 
put your hand in the gift that we left
and<00:01:23.459> you're<00:01:24.179> basically<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> pull<00:01:25.349> the

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
and you're basically going to pull the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.210 
and you're basically going to pull the
other<00:01:26.280> side<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:28.229> carefully<00:01:28.679> just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
other side out and then carefully just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.600 
other side out and then carefully just
flip<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.539> right<00:01:30.539> side<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.289> this<00:01:32.069> way<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
flip it right side out and this way on

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.830 
flip it right side out and this way on
the<00:01:32.849> side<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.539> has<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.800> nice<00:01:35.630> look<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the side it has this like nice look I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
the side it has this like nice look I
guess<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.319> it<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:37.679> of<00:01:37.709> looks<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.399> sewed

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
guess and it kind of looks like we sewed

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.940 
guess and it kind of looks like we sewed
it<00:01:38.849> even<00:01:39.239> though<00:01:39.330> we<00:01:39.479> just

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
it even though we just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.859 
it even though we just
now<00:01:40.729> we're<00:01:40.880> going<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> stuff<00:01:41.360> our<00:01:41.570> Killough

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
now we're going to stuff our Killough

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.219 
now we're going to stuff our Killough
with<00:01:42.049> some<00:01:42.500> polyfill<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.240> can<00:01:44.450> stuff<00:01:45.049> it

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
with some polyfill and you can stuff it

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.550 
with some polyfill and you can stuff it
so<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:45.799> as<00:01:46.070> fluffy<00:01:46.549> or<00:01:46.939> as<00:01:47.570> flat<00:01:47.990> as<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.409> want

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
so it's as fluffy or as flat as you want

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.139 
so it's as fluffy or as flat as you want
your<00:01:48.710> pillow<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.159> be<00:01:49.340> once<00:01:49.909> you're<00:01:50.030> done<00:01:50.090> with

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
edges and then hot glue it and then just

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.850 
edges and then hot glue it and then just
glue<00:01:57.229> both<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.250> sides<00:01:59.179> together<00:01:59.860> once

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
going to move on to the face so the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.120 
going to move on to the face so the
first<00:02:05.030> phila<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.539> i<00:02:05.569> did<00:02:05.960> was<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.710> heart
