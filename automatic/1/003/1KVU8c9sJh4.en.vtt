00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.110 
there is I think though I think it's
accelerated<00:04:21.370> although<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.580> think<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.880> kind<00:04:22.060> of

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
accelerated although I think it kind of

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.720 
accelerated although I think it kind of
needs<00:04:22.270> it

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
needs it

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.280 
needs it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
it's like they're not really looking at

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.810 
it's like they're not really looking at
the<00:04:24.410> independent<00:04:24.920> scene<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.370> bad<00:04:25.550> way<00:04:25.790> I

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
the independent scene is it bad way I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.130 
the independent scene is it bad way I
