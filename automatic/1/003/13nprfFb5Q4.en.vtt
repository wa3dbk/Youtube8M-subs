00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
down and you can see on the right the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
down and you can see on the right the
color<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.720> there<00:02:40.170> we're<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
color is it's going there we're in the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.970 
color is it's going there we're in the
luminance<00:02:41.099> at<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.549> moment<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.260> we've<00:02:43.530> brought

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
luminance at the moment so we've brought

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680 
luminance at the moment so we've brought
down<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> luminance<00:02:44.790> we're<00:02:45.030> gonna<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
down the luminance we're gonna go to the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.949 
down the luminance we're gonna go to the
saturation<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.069> same<00:02:47.690> thing<00:02:48.690> there

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
saturation and do the same thing there

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.720 
saturation and do the same thing there
were<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.140> saturation<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.519> that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
were the saturation you can see that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.610 
were the saturation you can see that
coming<00:02:51.030> down<00:02:53.870> let's<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.049> look<00:02:55.230> at<00:02:55.440> what

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
coming down let's have a look at what

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.740 
coming down let's have a look at what
we've<00:02:55.829> done<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.849> if<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.030> click<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.450> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
we've done there so if I click that you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.220 
we've done there so if I click that you
can<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.829> greens<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.459> they're

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
can see all the greens and they're

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.360 
can see all the greens and they're
subdued<00:03:01.230> quite<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> bit<00:03:03.350> next<00:03:04.350> thing<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:05.040> we're

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
subdued quite a bit next thing is we're

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.720 
subdued quite a bit next thing is we're
gonna<00:03:05.549> go<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> we're<00:03:07.590> gonna<00:03:07.739> crop<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.340> to

well don't click there and that's that's
our<00:03:36.000> better<00:03:37.000> composed<00:03:37.540> image<00:03:38.189> so<00:03:39.189> we're<00:03:39.340> gonna

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
our better composed image so we're gonna

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.520 
our better composed image so we're gonna
go<00:03:39.640> down<00:03:39.879> to<00:03:40.120> detail<00:03:40.629> now<00:03:40.840> we're<00:03:41.409> gonna

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
go down to detail now we're gonna

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.399 
go down to detail now we're gonna
sharpen<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.189> up<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.599> can<00:03:43.629> see<00:03:44.019> in<00:03:44.140> there

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
sharpen this up and you can see in there

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.500 
sharpen this up and you can see in there
the<00:03:44.920> little<00:03:45.159> window<00:03:46.140> there's<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.409> fair<00:03:47.799> bit<00:03:48.040> of

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the little window there's a fair bit of

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.020 
the little window there's a fair bit of
if<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.629> can<00:03:49.780> see<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.319> video<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:51.030> there

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
if you can see that on a video but there

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.300 
if you can see that on a video but there
is<00:03:52.209> some<00:03:52.840> grain<00:03:53.140> there<00:03:53.500> anyway<00:03:54.040> we're<00:03:54.220> gonna

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
is some grain there anyway we're gonna

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.179 
is some grain there anyway we're gonna
sharpen<00:03:54.640> this<00:03:54.939> up<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:56.260> go<00:03:56.470> we're<00:03:56.739> gonna<00:03:56.890> go<00:03:57.129> to

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
sharpen this up we go we're gonna go to

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.030 
sharpen this up we go we're gonna go to
so<00:03:57.670> many<00:03:57.760> percent<00:03:58.299> well<00:03:59.290> if<00:03:59.379> we<00:03:59.500> press<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.950> Alt

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
so many percent well if we press the Alt

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.460 
so many percent well if we press the Alt
key<00:04:00.099> down<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.819> then<00:04:01.060> use<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.540> moleskin<00:04:02.170> and

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
key down and then use the moleskin and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.640 
key down and then use the moleskin and
drag<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:03.099> masking<00:04:03.640> across<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:05.379> see

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
drag the masking across you see

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.879 
drag the masking across you see
everything<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.489> blank<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:08.470> not<00:04:08.709> gonna

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
everything this blank it's not gonna

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.399 
everything this blank it's not gonna
sharpen<00:04:09.579> and<00:04:10.090> everything<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:10.750> why<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.170> is

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
sharpen and everything that's why it is

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.759 
sharpen and everything that's why it is
so<00:04:11.859> we'll<00:04:12.010> leave<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.609> at<00:04:12.819> that

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
so we'll leave it at that

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.770 
so we'll leave it at that
we<00:04:14.769> need<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.190> reduce<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.940> noise<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.600> we're

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
we need to reduce the noise so we're

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.849 
we need to reduce the noise so we're
gonna<00:04:16.900> take<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.709> down<00:04:18.329> about<00:04:19.329> 21<00:04:19.989> volts<00:04:20.530> are

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
gonna take this down about 21 volts are

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.360 
gonna take this down about 21 volts are
gonna<00:04:20.979> take<00:04:21.850> off<00:04:22.060> some<00:04:22.360> color<00:04:22.660> noise<00:04:23.099> if<00:04:24.099> there

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
gonna take off some color noise if there

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.100 
gonna take off some color noise if there
is<00:04:24.490> some<00:04:24.669> color<00:04:25.000> noise<00:04:25.889> so<00:04:26.940> if<00:04:27.940> we<00:04:28.180> enlarge<00:04:28.840> it

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
is some color noise so if we enlarge it

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.420 
is some color noise so if we enlarge it
up<00:04:29.229> we<00:04:29.470> can<00:04:29.620> see<00:04:31.169> that's<00:04:32.169> not<00:04:32.380> bad<00:04:32.440> image<00:04:33.280> you

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
up we can see that's not bad image you

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.450 
up we can see that's not bad image you
can<00:04:33.610> see<00:04:33.639> little<00:04:34.389> hairs<00:04:34.690> on<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.440> on<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.250> leaf

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
can see little hairs on the on the leaf

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.360 
can see little hairs on the on the leaf
there<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.720> in<00:04:37.900> there<00:04:38.169> there<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.979> little<00:04:39.190> bit

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
there and in there there is a little bit

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.510 
there and in there there is a little bit
of<00:04:39.460> grain<00:04:39.729> but<00:04:40.000> not<00:04:40.180> too<00:04:40.389> much<00:04:41.220> so<00:04:42.220> when

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
of grain but not too much so when

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.860 
of grain but not too much so when
they're<00:04:42.729> gonna<00:04:42.849> go<00:04:43.060> down<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.599> lens

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
they're gonna go down to lens

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.589 
they're gonna go down to lens
Corrections<00:04:44.620> we're<00:04:45.099> gonna<00:04:45.220> enable<00:04:45.880> the

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
Corrections we're gonna enable the

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.589 
Corrections we're gonna enable the
profile<00:04:47.349> of<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.710> lens<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:49.180> there's<00:04:49.449> not

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
profile of the lens and there's not

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.540 
profile of the lens and there's not
really<00:04:49.810> much<00:04:50.110> it's<00:04:50.590> change<00:04:50.919> there<00:04:51.250> but

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
really much it's change there but

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.120 
really much it's change there but
there's<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.479> lot<00:04:52.599> of<00:04:52.690> lens<00:04:53.229> profiles<00:04:53.860> in

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
there's a lot of lens profiles in

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.210 
there's a lot of lens profiles in
Lightroom<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:56.020> will<00:04:56.260> make<00:04:56.530> your

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
Lightroom and so it will make your

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.080 
Lightroom and so it will make your
particular<00:04:57.699> lens<00:04:58.650> also<00:04:59.650> want<00:05:00.039> to<00:05:00.099> remove<00:05:00.460> any

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
particular lens also want to remove any

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
particular lens also want to remove any
chromatic<00:05:01.659> aberration<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:04.150> that's<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.960> let's

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
chromatic aberration so that's it let's

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.570 
chromatic aberration so that's it let's
bring<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:05.919> back<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.729> as<00:05:07.479> it<00:05:07.750> was<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.500> we<00:05:09.099> take

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
bring that back to as it was and we take

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.939 
bring that back to as it was and we take
a<00:05:09.610> look<00:05:09.909> at<00:05:10.120> that<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:11.199> that's<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.560> lot<00:05:11.740> better

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
a look at that and that's a lot better

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.439 
a look at that and that's a lot better
than<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.880> was

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
than it was

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.520 
than it was
now<00:05:13.990> I'm<00:05:14.110> gonna<00:05:14.229> hit<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.620> backslash<00:05:15.099> key

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
now I'm gonna hit the backslash key

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.800 
now I'm gonna hit the backslash key
which<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.710> where<00:05:17.949> we<00:05:18.099> were<00:05:18.310> so<00:05:18.699> that's<00:05:18.880> whoa

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
which is where we were so that's whoa

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.110 
which is where we were so that's whoa
and<00:05:20.500> this<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.770> where<00:05:20.949> we<00:05:21.099> are<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.729> vast

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
and this is where we are so is a vast

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.749 
and this is where we are so is a vast
difference

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
difference

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.999 
difference
in<00:05:23.999> that<00:05:25.279> next<00:05:26.279> we're<00:05:26.490> gonna<00:05:26.580> add<00:05:26.999> in<00:05:27.599> a<00:05:27.689> fete

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
in that next we're gonna add in a fete

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.579 
in that next we're gonna add in a fete
we're<00:05:29.009> gonna<00:05:29.159> add<00:05:29.430> a<00:05:29.460> post<00:05:30.360> crop<00:05:31.169> than<00:05:31.409> that

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
we're gonna add a post crop than that

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.959 
we're gonna add a post crop than that
this<00:05:32.129> gonna<00:05:32.460> bark<00:05:32.789> on<00:05:33.029> the<00:05:33.150> corners<00:05:33.599> to<00:05:33.809> help

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
this gonna bark on the corners to help

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.969 
this gonna bark on the corners to help
bring<00:05:35.969> the<00:05:36.150> eye<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:36.719> middle<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.349> we're

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
bring the eye to the middle so we're

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.420 
bring the eye to the middle so we're
we've<00:05:38.580> got<00:05:38.819> in<00:05:38.969> there<00:05:39.240> about<00:05:39.839> 13<00:05:40.409> I'm<00:05:41.279> gonna

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
we've got in there about 13 I'm gonna

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.570 
we've got in there about 13 I'm gonna
move<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:41.789> midpoint<00:05:42.240> out<00:05:42.449> of<00:05:42.659> it<00:05:43.249> long<00:05:44.249> so<00:05:44.460> I'm

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
move the midpoint out of it long so I'm

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.390 
move the midpoint out of it long so I'm
gonna<00:05:44.729> increase<00:05:45.089> the<00:05:45.270> feather<00:05:45.479> to<00:05:46.069> two<00:05:47.069> stove

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
gonna increase the feather to two stove

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.540 
gonna increase the feather to two stove
assembly<00:05:48.469> so<00:05:49.469> again<00:05:49.800> we're<00:05:50.039> gonna<00:05:50.189> do<00:05:50.400> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
assembly so again we're gonna do the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.719 
assembly so again we're gonna do the
backslash<00:05:50.999> key<00:05:51.330> that's<00:05:51.719> before<00:05:52.189> this<00:05:53.189> after

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
backslash key that's before this after

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.420 
backslash key that's before this after
it's<00:05:54.689> a<00:05:54.809> vastly<00:05:55.349> different<00:05:57.889> image<00:05:58.889> to<00:05:59.069> one<00:05:59.249> we

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
it's a vastly different image to one we

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.820 
it's a vastly different image to one we
had<00:05:59.639> to<00:05:59.669> start<00:06:00.149> with<00:06:00.860> so<00:06:02.899> are<00:06:03.899> we<00:06:04.139> gonna<00:06:04.319> do<00:06:04.589> any

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
had to start with so are we gonna do any

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.389 
had to start with so are we gonna do any
more<00:06:05.509> we<00:06:06.509> can<00:06:06.719> do<00:06:08.599> so<00:06:09.599> it<00:06:09.779> with<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.529> gradient

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:11.399 
more we can do so it with the gradient

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:15.260 
more we can do so it with the gradient
tool<00:06:12.889> we<00:06:13.889> can<00:06:14.039> bring<00:06:14.249> the<00:06:14.399> gradient<00:06:14.849> tool<00:06:15.059> from

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
tool we can bring the gradient tool from

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.929 
tool we can bring the gradient tool from
the<00:06:15.419> left<00:06:15.689> and<00:06:16.379> you<00:06:16.499> can<00:06:16.529> see<00:06:16.860> this<00:06:17.069> area<00:06:17.639> and

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:17.939 
the left and you can see this area and

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.700 
the left and you can see this area and
the<00:06:18.059> center<00:06:18.509> area<00:06:18.659> there<00:06:19.020> and<00:06:19.050> these<00:06:19.319> areas

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
the center area there and these areas

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.639 
the center area there and these areas
are<00:06:19.919> where<00:06:20.279> of<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.460> nets<00:06:20.930> we<00:06:21.930> can<00:06:22.169> take<00:06:22.469> this

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
are where of the nets we can take this

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:27.619 
are where of the nets we can take this
and<00:06:22.979> reduce<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.909> vennett<00:06:25.189> vignetting<00:06:26.629> the

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
and reduce the vennett vignetting the

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:28.999 
and reduce the vennett vignetting the
effect<00:06:27.990> so<00:06:28.319> I'm<00:06:28.379> gonna<00:06:28.529> bring<00:06:28.709> that<00:06:28.770> over

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
effect so I'm gonna bring that over

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.600 
effect so I'm gonna bring that over
there<00:06:29.399> and<00:06:30.289> saturation<00:06:31.289> I'm<00:06:31.529> gonna<00:06:31.709> reduce

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
there and saturation I'm gonna reduce

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.510 
there and saturation I'm gonna reduce
that<00:06:32.639> down<00:06:32.999> a<00:06:33.060> little<00:06:33.149> bit<00:06:33.830> so<00:06:34.830> that's<00:06:34.979> taking

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
that down a little bit so that's taking

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.579 
that down a little bit so that's taking
those<00:06:35.699> greens<00:06:36.089> down<00:06:36.449> in<00:06:36.749> fact<00:06:36.990> it's<00:06:37.199> taking

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:37.589 
those greens down in fact it's taking

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:41.420 
those greens down in fact it's taking
all<00:06:37.860> colors<00:06:38.459> down<00:06:39.259> if<00:06:40.259> we<00:06:40.409> click<00:06:40.649> on<00:06:40.770> this<00:06:40.949> here

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
all colors down if we click on this here

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.570 
all colors down if we click on this here
we<00:06:41.729> can<00:06:41.759> see<00:06:42.149> before<00:06:42.629> and<00:06:42.839> after<00:06:43.370> you<00:06:44.370> can<00:06:44.399> see

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
we can see before and after you can see

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.219 
we can see before and after you can see
that<00:06:45.029> leaf<00:06:45.959> at<00:06:46.529> the<00:06:46.740> side<00:06:48.199> over<00:06:49.199> here<00:06:49.469> is<00:06:50.189> now

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
that leaf at the side over here is now

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.709 
that leaf at the side over here is now
not<00:06:52.229> not<00:06:52.770> so<00:06:52.979> red<00:06:53.219> we're<00:06:53.699> not<00:06:53.819> gonna<00:06:53.969> do<00:06:54.330> quad

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:54.719 
not not so red we're not gonna do quad

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.749 
not not so red we're not gonna do quad
and<00:06:54.959> bring<00:06:55.139> that<00:06:55.259> up<00:06:55.319> a<00:06:55.499> little<00:06:55.709> bit<00:06:55.919> I<00:06:56.159> would

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
and bring that up a little bit I would

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:03.560 
and bring that up a little bit I would
just<00:06:57.740> 25%<00:06:58.740> down<00:07:00.529> so<00:07:01.529> we're<00:07:01.740> closer

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
just 25% down so we're closer

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.140 
just 25% down so we're closer
okay<00:07:04.570> so<00:07:04.630> that's<00:07:05.050> most<00:07:05.440> of<00:07:05.740> the<00:07:06.150> basic

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
okay so that's most of the basic

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.719 
okay so that's most of the basic
retouching<00:07:07.540> done<00:07:08.160> they're<00:07:09.160> going<00:07:09.310> to<00:07:09.400> go<00:07:09.550> up

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
retouching done they're going to go up

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.469 
retouching done they're going to go up
and<00:07:10.060> add<00:07:10.270> a<00:07:11.280> gradient<00:07:12.280> to<00:07:12.580> this<00:07:12.820> to<00:07:13.090> add<00:07:13.240> some

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 
and add a gradient to this to add some

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.219 
and add a gradient to this to add some
light<00:07:13.690> I'm<00:07:14.110> gonna<00:07:14.290> draw<00:07:14.979> out<00:07:15.250> big<00:07:15.580> gradient<00:07:16.229> at

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
light I'm gonna draw out big gradient at
