that Adam you know there there's I give

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.209 
that Adam you know there there's I give
you<00:00:50.309> several<00:00:51.320> answers<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.100> I'll

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you several answers to that but I'll

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
you several answers to that but I'll
start<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.140> simple

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
start with you know the the simple

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
start with you know the the simple
biological<00:00:56.370> fact<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.030> about

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
biological fact if you think about

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
biological fact if you think about
almost<00:00:57.660> anything<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.829> surgery

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
almost anything we have to have surgery

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000 
almost anything we have to have surgery
for<00:00:59.610> nature<00:01:00.210> wins<00:01:00.449> every<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.829> can

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
for nature wins every time but we can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
for nature wins every time but we can
make<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.340> artificial<00:01:02.730> joint<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.809> an

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
make an artificial joint we can make an

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.309 
make an artificial joint we can make an
an<00:01:04.469> artificial<00:01:05.100> valve<00:01:05.719> we<00:01:06.719> can<00:01:06.899> create<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:07.319 
an artificial valve we can create a

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.230 
an artificial valve we can create a
dialysis<00:01:07.979> machine<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.609> can<00:01:08.759> put<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.209> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
dialysis machine we can put you on a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
dialysis machine we can put you on a
ventilator<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.840> there's<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> single

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
ventilator but there's not a single

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.639 
ventilator but there's not a single
example<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.639> can<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.299> where<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:13.469> what

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
example I can think of where what what

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.800 
example I can think of where what what
man<00:01:13.889> what<00:01:14.310> man<00:01:14.520> makes<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.149> better<00:01:15.359> than<00:01:15.630> what

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
man what man makes is better than what

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.649 
man what man makes is better than what
nature<00:01:15.990> creates<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.189> say<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:18.209> shouldn't<00:01:18.509> be

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
nature creates and say we shouldn't be

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
nature creates and say we shouldn't be
surprised<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.409> find<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.829> that<00:01:20.159> inside<00:01:20.700> our

it's shouldn't surprise us that anything

we make to try and replace this amazing

to last as long as perform as well and I
think<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.309> main<00:01:56.520> issue<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.630> reality

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
think that's the main issue in reality

think that's the main issue in reality

I<00:02:05.010> would<00:02:05.190> rather<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.640> prosthetic<00:02:06.510> valve

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
I would rather have a prosthetic valve

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.890 
I would rather have a prosthetic valve
than<00:02:07.260> a<00:02:07.380> damaged<00:02:08.010> non<00:02:08.280> functioning<00:02:09.030> mitral

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
than a damaged non functioning mitral

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.420 
than a damaged non functioning mitral
valve<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.320> I'd<00:02:10.440> much<00:02:10.619> rather<00:02:10.650> have<00:02:11.100> someone

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
valve but I'd much rather have someone

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.150 
valve but I'd much rather have someone
reconstruct<00:02:12.270> my<00:02:12.450> own<00:02:12.660> valve<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.890> whole

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
reconstruct my own valve and this whole

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.070 
reconstruct my own valve and this whole
meeting<00:02:14.550> has<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.120> been<00:02:15.330> about<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
meeting has really been about the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.080 
meeting has really been about the
techniques<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.460> allow<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
techniques that really allow that to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.180 
techniques that really allow that to
happen<00:02:18.270> every<00:02:18.900> day<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.320> almost<00:02:19.650> every

so<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.519> one<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.850> many<00:03:45.090> take<00:03:45.390> on

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
so you know that one of the many take on

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.390 
so you know that one of the many take on
messages<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.380> meeting<00:03:46.620> today<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.220> we've

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
messages of this meeting today is we've

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.729 
messages of this meeting today is we've
got<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.970> repair<00:03:48.390> mitral<00:03:48.840> valves<00:03:49.200> because<00:03:49.350> it

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
got to repair mitral valves because it

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.250 
got to repair mitral valves because it
translates<00:03:50.459> into<00:03:50.790> years<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.750> life<00:03:51.989> for

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
translates into years of life for

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.979 
translates into years of life for
individual<00:03:52.890> patients

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.479 

but<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.110> always<00:03:59.290> tell<00:03:59.590> every<00:03:59.920> patient<00:04:00.400> that

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
but I always tell every patient that

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.390 
but I always tell every patient that
nothing<00:04:01.090> lasts<00:04:01.480> forever<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:02.290> say<00:04:02.530> especially

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
nothing lasts forever you say especially

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.790 
nothing lasts forever you say especially
younger<00:04:03.940> patients<00:04:04.629> down<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:05.080> age<00:04:05.349> group<00:04:05.379> I

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
younger patients down this age group I

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.170 
younger patients down this age group I
would<00:04:05.950> expect<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.670> be<00:04:06.819> his<00:04:06.940> only

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
would expect this to be his only

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.809 
would expect this to be his only
operation<00:04:08.019> yeah<00:04:08.680> for<00:04:09.040> young<00:04:09.250> patients<00:04:09.730> I

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
operation yeah for young patients I

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.580 
operation yeah for young patients I
operate<00:04:10.120> on<00:04:10.150> lots<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.569> patients<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.140> are<00:04:11.230> 20

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590
