fourth beat the left hand we never
really<00:02:04.040> use<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.420> right<00:02:05.600> hand

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
really use it it's just the right hand

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.430 
really use it it's just the right hand
but<00:02:06.440> after<00:02:08.410> 1<00:02:09.410> 2<00:02:10.100> 3

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
but after 1 2 3

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.590 
but after 1 2 3
the<00:02:12.440> right<00:02:12.680> hand<00:02:13.040> goes<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.519> very<00:02:14.239> next

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
the right hand goes to the very next

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.810 
the right hand goes to the very next
chord<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.880> very<00:02:17.090> next<00:02:17.269> chord<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:19.550> core

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
chord so the very next chord is the core

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.470 
chord so the very next chord is the core
of<00:02:19.850> D<00:02:20.330> major<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.769> right<00:02:22.040> now<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.280> have<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.760> D<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
of D major so right now we have a D and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.270 
of D major so right now we have a D and
F<00:02:23.690> sharp<00:02:24.100> now<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.400> after<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:27.200> 4<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:28.400> 1<00:02:28.880> again

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
F sharp now and after the 4 in 1 again

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.890 
F sharp now and after the 4 in 1 again
the<00:02:31.280> left<00:02:31.489> hand<00:02:31.760> goes<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:34.370> main<00:02:34.900> demand

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
the left hand goes the main demand

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.740 
the left hand goes the main demand
response<00:02:36.470> OD<00:02:36.980> d<00:02:37.220> on<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.550> left<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.570> more

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
response OD d on the left so one more

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.930 
response OD d on the left so one more
time<00:02:38.830> 1<00:02:39.830> 2<00:02:40.550> 3<00:02:45.489> 4

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.990 

so<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.330> idea<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.550> in<00:02:53.550> these<00:02:53.760> terms

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
so this is the idea so in these terms

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.170 
so this is the idea so in these terms
the<00:02:54.740> very<00:02:55.740> first<00:02:56.040> core<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.460> song<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.940> like

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the very first core of the song is like

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.990 
the very first core of the song is like
the<00:02:57.360> fork<00:02:57.690> from<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:59.130> previous<00:02:59.640> quarter

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the fork from the previous quarter

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
the fork from the previous quarter
doesn't<00:03:00.420> really<00:03:00.540> exist<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
doesn't really exist but this is the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.910 
doesn't really exist but this is the
best<00:03:02.220> way<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.610> about<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.480> four<00:03:04.470> one

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
best way to think about it so four one

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.090 
best way to think about it so four one
two<00:03:05.700> three<00:03:05.730> four<00:03:06.500> one<00:03:07.500> two<00:03:08.010> three<00:03:08.430> four<00:03:10.100> this

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
two three four one two three four this

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
two three four one two three four this
chord<00:03:11.490> ad<00:03:12.300> F<00:03:13.140> sharp<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.460> in<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.940> these

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
chord ad F sharp and then in one these

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.850 
chord ad F sharp and then in one these
have<00:03:15.780> starboard<00:03:16.260> G<00:03:16.790> four<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:18.570> two<00:03:19.080> three<00:03:19.110> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
have starboard G four one two three and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.760

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.479 

and<00:04:35.409> also<00:04:36.409> something<00:04:36.619> as<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:37.009> can<00:04:37.219> do<00:04:37.339> right

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:37.489 
and also something as we can do right

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:43.239 
and also something as we can do right
here<00:04:37.789> is<00:04:38.469> for<00:04:39.469> example<00:04:39.619> it's<00:04:39.979> CDs<00:04:41.830> we<00:04:42.830> compress

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:43.249 
here is for example it's CDs we compress

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.820 
here is for example it's CDs we compress
always<00:04:43.909> there's<00:04:44.479> one<00:04:44.929> key<00:04:45.139> on<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:45.409> left<00:04:45.589> hand

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
always there's one key on the left hand

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.159 
always there's one key on the left hand
which<00:04:46.459> is<00:04:46.489> closest<00:04:47.089> to<00:04:47.119> the<00:04:47.330> right<00:04:47.599> hand<00:04:47.899> here

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
which is closest to the right hand here

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.589 
which is closest to the right hand here
is<00:04:48.289> D<00:04:48.529> this<00:04:49.149> D<00:04:50.709> in<00:04:51.709> B<00:04:51.979> minor<00:04:52.219> should<00:04:52.519> be<00:04:52.729> in<00:04:53.300> C

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
is D this D in B minor should be in C

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.320 
is D this D in B minor should be in C
major<00:04:53.779> C<00:04:54.319> so<00:04:54.529> this<00:04:54.709> key<00:04:55.009> which<00:04:55.849> is<00:04:55.969> closest<00:04:56.300> to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
major C so this key which is closest to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.669 
major C so this key which is closest to
the<00:04:56.449> right<00:04:56.659> hand<00:04:56.899> we<00:04:56.989> can<00:04:57.139> press<00:04:57.379> it<00:04:57.529> always

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:57.679 
the right hand we can press it always

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:08.780 
the right hand we can press it always
whenever<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.309> right<00:04:58.339> time<00:04:58.639> is<00:04:58.759> up

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:32.490 

you

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.610 

so<00:05:33.500> this<00:05:34.040> is<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:35.180> intro<00:05:35.540> but<00:05:35.960> then<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.320> just

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
so this is the intro but then you just

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.080 
so this is the intro but then you just
like<00:05:36.860> play<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.340> twice

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
like play it twice

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.900 
like play it twice
later<00:05:38.540> on<00:05:38.840> we<00:05:39.770> start<00:05:40.070> with<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:40.310> main<00:05:40.550> part<00:05:40.760> of

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
later on we start with the main part of

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.210 
later on we start with the main part of
the<00:05:41.060> song<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.449> we<00:05:41.600> play<00:05:41.810> this<00:05:41.960> all<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.350> time

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
the song and we play this all the time

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.170 
the song and we play this all the time
so<00:05:43.729> that<00:05:44.000> is<00:05:44.120> all<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.540> time<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.229> I<00:05:46.060> would<00:05:47.060> keep

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
so that is all the time and I would keep

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.000 
so that is all the time and I would keep
playing<00:05:47.479> this<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:48.260> same<00:05:48.440> thing<00:05:48.470> all<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:48.979> time

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
playing this the same thing all the time

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.000 
playing this the same thing all the time
but<00:05:49.940> we<00:05:50.419> can<00:05:50.630> also<00:05:50.810> play<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.260> same<00:05:51.470> thing<00:05:51.770> a

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
but we can also play the same thing a

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.770 
but we can also play the same thing a
little<00:05:52.280> bit<00:05:52.460> lower<00:05:52.639> on<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:52.910> keyboard<00:05:53.330> so

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
little bit lower on the keyboard so

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.540 
little bit lower on the keyboard so
after<00:05:53.990> we<00:05:54.110> play<00:05:54.260> this<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.710> intro<00:05:55.040> and<00:05:55.250> a

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
after we play this in the intro and a

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.210 
after we play this in the intro and a
little<00:05:56.270> bit<00:05:56.449> more<00:05:56.690> in<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.050> first<00:05:57.320> at<00:05:58.100> the

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
little bit more in the first at the

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.920 
little bit more in the first at the
beginning<00:05:58.639> of<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.850> main<00:05:59.030> part<00:05:59.300> of<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.479> song

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
beginning of the main part of the song

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.050 
beginning of the main part of the song
we<00:06:00.260> can<00:06:00.440> play<00:06:00.620> exactly<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:01.010> same<00:06:01.070> thing<00:06:01.460> one

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
we can play exactly the same thing one

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
we can play exactly the same thing one
octave<00:06:02.389> lower<00:06:02.419> the<00:06:02.930> keeper<00:06:03.289> so<00:06:04.840> exactly<00:06:05.840> same

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
octave lower the keeper so exactly same

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:14.850 
octave lower the keeper so exactly same
thing

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.010 

you

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.180 

something<00:06:19.020> else<00:06:19.140> we<00:06:19.320> can<00:06:19.530> do<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.890> it<00:06:19.980> sounds

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
something else we can do and it sounds

good

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
good

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.520 
good
is<00:06:20.790> this<00:06:21.000> at<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.660> very<00:06:21.840> last<00:06:21.990> call<00:06:22.230> on<00:06:22.440> the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
is this at the very last call on the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.550 
is this at the very last call on the
base<00:06:22.770> we<00:06:22.950> can<00:06:23.010> use<00:06:23.340> ie<00:06:23.610> instead<00:06:24.360> of<00:06:24.570> CC<00:06:25.230> so

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
base we can use ie instead of CC so

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.610 
base we can use ie instead of CC so
we'll<00:06:25.770> be<00:06:25.950> C<00:06:26.280> major<00:06:26.490> over<00:06:27.060> B<00:06:27.270> over<00:06:27.660> B<00:06:27.840> so<00:06:28.410> let's

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
we'll be C major over B over B so let's

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:44.200 
we'll be C major over B over B so let's
see<00:06:28.800> what

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.409 

but<00:06:44.810> there<00:06:44.900> is<00:06:45.020> all<00:06:45.229> the<00:06:45.350> time<00:06:45.620> and<00:06:46.009> then

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
but there is all the time and then

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.980 
but there is all the time and then
there's<00:06:47.620> like<00:06:48.620> things<00:06:49.130> calm<00:06:49.430> down<00:06:49.460> a<00:06:49.880> bit

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
there's like things calm down a bit

00:06:49.990 --> 00:07:04.790
