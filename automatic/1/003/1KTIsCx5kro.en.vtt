mirrors<00:02:09.070> are<00:02:09.250> long<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.030> there's<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.209> lot<00:02:10.300> of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
mirrors are long and there's a lot of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.910 
mirrors are long and there's a lot of
vision<00:02:10.720> from<00:02:10.929> those<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.350> that's<00:02:11.560> all<00:02:11.709> quite

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
vision from those so that's all quite

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.059

good<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.720> instrument<00:02:14.290> cluster<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.830> very

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
good the instrument cluster is very

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.920 
good the instrument cluster is very
clear<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.489> redo<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.120> not<00:02:16.300> obstructed<00:02:16.630> by

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
clear to redo it is not obstructed by

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.199

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
but I mean this isn't a sports car so

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.530 
but I mean this isn't a sports car so
maybe<00:02:34.329> that's<00:02:34.630> probably<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:36.209> small<00:02:37.209> price<00:02:37.510> to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
maybe that's probably a small price to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.349 
maybe that's probably a small price to
pay

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359
