00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.350
 Human interactions with fragile sand dunes can enhance erosion. 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.130
 It is important that people look after the dunes as they are home to the endangered species 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.469
 The shorebird species such as the New Zealand New Dotterel put their eggs there. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.590
 For example this part of Morwayway is a designated route. 4 wheel drive 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.990
 Dune vehicles are driven daily by dune 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.629
 Make tire paths that can promote corrosion. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 In many parts of the coast vehicles did great damage. 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.820
 Riding is also a popular activity 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.430
 That has the ability to corrode the beach. 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.390
 Fencing boards of walking trails to prevent people walking on sand dunes. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.530
 However erosion can occur on the two tracks and is enhanced by wind leaking. 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.400
 Vegetation is necessary to stabilize sand dunes. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.000
 The vegetation traps sand and is kept in place. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.400
 If the vegetation gets removed the wind will be removed sand leaving the blast. 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 If vegetation is removed natural dune can provide interior. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
 Originally the coastal land in Morway was covered in the original vegetation. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.740
 But through the 1870s the sheep began to graze livestock, causing problems. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.440
 Damage to vegetation by animals that graze causes sand dunes to migrate inland, 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.600
 With some reported dunes have reached up to 90 meters, 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.000
 Such youngsters are in T-Baki in Northland. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.886
 In 1880, 46,000 hectares of land were covered by sand dunes. 

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:58.300
 By 1909 this area had risen to 120 thousand hectares. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.000
 In 1903 Parliament (NZ) passed the Law of Sand Crawling. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.440
 But little has been done until the 1920s and the 1930s when there were attempts to stabilize the sand 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.480
 By planting the exotic marram grass that is native to France. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.200
 In 1932 he began planting pine seedlings to create and dehydrate forests. 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.000
 This was a success in turning the tide of sand crawling. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.519
 Since then he has been trying to rescue me and has included sand dunes in the cultivation of native species. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.400
 Today you can see many plant species that grow in the sand dunes of Morway. 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.000
 Starting with local species such as spinifex, 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.300
 Golden yellow grass, 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.500
 Rabbit tail grass 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 The tree was Caro, 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.550
 As well as exotic ice plant. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.270
 I hope to see this documentary strengthened your understanding of the coastal 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.300
 Operations and their importance to people. 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.350
 Thanks for watching.
