00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.780
 who is the rake is said to be a 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.379
 humanoid creature with white skin eyes 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.570
 black elongated limbs and with some 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.080
 sharp fingers shaped like blades 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.750
 who give his name 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.930
 lives in the shadows and likes to observe 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.210
 People look at people with 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.630
 patience always waiting in the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.059
 darkness 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.360
 it is said that you only realize that he 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.670
 It is there when you want it 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.320
 the places where I usually cut like this are 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.320
 dark corners of the rooms 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.090
 the treetops or any 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.090
 place in general where they shadows 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.930
 dementia always accompanied the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.880
 rake that once his victim has 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.500
 noticed his presence no longer has 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.960
 salvation 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.810
 very few stories of that the rake 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.940
 attacking people directly as 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.700
 seems to prefer to take their prey to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.390
 edge of dementia and wait until 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.600
 no longer able to kill themselves 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.810
 you have done them in your dreams and whispers 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.450
 While they sleep, they cause them to notice that 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.870
 he is there looking 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 appreciating the foot of the bed 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.670
 making your eyes shine from the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 darkness until it is impossible 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 endure that madness 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 its nature is uncertain and this is what 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.700
 that makes your 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.759
 manifestation 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.770
 the only proofs of its existence are 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.210
 the apparent mentions in the notes 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 suicides over time 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.940
 suicide note 1964 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 while I prepare to take my life 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.920
 I feel it necessary to mitigate any pain 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.120
 guilt that I can provoke through this 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.740
 act 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.680
 it's nobody's fault but that of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.290
 the first time after they say their 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.290
 presence the second I woke up and I saw it 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.829
 the third I woke up and I heard her voice and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.659
 I saw his eyes I can not sleep because of terror 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.370
 of what might happen the next time 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:26.370
 I can not wake up anymore 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.370
 goodbye 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.240
 the diary of a sailor 1691 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.010
 and not in a dream from my feet 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.380
 bed I felt a sensation 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.170
 he took everything 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.599
 is to return to england 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.110
 we should not return here by orders the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.110
 rake 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.390
 so many supposed testimonies are 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.210
 offered to prove the existence of 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.460
 rake that until today is nothing more than 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.930
 a legend that terrifies us in the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.090
 darkness when we are alone 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.569
 when nobody can do anything to 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.569
 help us
