00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 and that's okay, everyone's gonna be well. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.280
 for you this time an edition boxing 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.620
 of collector of the game in odds 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 gongs collector's edition of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.070
 united states that is different from 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 European 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.930
 Let's see what comes in this issue here is 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 that the back of it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 all the content here I'll show 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.070
 inside the game 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 I side ahead and the other side will 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.140
 be a simple issue she did not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 So much comes, but what comes is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.680
 interesting to show clearly above 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 from edition to game 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.239
 unfortunately lately education 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:00.420
 children's book more at the end of the game 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:06.020
 fluminense comes a dlc with flame new fit 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.400
 to him what is the corner is the appearance 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 of these three superman characters 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 batman wonder woman and so on 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.950
 fifth web is a move to want 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.320
 or all copies of your edits 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.080
 and started from scratch with even the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 editions of comic books that had 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 they had gone out of line and returned with everything 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 so it looks like something more classic 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.540
 new thing 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 technically not mid- 2011 but not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.119
 is the same as the one in the game you can 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.970
 see that wonder woman for example 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.560
 You're not in that human being. 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.820
 something that has to do with 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 mythology there in adapting to feather 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 besides cibeles and the clothes 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:06.119
 here is the code to download the movie 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.750
 10 out of 10 think it's the movie of the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.039
 justice, if I'm not mistaken, it's 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.980
 history of this game 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.390
 of the 10 that is the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:23.420
 the apocalypse so here are two manuals 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.180
 one with series' advertising invests 5 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:37.400
 with the products the country chic control 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:44.450
 for Morrow and as cap and not 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:50.030
 He left everything usual fine too 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.760
 in this edition the comic telling the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.569
 story the day before I took a look 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.040
 on the internet it seems like the joker 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.310
 kidnapping him was gaining 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.500
 first penning to happen but for what 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.260
 talks about it in the magazine and making 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 and saw appointment 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:16.940
 both here on the back cover of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.340
 box and yes the greatest heroes I am 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.200
 greatest threats marina 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.980
 I think this is the context of the game yet 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.519
 I did not play a good investment, I do not know 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:34.400
 how many pages it does not seem to be very 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:39.579
 It does not look like it is not read the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.579
 end the scam 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:56.060
 I am 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:14.340
 she comes with two enamelled pieces goes 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:18.450
 fit the box because a neighbor of it is 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.489
 long and sincere I do not understand the 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.970
 universe of medicine of justice I know 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.650
 that the wonder woman has an a ship 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.780
 invisible 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.680
 I think it's not that, it's not because it's too 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.970
 little 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.970
 ketamine lived maybe i do not know 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.760
 Good, I think you can see right. 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.790
 the target applying I think this is not a 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:10.000
 I hit the game but I did not hit here. 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:13.230
 wake her up next to the trailer box 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.710
 some place here does not stay in her hand 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.920
 very solid base I'm not much 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.190
 fan to leave the one that has many state 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.890
 mainly of drawing but even 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.720
 well worth the price of the promotion in the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:35.650
 amazon in general everything is very beautiful is 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.960
 different from the version of Europe but is not 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.010
 bad is a detail here O combat 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.270

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:26.259
