going to show you how to draw a concept

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.890 
going to show you how to draw a concept
car<00:00:10.490> nice<00:00:11.490> thing<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.759> concept<00:00:12.450> cars<00:00:12.660> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
car nice thing about concept cars is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.480 
car nice thing about concept cars is
that<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.170> could<00:00:13.349> totally<00:00:14.009> use<00:00:14.040> your

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
that you could totally use your

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
that you could totally use your
imagination<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.109> we're<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> start<00:00:16.650> off

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
imagination so we're going to start off

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.910 
imagination so we're going to start off
with<00:00:17.000> squiggle<00:00:18.000> line<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> top<00:00:18.920> then

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
with squiggle line for the top then

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.349 
with squiggle line for the top then
we're<00:00:20.039> going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> come<00:00:20.520> down<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.820> box<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
we're going to come down and box out the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.910 
we're going to come down and box out the
back<00:00:25.039> let<00:00:26.039> me<00:00:26.160> put<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> little<00:00:26.630> exhausting<00:00:27.920> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
back let me put a little exhausting and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.240 
back let me put a little exhausting and
come<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.500> think<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.619> should<00:00:31.650> leave<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> little

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
come in I think we should leave a little

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.870 
come in I think we should leave a little
space<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.420> tires<00:00:34.100> come<00:00:35.100> around<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
space here for the tires come around and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
space here for the tires come around and
let's<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:36.719> how's<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.320> front<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.739> car

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
let's see how's the front of this car

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.400 
let's see how's the front of this car
going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> look<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:39.899> come<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
going to look I think it should come to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
going to look I think it should come to
kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> point<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.210> be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
kind of more of a point that would be

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.350 
kind of more of a point that would be
kind<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.690> cool<00:00:43.309> all<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.120> we're<00:00:45.210> going

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
kind of cool all right then we're going

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
kind of cool all right then we're going
to<00:00:45.420> come<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> line<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
to come in and do a line for the top of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
to come in and do a line for the top of
the<00:00:47.309> car<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.329> windshield<00:00:50.480> maybe<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.690> can

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the car and the windshield maybe we can

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.889 
the car and the windshield maybe we can
add<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.320> window<00:00:52.739> back<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.329> by

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
add a little window back in here just by

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.979 
add a little window back in here just by
drawing<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.350> long<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:56.309> triangle<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:59.989> then

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
drawing a long little triangle and then

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.390 
drawing a long little triangle and then
we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.530> put<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.920> some<00:01:02.480> wheels

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
we're going to just put in some wheels

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.620 
we're going to just put in some wheels
put<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.909> front<00:01:06.360> wheel<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:07.080> here

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
put in a little front wheel over here

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
put in a little front wheel over here
another<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:10.020> half<00:01:10.229> circle<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
another little half circle and then a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.130 
another little half circle and then a
circle<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> tire<00:01:14.600> we<00:01:15.600> might<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
circle for the tire we might want to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
circle for the tire we might want to
come<00:01:16.320> around<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.100> put<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.400> bit

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.380 
come around and just put a little bit
more<00:01:18.360> detail<00:01:19.250> just<00:01:20.250> by<00:01:20.520> adding<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.000> few<00:01:21.210> little

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
more detail just by adding a few little

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
more detail just by adding a few little
lines<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.470> add<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.729> line<00:01:27.030> here

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
lines and add one more little line here

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.069 
lines and add one more little line here
and<00:01:28.579> then<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> side<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> car<00:01:30.509> we'll

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and then on the side of the car we'll

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.719 
and then on the side of the car we'll
just<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.470> our<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.799> lines<00:01:32.210> for<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> doors

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
just do our little lines for the doors

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.030 
just do our little lines for the doors
maybe<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:35.880> door<00:01:36.329> handle<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.079> think<00:01:37.920> we

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
maybe a little door handle I think we

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440 
maybe a little door handle I think we
need<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> put<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.640> cool<00:01:38.909> racing<00:01:39.240> stripes

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
need to put some cool racing stripes

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
need to put some cool racing stripes
across<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.290> car<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> nice

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
across the car so we can just do a nice

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
across the car so we can just do a nice
long<00:01:42.000> stroke<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.460> can

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
long stroke like this and you can

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
long stroke like this and you can
picture<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.149> line<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.320> cool<00:01:49.500> red

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
picture this line in a really cool red

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.990 
picture this line in a really cool red
or<00:01:50.159> green<00:01:50.600> racing<00:01:51.600> stripe<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.520> think<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
or green racing stripe now I think this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.050 
or green racing stripe now I think this
part<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.540> should<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.840> all<00:01:55.049> glass<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.460> maybe

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
part here should be all glass so maybe

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
part here should be all glass so maybe
we<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:58.049> little<00:01:58.259> quick<00:01:58.649> lines

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
we can just put some little quick lines

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.550 
we can just put some little quick lines
across<00:01:59.369> here<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.869> show<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.180> glass

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
across here to show that this is glass

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.520 
across here to show that this is glass
see<00:02:04.560> how<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.329> little<00:02:06.329> few<00:02:06.570> lines<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
see how just little few lines here and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.619 
see how just little few lines here and
just<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.009> little<00:02:08.280> bit<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.670> shadow<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.450> can

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
just a little bit of shadow you can

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.570 
just a little bit of shadow you can
almost<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> looks<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.280> glass

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
almost see that that looks like glass

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.050 
almost see that that looks like glass
and<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.170> should

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and now I think we should

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.050 
and now I think we should
bring<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.420> front<00:02:15.780> grill<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.730> add<00:02:17.730> some

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
bring out this front grill and add some

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.390 
bring out this front grill and add some
lines<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.930> create<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.530> grill<00:02:19.770> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
lines to it to create the grill and
