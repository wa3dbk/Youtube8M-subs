00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
hi my name is Karen Hoffa and we're

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.900 
hi my name is Karen Hoffa and we're
going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.470> be<00:00:04.589> talking<00:00:04.799> about<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.310> new<00:00:05.490> M

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
going to be talking about the new M

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.450 
going to be talking about the new M

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
cloth cloth the new cloth simulation for

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:22.520 
cloth cloth the new cloth simulation for
2013<00:00:11.460> 3<00:00:11.880> study<00:00:12.179> max<00:00:15.289> let's<00:00:16.289> create<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.650> box

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.710 

a<00:00:22.730> rectangle<00:00:24.350> roughly<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.530> so<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.970> then

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
a rectangle roughly like so and then

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
a rectangle roughly like so and then
we'll<00:00:28.260> copy<00:00:28.530> that<00:00:28.800> rectangle<00:00:29.400> over<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:32.270> we'll

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
we'll copy that rectangle over and we'll

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.700 
we'll copy that rectangle over and we'll
move<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.660> both<00:00:34.550> above<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.700> ground<00:00:35.940> plane

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
move them both above the ground plane

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
move them both above the ground plane
now<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.130> turn<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.460> AutoKey<00:00:39.290> because

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
now I'm going to turn on AutoKey because

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.100 
now I'm going to turn on AutoKey because
we're<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> simulate<00:00:40.920> tearing<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.930> in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
we're going to simulate tearing and in

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.530 
we're going to simulate tearing and in
the<00:00:43.200> last<00:00:43.440> frame<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> pull<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
the last frame I'm going to pull this

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:56.060 
the last frame I'm going to pull this
box<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.380> way

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.430 

so<00:00:57.070> now<00:00:57.310> I'll<00:00:57.880> create<00:00:58.240> a<00:00:58.300> plane<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.230> top

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
so now I'll create a plane in the top

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:15.420 
so now I'll create a plane in the top
viewport<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.260> then<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:06.400> going<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.430> as

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
viewport and then I'm going to and as

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:24.320 
viewport and then I'm going to and as
before<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:18.250> going<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.580> add<00:01:18.790> my<00:01:20.460> modify<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:22.440> now

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
before I'm going to add my modify it now

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.350 
before I'm going to add my modify it now
I'll<00:01:25.330> select<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.960> vertices<00:01:26.259> at<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.910> edges<00:01:28.240> of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
I'll select the vertices at the edges of

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.950 
I'll select the vertices at the edges of
of<00:01:28.600> one<00:01:28.930> edge<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.530> box<00:01:32.190> click<00:01:33.190> on<00:01:33.840> click<00:01:34.840> on

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
of one edge of the box click on click on

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.520 
of one edge of the box click on click on
make<00:01:35.320> group<00:01:35.770> I'm<00:01:36.670> going<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.090> call<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.530> side

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
make group I'm going to call this side

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.660 
make group I'm going to call this side
and<00:01:40.200> instead<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.259> pen<00:01:41.680> I'm<00:01:41.979> going<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.399> use<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
and instead of pen I'm going to use the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.510 
and instead of pen I'm going to use the
note<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.360> note<00:01:43.600> will<00:01:43.990> listen<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:45.070> see<00:01:45.250> how<00:01:45.369> my

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
note the note will listen you see how my

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.510 
note the note will listen you see how my
cursor<00:01:45.759> has<00:01:46.660> changed<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:47.259> a<00:01:47.290> picker<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.280> note

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
cursor has changed to a picker the note

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.670 
cursor has changed to a picker the note
will<00:01:48.759> listen<00:01:48.940> for<00:01:49.119> which<00:01:49.869> object<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.470> click

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
will listen for which object you click

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.060 
will listen for which object you click
on<00:01:50.800> next<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.369> I've<00:01:52.300> clicked<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.810> this<00:01:53.020> box<00:01:53.320> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
on next and I've clicked on this box so

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.510 
on next and I've clicked on this box so
now<00:01:54.340> these<00:01:55.180> vertices<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.860> simulation

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
now these vertices in the simulation

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.080 
now these vertices in the simulation
will<00:01:57.820> follow<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.690> sparks<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:02.110> you'll<00:02:02.320> notice

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
will follow the sparks as you'll notice

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.219 
will follow the sparks as you'll notice
if<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.479> run<00:02:05.350> simulate<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.420> vertices<00:02:07.750> are<00:02:08.080> now

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
if I run simulate the vertices are now

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.420 
if I run simulate the vertices are now
attached<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.030> box<00:02:10.299> and<00:02:11.100> it's<00:02:12.100> been

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
attached to that box and it's been

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.750 
attached to that box and it's been
pulled<00:02:12.790> by<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:14.080> on<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> other<00:02:14.500> side<00:02:14.760> learn

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
pulled by it now on the other side learn

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.990 
pulled by it now on the other side learn
to<00:02:15.880> do<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> same<00:02:16.330> thing<00:02:17.670> grab<00:02:18.670> these<00:02:18.970> vertices

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
to do the same thing grab these vertices

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:41.140 
to do the same thing grab these vertices
make<00:02:22.000> group<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:27.100> note<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.860> school

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.740 

now<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.770> run<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> simulation<00:02:44.480> will<00:02:45.480> see

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
now if we run the simulation will see

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.680 
now if we run the simulation will see
that<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> cloth<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.950> being<00:02:47.510> kind<00:02:48.510> of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
that the cloth is being kind of

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.340 
that the cloth is being kind of
stretched<00:02:49.320> by<00:02:49.680> both<00:02:49.920> sides<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.270> notice<00:02:51.780> how

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
stretched by both sides but notice how

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.730 
stretched by both sides but notice how
the<00:02:53.250> center<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.150> being<00:02:54.570> stretched<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.110> lot<00:02:55.350> less

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
the center is being stretched a lot less

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.180 
the center is being stretched a lot less
than<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.030> outer<00:02:57.210> versus<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
than the outer versus this because the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
than the outer versus this because the
cloth<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.820> set<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.830> zero<00:03:01.830> stretchiness<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
cloth is set to zero stretchiness so to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.800 
cloth is set to zero stretchiness so to
fix<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.700> headset<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.730> stretchiness<00:03:06.420> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
fix that headset that stretchiness to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.010 
fix that headset that stretchiness to
zero<00:03:07.080> point<00:03:07.350> maybe<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:11.990> rerun<00:03:12.990> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
zero point maybe and rerun the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.840 
zero point maybe and rerun the
simulation<00:03:13.290> you'll<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> stretch

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
simulation you'll see that this stretch

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.300 
simulation you'll see that this stretch
is<00:03:15.090> now<00:03:15.270> occurring<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.260> much<00:03:16.500> more<00:03:16.740> natural

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
is now occurring in a much more natural

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.660 
is now occurring in a much more natural
fashion<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.900> addition<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.800> we<00:03:23.490> don't

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
fashion in addition to that we don't

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.210 
fashion in addition to that we don't
want<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.510> stiff<00:03:24.959> when<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.950> actually

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
want it to be so stiff when it actually

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.580 
want it to be so stiff when it actually
rips<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.630> we're<00:03:27.840> going<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:28.140> turn<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.680> to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.400 

so<00:03:34.590> now<00:03:34.970> we're<00:03:35.970> going<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.209> make<00:03:36.390> us<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.780> third

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
so now we're going to make us a third

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.009 
so now we're going to make us a third
group<00:03:38.250> which<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.030> really<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.690> tear

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
group which is really a tear

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
the vertices and we made a tear

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.270 
the vertices and we made a tear
