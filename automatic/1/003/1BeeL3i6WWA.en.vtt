00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.070
 his parents are purely episode of pink 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 comics in today's episode 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.609
 Let's get involved again 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.779
 a jubilee story because don pink 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 has more often from egmont 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 or from its publisher 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.670
 or until the department heads no idea 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.109
 at ericsson get the order 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.460
 to draw boys' stories 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.500
 for example, to those starting from 60 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 birthday or the gustav fiftieth 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.230
 birthday later also to yours 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 operation 50 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 and now is the most important story 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 has ever been told by the indios 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 because known as uncle Dagobert 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.510
 yes a great deep 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 and then of course it was one of her 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 pass to the uncle dagobert want the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.230
 Anniversary namely its fiftieth 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.239
 birthday in quotation marks one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.859
 to write history 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.960
 Of course you can not say exactly 150 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.879
 years old known that at least 80 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.799
 So he has to do something else 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.170
 how do you come up with this 50? 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.400
 pack this number for a jubilee 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.299
 I know and I want to do that well 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.580
 his stories play in the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.130
 fifties live according to his operation 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.530
 your billionth story is okay 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.619
 but come in january 2 home 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.330
 So 952 50 years in duckhausen and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.590
 That's just how we have that famous one 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.720
 golden anniversary 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.509
 Of course the question is how should that be 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.450
 celebrate because normally is not for 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.360
 celebrate and 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.340
 such crafts come, then 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.799
 weird mysterious sponsor of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.079
 outside of just this celebration to her 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.399
 wants to align company world and has just 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.700
 also started a competition right away 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.039
 Namely man starts to guess what 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.450
 Uncle Dagobert's biggest wish is so 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.880
 what would he do for the fiftieth? 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.509
 wish golden jubilee and that 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.460
 problem is that because of this this 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.110
 everything stops at once 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.759
 because the heart world of course know 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.530
 what is also great with abos and wish 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.670
 everyone is constantly thinking and thinking about it 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.959
 in the house or any collectors 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.840
 figures and so on 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.519
 and he was really precisely the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.660
 whole economy in the city because 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.549
 all somewhere behind this one 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.620
 million dollars 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.959
 therefore they are advertised for 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.000
 this competition 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.910
 this is the hanger of history what 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.700
 behind it is a nasty tactic of 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.170
 equal to three chambers association quasi 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.650
 in total there are a few more 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 corner 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.670
 if you take the number of people namely 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.560
 dagoberts largest unite for the first time 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.889
 one by the panzerknacker then 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.859
 gundel gaukeley and mettmann i sec because 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.120
 this unequal team has the powers 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.700
 founded and teamed around 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.269
 finally has to do it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.160
 also like the crooks at one 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.630
 conspiratorial meet in a new 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.069
 setting which is the first time here 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.500
 is introduced namely the old 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.560
 duckhausen what deep below today 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.630
 City is later was a two times 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.130
 Anyway , the rogue is in 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.010
 Meet this conspiratorial 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.459
 Hide a little is a perfidious 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.260
 Plan namely that have determined that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.829
 the goals of the individual are not 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.239
 contradict 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.709
 because I have the panzerknacker him 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.859
 julia roberts course assets 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.410
 just want to have a small first sentence 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.769
 passed tough big pause kaka 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.599
 are 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.819
 Leave it to the concert 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.090
 and with manni sec do not want to and 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.379
 could 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.030
 who have money, I just want to 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.560
 rooney to what happened to it, of course 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.220
 if that were the panzerknacker and jude law 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.319
 is it supposed to be favorite to take yes for 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.780
 content and already have a bit 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.730
 what the backgrounds told this 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.950
 history is in my opinion of 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.160
 the jubilee stories actually the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.290
 best because she is very and she has one 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.730
 extremely interesting threat namely 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.459
 actually this constellation 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.200
 that these crooks all work together 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.870
 that has just been rich 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.299
 this is something new and the whole team 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.160
 station running because all farmers 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.209
 combine naturally or bundle 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.760
 Of course, here too the most important ones 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.620
 In particular , their strengths remain good 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.959
 funny in front of standards because there is one 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.280
 convertible died before tankbuster 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.319
 Family duck transforms them 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.549
 can creep into money spokesman 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.019
 and the most bizarre thing about this story 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.350
 is that this somehow died wet 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.600
 is or has against high value in any case 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.460
 he almost a malfunction and that provides 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.090
 then for a very bizarre hall 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.240
 panzerknacker and half-fare there is one 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.690
 scene where somebody actually somehow 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.310
 below without obviously occurs because 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.300
 superficially faints as me 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.240
 namely one of the panzerknacker 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.979
 turned back and there gustav goose 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.099
 was and just keeps his clothes 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.710
 this broken wand is the 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.680
 suspect without because we know that 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.750
 dax and gustav do not wear roses 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.270
 Everything fit early enough that you are the 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.710
 all the time wear clothes just above 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.320
 and some time and without running around 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.090
 Well, and the armored cops harmless and 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.680
 obviously, they do not just own pants 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.690
 but I do not want that now either 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.340
 say that is not fall over everyone 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.020
 very bizarre case that alluded to it 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.430
 Without that, that's exactly what he was 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.410
 you will only see that from 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.930
 a reddish fainting falls and one 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.040
 but can be 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.490
 and otherwise as I said a very 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.710
 beautiful story with the copy index 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.780
 with big threats or cracks too 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.480
 again and again after my time and 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.480
 it was smooth from me 5
