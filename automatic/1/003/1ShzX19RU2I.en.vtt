rice pudding so it's a case of take it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.500 
rice pudding so it's a case of take it
off<00:00:29.189> straight<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:32.300> basically<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
off straight out basically what you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
unit sealed and then you just take

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.060 
unit sealed and then you just take
everything<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.449> I've<00:00:57.660> done<00:00:58.070> ya

one up 11.1 1800 milliamp so cuz I've
checked<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.549> motor<00:02:02.759> apparently<00:02:03.509> 6<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
checked with the motor apparently 6 to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.100 
checked with the motor apparently 6 to
18<00:02:04.380> bolt<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.390> it'll<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:06.689> what's<00:02:06.990> the
