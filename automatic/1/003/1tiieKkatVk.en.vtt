 competition to all pilots who 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.440
 we like to walk on earth it would be 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.950
 it's something we have to do 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.950
 yes 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.270
 francisco in am is a pilot with 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.070
 experience in the world of rally but 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.049
 has been a student of first at 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.909
 teachings of jose the greatest flowers and 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.390
 enrique murillo who already know what 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.220
 is to run in a low 1000 look what we have 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 been commenting a lot he has been 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.740
 missing two months three of this because 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.740
 the maguana 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.630
 has marked well I have told you that no 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.870
 can go very close to the cars in that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.580
 area or in the area of ​​the Balkans that 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.170
 are the critical areas 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.840
 Well, I think I learned 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.600
 a lot of them have taught me a lot 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.490
 as I told them that the only thing that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.610
 You can buy it even if you have all the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.040
 budget is the experience is a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:12.150
 very technical very fast pilot will learn 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.070
 fast what is it about the guy 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.890
 of us what I look for in 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.820
 this competition is not so much to demonstrate 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.160
 nothing but acquire experience so that 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.780
 later yes you can be 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.880
 fighting to know where I am that that is 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.770
 also something that calls me a lot 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.050
 attention to know what level I am against 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.050
 the fast riders in this category 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.849
 we have to have a clean career without 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.050
 punctures and without mechanical problems 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.370
 what can stop us and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.370
 surely we have focusing between the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.489
 first 10 places this voice is the key 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.610
 and that's what we've been discussing 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.790
 we have prepared our areas well 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.560
 we are logistically fine 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.480
 located there will be no problems 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.520
 this competition would not have been possible 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.610
 without the support of all of our 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.630

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.280
