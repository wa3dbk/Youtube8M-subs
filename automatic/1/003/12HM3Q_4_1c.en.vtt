00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.150
 today 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 then this map that is the initial map is 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:53.189

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.239

 this map when I downloaded it was not 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.540
 Verde so I'll leave that node 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:41.239

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:55.190
 point higher than the lowest point 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:59.930
 careful not to get into the other 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.900
 bar and one that will pop up a low block 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.850
 you can do the marking is 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.470

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.040
 ax sure I left it but also 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:34.790
 the map side of the arena select the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:42.709
 lowest point now you see it goes 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:50.120

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:57.769
 pontinha and now again powder and here 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:00.680

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.739
 this you will see on each island 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.840
 I usually check it out, I already 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.190
 I mentioned it and then take a block that 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.140
 anyone paying the gold itself here 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.130
 and put where we will mark the face 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.549
 more serious 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.630
 so let's mark it here so close 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.720
 Bauru 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.479
 So you go from the sws propeller bar paulo 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.350
 put one foot on it only 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.420
 for you to know 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.370
 already added and this is what is a is a 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.470
 map of eight people in the then 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:48.740
 will give this command eight times 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:50.870
 we put it here and you mark all the neo 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.920
 I'm just going to score 3 the team she does not take 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.480
 long then after that you already 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.700
 set everything up 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:05.510
 You just need to put the items in the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:08.900
 trunk then make 11 more differentiated 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:21.980
 possible not be the same items but 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:24.230
 also not being something much to gain so 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.190
 ok then you put the same materials 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.440
 for each neighborhood and will also modify 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.130
 all chests after you modify all 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.030
 the chests want these blocks is that you just 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.210
 Used to score and will give a bar 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.170
 ws know 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:52.100
 ready after that you go there in the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:06:00.440
 your shuttle brain here in Cannes and 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:02.210
 me and sky wars will come in bloom arenas 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.310
 wardian wars 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.400
 I chose because this is that area in the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.920
 base with the hangu team 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:18.470
 here you click on name and copy the name 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:21.620

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:30.400
 sky wars and sky bloch wars 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:35.410
 then you glue django and closes safely 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.410
 Now you're ringing on Saturday. 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.920

 configured already then it's right, right? 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.160
 Another personal thing I threw the 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.670
 money is that person you kill 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.950
 you earn a thousand of money and every time 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.630
 that you win a match of if you fell 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.240
 or if you 're going to win 10,000 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.980
 you can change these values ​​or 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.820
 just in case you do not want this 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.650
 typing that false close and save and not 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:47.300
 I will save neither because I like this 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:50.450
 so I'll let fashion save this 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.420
