 rather, itâ€™s just a demonstration 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 picking and some thoughts about 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.849

 that you can install thousands 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.500
 additional provisions so let's see 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.500
 what is included with this device 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.070
 directly the tablet itself 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:43.630
 read for mounting on the car 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:47.230

 car charging cable for 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.240
 connect computers micro usb 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.290
 the arrival of cameras on the connection of external 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:12.920
 devices such as more g modems and 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.660
 similar and there is also such 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.920
 tablet contain before fixing 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.790
 the car on the keep exactly the panel 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.790
 the car 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:43.450
 steel used for fixing and nipples 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:46.650
 like this 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.650
 used as a stand 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.320
 body control device 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.330

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.590
 micro sd format memory into slot and here 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:28.920
 micro hdmi connector micro usb charger 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:32.950
 device from which to control 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:38.250
 rear of the camera is located 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.250
 2 megapixel resolution and speaker 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:46.030
 of which sounds are called front 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.210
 the panel also has a camera eye 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.700
 2 megapixel resolution 4 touch 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.510
 keys and is typical for all other 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.790
 devices and the screen itself 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.350
 seven-inch 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.320
 built can reproduce 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.570
 videos with resolution up to 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.860
 1080p 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.840
 what I think is a pretty good kit 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.880
 devices also included 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.150
 pre-installed software 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.430
 security 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.770
 when navigating and for dvr 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.380
 but there is such a feature in demand that 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.330
 mount very thoughtfully if its 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.550
 mounted on the windshield itself 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.360
 mount closing racing camcorder and 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.890
 it's almost impossible to use it 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.990
 so you have to use a pill 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.780
 for mounting the device on the panel 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.400
 car then again is always comfortable 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.400
 can go 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.500
 spoil remember sticky tape and so 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.960
 only have to use it 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.670
 quality navigator program navigator 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.080
 which is included 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:11.650
 causes I collect dps was she doesn't have 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.650
 cards they have cards 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.380
 the manufacturer offers the opportunity 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.900
 download free map but use 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.440
 it can only be in my for 30 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:29.360
 days it is treated by the installation of health 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.130
 software such as all 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.810
 are known 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:37.160
 Navitel or SitiGid well yeah right 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.890
 free all these programs work on 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:46.640
 she device what else to say 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.280
 the device is pretty smart also in 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.580
 addition can say that it has 512 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.720
 megabytes of RAM and 8 gigabytes 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.000
 built-in memory card drive 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.920
 memory is supported up to 32 and 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.910
 dig that is the prince is a memory 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.960
 pretty clever novel you connect also 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.690
 there is a built-in fm-transmitter 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.450
 which allows you to transmit sound 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.420
 signal to the radio frequency which you 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.840
 can put a man 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:23.150
 however the range of this transmitter 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.880
 rather limited so better 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.510
 Use is necessary so that the device 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.460
 there was a close container so but in 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.200
 principle of course strictly pretty pretty 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.040
 Conveniently, as if the sizo receiver is audible 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.310
 exactly how do you produce neuruses and 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.450
 teams 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:46.550
 innovation programs also device 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:51.190
 supports connecting external 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:54.710
 the device is like a usb keyboard and 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.020
 mouse that is via usb host when you can 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.780
 connect this device 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:09.060
 use 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:12.450
 do pansha as a laptop that's the principle 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.580
 all that this device by 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.090
 performance 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.419
 I will say that pretty good build descent 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:23.220
 similar characteristics to many 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.830
 specialized gps-navigator even 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.389
 never dreamed 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.990
 thanks for watching thanks for watching 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.990
 bye everyone
