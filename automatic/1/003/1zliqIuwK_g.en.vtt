00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 sean penn is known as 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.750
 character actor but here he is 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.440
 the deadly agent the meadow can be 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.200
 now for you sean penn plays here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.990
 special forces agent jim of the year 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.670
 2006 a deadly assassination exercise 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.109
 had to and this not only haunts him 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.960
 today in dreams and thoughts 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.269
 but eight years later in the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 reality and he has to do just that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.500
 from that time on there are some 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 places and also at some places 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 very painful as the whole looks 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.130
 and like sean penn as a ship fund 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.130
 agent acts that somebody 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.780
 I did bad things 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.360
 tell me about it we thought we would 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.410
 help 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.410
 but we were wrong 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 you will do the shot that is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.350
 the biggest mistake of my life has 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.229
 An unknown offender released bloody 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.530
 Conflicts and a growing humanitarian 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.530
 disaster 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.759
 Jim, why are you trying on someone here 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.759
 to kill me 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.130
 the companies are just up 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.240
 you need it to cover so on 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.499
 you just make too many thoughts 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.329
 something is already past 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.460
 Past friends of our mission 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.069
 never existed 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.219
 is that clear texte play games with 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.219
 me 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.659
 we have heard you have information 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.560
 what kind of information 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.050
 I have names data 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.150
 I recorded everything 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.780
 I will publish it all 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.780
 world should see it 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.190
 that start soon 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.960
 you already have to standpoint of the company 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.850
 appearance 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.009
 you are the last big threat to 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.280
 then there is nothing left for us 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.280
 discuss 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.770
 she betrayed me 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.770
 they would have a great try 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.849
 In principle, I find it very exciting 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.159
 if really these character actors 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.170
 sometimes slip into other roles like that 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.390
 I had two concerts for example 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.799
 very amusing that he at kings one up 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.599
 a lot of people themselves 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.250
 killed than not that up 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.409
 bring for themselves and therefore not for 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.040
 on this approach already penal zone role 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.470
 to stick 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 very brave and interesting and 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.870
 of course it has acting as well 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.209
 on it and that's what you do on everyone 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.159
 falling at even that he will be crafts 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.409
 mastered and because I know exactly what he 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.480
 Unfortunately, history does it 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.430
 but not him too the corresponding one 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.560
 give environment for it is this 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.709
 not only boring and very boring 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.209
 straightforward but totally predictable 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.430
 stand alone really stupid 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.079
 the thing is, that's all 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 actually minor if you say so 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.599
 okay the film has a certain tempo 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.180
 or films somehow exciting 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.709
 he has a certain red thread he 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.579
 then you can track over quite a few 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.260
 to overlook things 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.760
 you can not even do that with one 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.799
 was really on the every two minutes 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.180
 watch looks and actually thinks the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.440
 rules that now again so do yet 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.510
 Sometime now somehow come out 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.819
 the quark at the same time is the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.400
 opponent javier bardem the sky full 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.440
 quite outstanding that has shown 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.190
 here he is like a comic-like figure 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.310
 the very strange speak the very strange 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.139
 Acts and he overacting poses as 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.819
 really a danger so you know 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.889
 actually from the first second on what 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.230
 about happened on the next problem 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.290
 At the same time , you know something super predictable 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.379
 but also relatively quickly every time 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.889
 So a spot is established 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.060
 OK 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.310
 The action will now be in the next 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.680
 take place ten minutes there, you know 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.230
 exactly like the clever thing out there 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.840
 I'll just go say at the end you see 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.129
 also as far as I know in the advertising material 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.010
 There is also a scene in a stadium 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.669
 with staring so because you can 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.560
 maybe imagine how about there 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.760
 died as well as the people of the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.949
 film is really very weak 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.260
 does not bring tension to the point 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.060
 History is Moorish achievement 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.620
 by sean penn solid but overall 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.900
 that really flutters this way and that 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.479
 that you are bored and that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.400
 Nasebhren more exciting is included 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.020
 result as the final 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.300
 That's why there's a movie from me 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.669
 Although for nice look and sean penn 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.259
 three out of ten points but reached the 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.880
 I was really very weak 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:52.240
 disappointed and worth my time 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.240
 not to buy a movie ticket for
