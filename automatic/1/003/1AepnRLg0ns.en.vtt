00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this game play i'm actually using a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
this game play i'm actually using a
different<00:00:36.870> killstreak<00:00:37.410> setup<00:00:37.860> than<00:00:38.100> most

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
different killstreak setup than most

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
different killstreak setup than most
people<00:00:38.760> would<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.000> using<00:00:39.420> i<00:00:39.510> am<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> lower<00:00:39.870> level

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
people would be using i am a lower level

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.950 
people would be using i am a lower level
in<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.469> game<00:00:40.649> play<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.100> don't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
in this game play so they don't have the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
in this game play so they don't have the
Blackbird<00:00:42.960> swarm<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> puppies<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> I'm

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
Blackbird swarm or the puppies so I'm

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
Blackbird swarm or the puppies so I'm
using<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> lightning<00:00:46.559> strike<00:00:46.850> loadstar<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
using the lightning strike loadstar and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260 
using the lightning strike loadstar and
the<00:00:48.090> VTOL<00:00:48.390> warship<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:50.010> 138<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> no

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the VTOL warship and I do go 138 and no

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
the VTOL warship and I do go 138 and no
and<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.870> big<00:00:52.140> part<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.680> pulling<00:00:53.340> off

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and I think a big part of pulling off

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
and I think a big part of pulling off
this<00:00:53.699> flawless<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.420> having<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> two

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
this flawless was having the two

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
this flawless was having the two
unmanned<00:00:55.890> kills<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.520> mean<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> two-man

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
unmanned kills I mean the two-man

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
unmanned kills I mean the two-man
killstreaks<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.649> i<00:00:58.680> had<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> find<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.250> spot<00:00:59.460> lay

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
killstreaks so i had to find a spot lay

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
killstreaks so i had to find a spot lay
down<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> hide<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:00.899> killstreaks

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
down and hide and use those killstreaks

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.500 
down and hide and use those killstreaks
which<00:01:02.070> i<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.250> helped<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> wasn't

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
which i think helped because it wasn't

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
which i think helped because it wasn't
leaving<00:01:03.750> me<00:01:03.870> vulnerable<00:01:04.110> i<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.949> outside<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
leaving me vulnerable i was outside and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
leaving me vulnerable i was outside and
I<00:01:06.150> mean<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> hiding<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.040> hard

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I mean I was a hiding and so it was hard

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
I mean I was a hiding and so it was hard
for<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> enemies<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> find<00:01:09.060> me<00:01:09.180> since<00:01:09.360> I'd

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for the enemies to find me since I'd

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
for the enemies to find me since I'd
ghost<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.680> helped

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
ghost on and I think that really helped

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
ghost on and I think that really helped
me<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> flawless<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.390> maybe<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
me get this flawless I think maybe if I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.260 
me get this flawless I think maybe if I
would<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:12.960> ran<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.520> swarm<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
would have ran around with the swarm and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.370 
would have ran around with the swarm and
the<00:01:15.360> dogs<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> air<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.200> would've<00:01:16.350> been

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the dogs in the air there would've been

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.190 
the dogs in the air there would've been
a<00:01:16.500> bigger<00:01:16.710> possibility<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.580> Mia<00:01:17.790> me<00:01:18.509> dying<00:01:18.780> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a bigger possibility of Mia me dying but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
a bigger possibility of Mia me dying but
so<00:01:20.130> yeah<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.210> good

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
so yeah I think it's a pretty good

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
so yeah I think it's a pretty good

always<00:01:43.110> always<00:01:43.560> use<00:01:43.920> fast<00:01:44.189> mags<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
always always use fast mags because the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.319 
always always use fast mags because the
clip<00:01:45.360> size<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.750> big<00:01:45.960> anyways<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.149> some<00:01:48.149> other

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
clip size is big anyways and some other

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.740 
clip size is big anyways and some other
guns<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> MSMC<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.790> vector<00:01:51.180> i'll

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
guns like the MSMC or the vector i'll

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.440 
guns like the MSMC or the vector i'll
probably<00:01:51.960> use<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.290> fat<00:01:53.220> extended<00:01:54.090> max<00:01:54.240> because

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
probably use a fat extended max because

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.380 
probably use a fat extended max because
i<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.780> smaller<00:01:55.049> clip<00:01:55.320> size<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.390> one

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
i do have a smaller clip size but one

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
i do have a smaller clip size but one
thing<00:01:57.689> i<00:01:57.930> don't<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.310> extended

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
thing i don't really like about extended

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
thing i don't really like about extended
mags<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.600> real<00:02:00.930> Oh<00:02:01.049> time<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.320> pretty<00:02:01.740> slow

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
mags is the real Oh time is pretty slow

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.190 
mags is the real Oh time is pretty slow
and<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> submachine<00:02:03.000> gun<00:02:03.420> you're<00:02:03.990> running

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and with a submachine gun you're running

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.840 
and with a submachine gun you're running
around<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
around and you really do want that a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.789 
around and you really do want that a
quick<00:02:06.149> reload<00:02:06.540> time<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.020> case<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.350> run<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
quick reload time in case you run it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.109 
quick reload time in case you run it
because<00:02:08.039> you're<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> enemies<00:02:08.610> spawn<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
because you're in the enemies spawn and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
because you're in the enemies spawn and
you<00:02:09.599> don't<00:02:09.869> wanna<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:10.500> want<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.860> have

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you don't wanna you don't want to have

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.559 
you don't wanna you don't want to have

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
to reload slow and die while you're

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.360 
to reload slow and die while you're
reloading<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.230> I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
reloading because I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.970 
reloading because I
be<00:02:13.459> really<00:02:13.670> unfortunate<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:15.769> definitely

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
be really unfortunate and you definitely

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.589 
be really unfortunate and you definitely
want<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.340> get<00:02:16.459> those<00:02:16.640> those<00:02:16.909> killstreaks<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
want to get those those killstreaks and

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.350 
want to get those those killstreaks and
dying<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.769> not<00:02:19.159> a<00:02:19.340> very<00:02:19.580> good<00:02:19.610> thing<00:02:19.790> so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
dying is not a very good thing so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.130 
dying is not a very good thing so
anyways<00:02:21.110> my<00:02:21.590> secondary<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.610> 57<00:02:23.330> which<00:02:23.870> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
anyways my secondary is the 57 which is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.570 
anyways my secondary is the 57 which is
pretty<00:02:24.379> irrelevant<00:02:24.739> in<00:02:25.159> this<00:02:25.340> gameplay

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
pretty irrelevant in this gameplay

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.089 
pretty irrelevant in this gameplay
considering<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.330> don't<00:02:26.659> even<00:02:26.810> use<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.470> don't

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
considering I don't even use it I don't

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.550 
considering I don't even use it I don't
use<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.519> secondary<00:02:28.940> at<00:02:29.659> all<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.260> I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
use the secondary at all and I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.770 
use the secondary at all and I
personally<00:02:31.129> I'm<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.700> really<00:02:31.909> fan<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.360> big

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
personally I'm not a really fan a big

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.780 
personally I'm not a really fan a big
fan<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.019> using<00:02:33.290> secondaries<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.040> never<00:02:34.519> end<00:02:34.730> up

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
fan of using secondaries I never end up

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.309 
fan of using secondaries I never end up
using<00:02:34.940> them<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.299> much<00:02:35.390> anyways<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.079> I'll

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
using them that much anyways so I'll

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.190 
using them that much anyways so I'll
normally<00:02:36.769> use<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.549> six<00:02:37.579> perks<00:02:38.209> or<00:02:38.450> something

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
normally use like six perks or something

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.449 
normally use like six perks or something
like<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.349> but<00:02:39.739> like<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.159> said<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.400> this

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
like that but like I said in this

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.949 
like that but like I said in this
gameplay<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.819> wasn't<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> very<00:02:41.209> high<00:02:41.390> level<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:41.930> I

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
gameplay I wasn't a very high level so I

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.890 
gameplay I wasn't a very high level so I
didn't<00:02:42.230> have<00:02:42.349> too<00:02:42.620> many<00:02:42.739> options<00:02:43.599> my<00:02:44.599> perks

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
didn't have too many options my perks

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.720 
didn't have too many options my perks
were<00:02:45.349> hard<00:02:46.250> line<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:48.430> hard<00:02:49.430> line<00:02:49.579> and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
were hard line and hard line and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.280 
were hard line and hard line and
something<00:02:50.000> else<00:02:50.030> i<00:02:50.150> did<00:02:50.329> not<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.660> ghost<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.260> i

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
something else i did not have ghost so i

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.569 
something else i did not have ghost so i
think<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.650> might<00:02:51.769> have<00:02:51.859> been<00:02:51.950> hard<00:02:52.160> line<00:02:52.310> flak

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579

spawning<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.780> get<00:03:27.049> that<00:03:27.169> flank<00:03:27.500> route<00:03:27.739> and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
spawning I get that flank route and

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.500 
spawning I get that flank route and
you're<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:28.700> close<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:29.090> getting<00:03:29.209> all<00:03:29.419> those

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
you're so close to getting all those

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.629 
you're so close to getting all those
kills<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.680> killed<00:03:31.069> climbing<00:03:31.519> in<00:03:31.609> the

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
kills but you get killed climbing in the

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.860 
kills but you get killed climbing in the
window<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.209> don't<00:03:32.359> have<00:03:32.389> dexterity

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
window because you don't have dexterity

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.960 
window because you don't have dexterity
and<00:03:33.079> it's<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.799> pretty<00:03:34.010> slow<00:03:34.340> reload<00:03:34.730> time

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
and it's a pretty slow reload time

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.809 
and it's a pretty slow reload time
that's<00:03:35.900> pretty<00:03:36.049> slow<00:03:36.349> climb<00:03:36.590> time<00:03:36.859> so<00:03:37.250> yeah

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
that's pretty slow climb time so yeah

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.819 
that's pretty slow climb time so yeah
that's<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.510> mean<00:03:38.599> that's<00:03:38.660> one<00:03:38.989> problem<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.530> find

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
that's I mean that's one problem I find

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.129 
that's I mean that's one problem I find
with<00:03:40.099> not<00:03:40.400> using<00:03:40.430> dexterity<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:42.019> you

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
with not using dexterity is that you

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.110 
with not using dexterity is that you
tend<00:03:42.349> to<00:03:42.410> die<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.829> lot<00:03:43.160> climbing<00:03:43.669> in<00:03:43.790> different

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
tend to die a lot climbing in different

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.900 
tend to die a lot climbing in different
objects<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.470> mean<00:03:45.919> I<00:03:46.129> have<00:03:46.669> to<00:03:46.699> have

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
objects and I mean I have to have

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.520 
objects and I mean I have to have
dexterity<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.480> every<00:03:47.660> one<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.870> my<00:03:47.930> classes<00:03:48.349> I

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
dexterity on every one of my classes I

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.349 
dexterity on every one of my classes I
don't<00:03:48.949> know<00:03:49.010> about<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.280> guys<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:49.489> dexterity

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
don't know about you guys but dexterity

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.530 
don't know about you guys but dexterity
is<00:03:50.620> probably<00:03:51.620> my<00:03:51.859> favorite<00:03:51.889> perk<00:03:52.699> right<00:03:53.299> next

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
is probably my favorite perk right next

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.150 
is probably my favorite perk right next
to<00:03:53.629> ghosts<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.139> have<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.349> use<00:03:54.470> ghost<00:03:54.709> on<00:03:54.919> all<00:03:55.040> my

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
to ghosts I have to use ghost on all my

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.270 
to ghosts I have to use ghost on all my
classes<00:03:55.400> also<00:03:55.699> and<00:03:56.090> I'm<00:03:56.799> one<00:03:57.799> really<00:03:58.129> nice

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
classes also and I'm one really nice

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.920 
classes also and I'm one really nice
perk<00:03:58.579> setup<00:03:58.879> i<00:03:59.030> have<00:03:59.150> recently<00:03:59.540> started<00:03:59.660> using

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
perk setup i have recently started using

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.000 
perk setup i have recently started using
is<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.849> ghost<00:04:01.849> hardline<00:04:03.970> scavenger<00:04:04.970> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
is a ghost hardline scavenger and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.619 
is a ghost hardline scavenger and
engineer<00:04:07.010> now<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.430> reason<00:04:07.669> I<00:04:07.910> use<00:04:07.940> engineers

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
engineer now the reason I use engineers

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.259 
engineer now the reason I use engineers
because<00:04:08.870> without<00:04:09.139> flak<00:04:09.709> jacket<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.730> can<00:04:10.760> see

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
because without flak jacket you can see

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.080 
because without flak jacket you can see
shock<00:04:11.629> charges<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.370> don't<00:04:13.519> you<00:04:13.669> can

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
shock charges and so you don't you can

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.729 
shock charges and so you don't you can
see<00:04:14.269> shock<00:04:14.540> charges<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.079> you<00:04:15.139> don't<00:04:15.379> need<00:04:15.500> tack

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
see shock charges so you don't need tack

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.409 
see shock charges so you don't need tack
mask<00:04:16.010> because<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.729> can<00:04:16.849> always<00:04:16.970> see<00:04:17.180> them<00:04:17.239> and

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
mask because you can always see them and

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.479 
mask because you can always see them and
shoot<00:04:17.539> them<00:04:17.599> and<00:04:17.900> then<00:04:18.349> you<00:04:18.560> don't<00:04:19.039> need<00:04:19.190> flak

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
shoot them and then you don't need flak

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.860 
shoot them and then you don't need flak
jacket<00:04:19.940> because<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.329> can<00:04:20.510> see<00:04:20.720> all<00:04:20.750> the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
jacket because you can see all the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.020 
jacket because you can see all the
bouncing<00:04:21.229> buddies<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.560> claymores<00:04:21.890> so<00:04:22.640> it

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
bouncing buddies and claymores so it

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.170 
bouncing buddies and claymores so it
almost<00:04:23.240> acts<00:04:23.599> as<00:04:23.870> two<00:04:24.169> perks<00:04:25.030> engineer<00:04:26.030> does

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
almost acts as two perks engineer does

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.020 
almost acts as two perks engineer does
because<00:04:26.719> you<00:04:26.780> don't

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
because you don't

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.200 
because you don't
new<00:04:27.150> tag<00:04:27.450> mask<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.680> don't<00:04:29.040> need<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.580> flak

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
new tag mask and you don't need a flak

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.180 
new tag mask and you don't need a flak
jacket<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.050> really<00:04:31.260> nice<00:04:31.500> perk<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.950> use

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
jacket so it's a really nice perk to use

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.170 
jacket so it's a really nice perk to use
that's<00:04:32.430> definitely<00:04:32.760> another<00:04:32.970> really

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
that's definitely another really

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.540 
that's definitely another really
underrated<00:04:33.630> perk<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.620> I've<00:04:34.710> been<00:04:34.860> using<00:04:35.070> that

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
underrated perk so I've been using that

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.629 
underrated perk so I've been using that
scavenger<00:04:36.120> hard<00:04:37.020> hard<00:04:37.590> line<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.100> ghost

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
scavenger hard hard line and ghost

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.270 
scavenger hard hard line and ghost
because<00:04:38.940> ghosts<00:04:39.690> obviously<00:04:40.440> keeps<00:04:40.889> away<00:04:41.040> from

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
because ghosts obviously keeps away from

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.640 
because ghosts obviously keeps away from
the<00:04:41.370> UAV<00:04:41.730> spam<00:04:42.030> which<00:04:42.660> actually<00:04:42.930> isn't<00:04:43.320> too

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
the UAV spam which actually isn't too

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.129 
the UAV spam which actually isn't too
bad<00:04:44.040> anymore<00:04:44.430> but<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.150> still<00:04:45.480> do<00:04:45.780> get<00:04:45.960> those

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
bad anymore but you still do get those

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.110 
bad anymore but you still do get those
UAB<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.160> called<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.820> don't<00:04:47.970> want<00:04:48.090> to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
UAB is called in and you don't want to

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.820 
UAB is called in and you don't want to
die<00:04:48.270> in<00:04:48.330> your<00:04:48.389> killstreaks<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.800> a

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
die in your killstreaks to a you to a

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.230 
die in your killstreaks to a you to a
guy<00:04:49.980> that's<00:04:50.220> just<00:04:50.310> camping<00:04:50.820> around<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:51.060> corner

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
guy that's just camping around a corner

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.700 
guy that's just camping around a corner
because<00:04:51.419> he<00:04:51.570> knows<00:04:51.720> you're<00:04:51.900> coming<00:04:52.020> now<00:04:52.470> which

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
because he knows you're coming now which

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.400 
because he knows you're coming now which
is<00:04:52.860> which<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.250> really<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.630> depressing<00:04:54.630> whenever

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
is which is really a depressing whenever

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.900 
is which is really a depressing whenever
you<00:04:55.530> die<00:04:55.680> like<00:04:55.919> that<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.310> prefer<00:04:56.610> using

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
you die like that so I prefer using

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.879 
you die like that so I prefer using
ghost<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.450> hardline<00:04:57.900> as<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.320> all<00:04:58.500> may<00:04:58.860> know

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
ghost and hardline as you all may know

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.550 
ghost and hardline as you all may know
it's<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.730> twenty<00:05:00.090> percent<00:05:00.390> decrease<00:05:01.020> on<00:05:01.350> how

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
it's a twenty percent decrease on how

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.970 
it's a twenty percent decrease on how
much<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.980> takes<00:05:02.160> to<00:05:02.460> get<00:05:03.120> your<00:05:03.270> kill<00:05:03.480> streaks

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
much it takes to get your kill streaks

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.170 
much it takes to get your kill streaks
so<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.070> can<00:05:05.220> get<00:05:05.310> your<00:05:05.370> killstreaks<00:05:05.910> much

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
so you can get your killstreaks much

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.390 
so you can get your killstreaks much
much<00:05:06.419> quicker<00:05:06.690> with<00:05:07.410> hardline<00:05:07.860> which<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.370> a

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
much quicker with hardline which is a

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.280 
much quicker with hardline which is a
huge<00:05:09.000> deal<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.600> big<00:05:09.780> kill<00:05:09.990> streaks<00:05:10.230> I

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
huge deal with the big kill streaks I

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.080 
huge deal with the big kill streaks I
think<00:05:10.470> it's<00:05:10.560> like<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.710> four<00:05:11.130> kill<00:05:11.400> difference<00:05:11.880> I

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
think it's like a four kill difference I

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.390 
think it's like a four kill difference I
you<00:05:13.050> can<00:05:13.169> get<00:05:13.290> that<00:05:13.320> swarm<00:05:13.860> with<00:05:13.980> for<00:05:14.220> less

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
you can get that swarm with for less

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.220 
you can get that swarm with for less
kills<00:05:14.700> which<00:05:14.910> is<00:05:15.030> really<00:05:15.360> big<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:16.050> game

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
kills which is really big in this game

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.830 
kills which is really big in this game
because<00:05:17.040> you<00:05:17.550> know<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:17.760> can<00:05:18.000> die<00:05:18.150> quickly<00:05:18.450> and

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
because you know you can die quickly and

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.240 
because you know you can die quickly and
there's<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.350> lot<00:05:19.410> of<00:05:19.470> BS<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:19.979> this<00:05:20.070> game

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
there's a lot of BS in this game

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.570 
there's a lot of BS in this game
actually<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.570> less<00:05:21.780> amount<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.340> deaths<00:05:23.340> or

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
actually so the less amount of deaths or

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.550 
actually so the less amount of deaths or
kills<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:24.030> takes<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.840> get<00:05:24.960> your<00:05:25.050> killstreak

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
kills it takes to get your killstreak

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.800 
kills it takes to get your killstreak
the<00:05:25.770> better<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:26.880> see<00:05:27.120> me<00:05:27.360> not<00:05:27.479> shoot

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
the better and so you see me not shoot

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.120 
the better and so you see me not shoot
that<00:05:28.020> guy<00:05:28.139> I<00:05:28.169> made<00:05:28.410> a<00:05:28.440> pretty<00:05:28.650> good<00:05:28.740> decision

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
that guy I made a pretty good decision

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.110 
that guy I made a pretty good decision
there<00:05:29.250> because<00:05:29.400> if<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.520> would<00:05:29.639> have<00:05:29.700> shot<00:05:29.760> him

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
there because if I would have shot him

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.670 
there because if I would have shot him
he<00:05:30.690> probably<00:05:30.810> would<00:05:31.080> have<00:05:31.140> came<00:05:31.320> back<00:05:31.500> for<00:05:31.650> the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
he probably would have came back for the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.290 
he probably would have came back for the
revenge<00:05:32.010> kill<00:05:32.250> while<00:05:32.430> i<00:05:32.460> was<00:05:32.520> in<00:05:32.640> my<00:05:32.790> lodestar

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
revenge kill while i was in my lodestar

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.080 
revenge kill while i was in my lodestar

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
in my VTOL warship and that would have

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.380 
in my VTOL warship and that would have
that<00:05:36.780> epistle<00:05:37.229> i'm<00:05:37.650> already<00:05:37.919> 100<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.760> i<00:05:39.150> think
