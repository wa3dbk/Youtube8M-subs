a guitar center no matter what pretty
much<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.620> I've<00:02:45.620> kind<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.890> done<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.100> math<00:02:46.400> and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
much so I've kind of done the math and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.020 
much so I've kind of done the math and
it's<00:02:48.680> basically<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:51.400> virtual<00:02:52.400> vinyl<00:02:52.550> tirado

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
it's basically the virtual vinyl tirado

have used both and what kind of you know

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.210 
have used both and what kind of you know
things<00:03:17.210> that<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:17.450> come<00:03:17.630> across<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:18.290> lot<00:03:19.190> of

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
things that you come across a lot of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.310 
things that you come across a lot of
people<00:03:19.430> say<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.910> serato<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
people say that serato is like a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.840 
people say that serato is like a
stripped<00:03:21.650> down<00:03:21.680> version<00:03:21.800> it<00:03:22.460> works<00:03:22.610> better

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
stripped down version it works better

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.960 
stripped down version it works better
but<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:23.240> other<00:03:23.360> people<00:03:23.570> tell<00:03:23.990> me<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.380> um

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
but then other people tell me that um

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.790 
but then other people tell me that um
the<00:03:25.970> serato<00:03:26.240> actually<00:03:26.540> crashes<00:03:26.990> more<00:03:27.200> one

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
the serato actually crashes more one

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.790 
the serato actually crashes more one
running<00:03:28.130> videos<00:03:28.460> so<00:03:29.110> maybe<00:03:30.110> because<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:30.710> a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
running videos so maybe because it's a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.530 
running videos so maybe because it's a
plug-in<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.460> that<00:03:31.610> like<00:03:31.850> built<00:03:32.120> right<00:03:32.330> into

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
plug-in and that like built right into

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.010 
plug-in and that like built right into
it<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.960> don't<00:03:33.320> know<00:03:33.970> also<00:03:34.970> virtual<00:03:35.450> vinyl<00:03:35.600> seems

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
it I don't know also virtual vinyl seems

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.000 
it I don't know also virtual vinyl seems
to<00:03:36.320> run<00:03:36.620> more<00:03:37.930> different<00:03:38.930> types<00:03:39.110> of<00:03:39.320> video

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
to run more different types of video

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.890 
to run more different types of video
files<00:03:41.110> MPEG<00:03:42.110> divx<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.390> all<00:03:44.390> kinds<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:45.670> things

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
files MPEG divx and all kinds of things

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.200 
files MPEG divx and all kinds of things
