00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 and that's where all these axioms inscribed 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.099
 video a bit special then because we are 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.150
 on assassin's creed revelations is in 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.990
 done i'm going to show you a solution 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.100
 is easy on the ground because I have 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.830
 noticed that a lot of people 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.619
 could not do 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 to do this look I'm not good at 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:34.480
 to talk about it is here it's the show of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 two emissions perish hayes so I 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.080
 noticed that actually a lot of people 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.290
 could not do these 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.340
 happened 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.340
 in this I will not 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.799
 that's the bomb then embodies 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.790
 I would like a lot of people 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.799
 could not do it in turn his 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.659
 could not create conflict between 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.140
 factions with different guards to 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.760
 every time 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.720
 so I'm actually it's very very 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.720
 simple so I'm going to show you how 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:17.200
 must be exactly I will 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:18.640
 show how to do it will fall because 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 I noticed that a lot of people 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.100
 who would ask me how to do it 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.650
 while it is a fact is very simple 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.080
 very very healthy we will go to drink on 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.710
 return home piri reis piri reis 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:40.630
 we'll go see him here it's this one 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.410
 will be good we will spend the streun I 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:49.450
 you save past the cutscene 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:53.740
 that's a concept so it's actually 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.460
 very very very very very simple so 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.540
 here 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.729
 so we will go best where we 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.409
 say to go to our destination in 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:12.100
 the season destination hop there we go 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:16.700
 throw a bomb where we are now saying 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.150
 this balzac will alert them and the assassin 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.150
 to iron 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 then you have to go to the other 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.910
 destination so here so the device 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.320
 it will launch the bank here and you 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.140
 noticed that right here here here there is 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120
 go aimin rage here not too much these 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.620
 byzantines where the Ottomans and the Bahia 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.750
 the others on the left there are the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.450
 so byzantine and ottoman I am more 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.820
 grave threw a bomb there and so this 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.269
 that will make both the two 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.420
 factions 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.640
 finally the Ottomans and Byzantines they 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 will meet iran is bankrupt 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.190
 is alive goes bankrupt and so that's it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.660
 this is the first first entrusted after 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.790
 then they tell us to leave the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.860
 zone but in fact one must not leave 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.060
 The area 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.730
 it's very simple, you must not 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.440
 leave the area you have to come here and we 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.440
 notice that here there are Byzantines 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.519
 we go up a little here and we notice that 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.959
 here here there are Ottomans so in 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.420
 done it's very very simple it takes 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.440
 take a bomb and launched it if it has 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.170
 pretty much here here that's it 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.549
 and so it is obvious and the Ottomans 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.579
 who went back contingency and that's it 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.560
 optional goals accomplished the asti 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.880
 video to show you that 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.680
 what I noticed that nobody 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.750
 did not arrive then it's very very 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.180
 very simple just do not leave 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.120
 not leave the area 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.370
 and she started here pretty much for 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.300
 So here it goes good after one 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.120
 can leave reasoned and here we have 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.330
 finished so I tell you bye bye and at the 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.330
 next
