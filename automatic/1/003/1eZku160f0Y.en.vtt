thing<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.930> just<00:02:45.140> google<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.160> you

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
thing is to just google it so you you

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.190 
thing is to just google it so you you
know<00:02:47.239> where<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> find<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.750> because<00:02:47.840> otherwise
