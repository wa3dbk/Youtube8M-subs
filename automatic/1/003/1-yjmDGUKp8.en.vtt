about your sugar push that's the other
one<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.149> already<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.409> danced<00:01:49.649> one

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
one you already know so we danced one

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.969 
one you already know so we danced one
and<00:01:50.340> two<00:01:50.820> three<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.750> four<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and two three and four and back up in a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.240 
and two three and four and back up in a
straight<00:01:53.250> line<00:01:53.280> two<00:01:53.970> three<00:01:54.689> let<00:01:55.110> her<00:01:55.229> go<00:01:55.500> five

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
straight line two three let her go five

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
straight line two three let her go five
and<00:01:56.579> six<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.450> once<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> start<00:01:58.110> a

and six so once you know to start a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
and six so once you know to start a
basic<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.829> use<00:01:58.950> any<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.520> three

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
basic you can use any of your three
