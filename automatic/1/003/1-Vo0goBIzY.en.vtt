00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.179
 people with a comment from the channel 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.679
 back and today on the black ops gameplay 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.450
 on the mettnau with the eye and the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.580
 extended magazine and that was probably the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.740
 fastest intro I ever brought 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 So I do not have anything left now 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.410
 to the web and my weapon say that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.850
 I have just done it even if it 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 nobody understood that is me now 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.430
 no matter who has understood that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 can feel free to comment 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.740
 write 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.820
 but that it should also not 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.960
 go to I have long been 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.610
 Do not show up here now 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 I am already one to be exact 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 been absent, and so to speak 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.680
 I thought I had to do something again 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 upload and I want to above all things 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 Upload again from 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.899
 it just lately has somehow 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.070
 not really fit because yes how 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.690
 you know that maybe that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.309
 Study is going on so slowly maybe 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.570
 it is partly with you then the school 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.670
 which starts slowly there you always have 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.350
 By the way, I'm still on the less time 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.120
 moved on the last weekend I have 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.430
 I already said that is but now 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.770
 rather less moving and the main reason 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.410
 is actually who sadly already 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.930
 almost that warrior paravan semi-final 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.820
 has gone off and I back forever 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 I needed to finish the video 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.979
 put 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.170
 luckily I managed that now 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.400
 renders just now and after 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.750
 That's what I have to do tonight 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.280
 I hope that works now 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.080
 Everything and then I think you will 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.610
 a very good video, so to speak 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 I hope warriors at the lakes anyway 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.540
 I like that very well in any case 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 and I do not know it's already on 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.979
 a little bit longer, if you like that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.380
 last video of me remembered there it went 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.450
 namely yes to Jacques Annaud so to speak 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.820
 as a head again with black ops 2 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.570
 could be introduced and there I was 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.159
 yes strong for and why had to be or 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.950
 how it could not have been better 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 I say is an English or 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 an american youtuber too on like that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.619
 a similar idea had come and had 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.259
 also made a video about it and that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 he then suggested the xda against 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 to exchange a ballistics wester 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.210
 that is not comparable to the one now 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.460
 juggernaut castle but it is at least 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 something like that you know so that is the ball 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.829
 ballistic vest I mean 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.469
 your safety vest 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.600
 he knows from mw 3d is similar to 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.619
 magath but she regenerates herself 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.079
 not if you once yes 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.550
 was shot away with it or if the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.020
 once taken damage then 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580
 does not regenerate itself and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.470
 you 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.230
 he has his normal life, so to speak 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.400
 restore his normal life 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.410
 and this was something like that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.340
 suggested in one of his videos and 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.740
 this video actually has it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.200
 managed to penetrate up to trade so 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.680
 many have now and at david 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.360
 walker tweeted on twitter and that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.800
 was actually quite amazing 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.300
 thinks i'm little jenny i got there 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.370
 no chance that anyone from 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.870
 track looks but he has it 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.760
 managed and he even has an answer 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.780
 david vann nath said 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.210
 that he is the quote of the fiction of black 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.800
 ops 2 it so far myself what the 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.330
 means that belongs in the so to speak 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.980
 Setting that's what the developers want there 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.860
 like to have reasons of satin 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.540
 and he is he sees no chance that 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.770
 somehow ballistics vest by 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.660
 is exchanged 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.959
 and there we have ours 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.510
 little answer that he probably no 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.250
 ballistic vest will give in black ops 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.140
 case a shame and probably then too 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.390
 no juggernaut because that depends so 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 So it's mine 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.860
 but idea for the cat had been but 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.590
 I am glad that this idea is yes 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.530
 so to speak in not about me but 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.940
 on other ways to strake penetrated 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.920
 The idea was a bit 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.720
 different okay that's true but you 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.630
 after all, it has come so far and that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.100
 he was rejected then is ok but 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.300
 it is amazing that the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.890
 Developers a bit here 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.640
 to deal with the community 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.830
 the yes I'll tell the mw3 bmw 3 his 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.480
 modern warfare share rather less 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.800
 the developers do it their thing and so 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.910
 now it looks a bit like that 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.500
 as if they finally listen to the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.530
 community and sometimes even on the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.150
 youtube community what he saw there 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.459
 I mean part of the normal cod 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.050
 communitys i mean all of us here 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.130
 youtube look we are so many 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.050
 You see that in the big German 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.220
 youtube on and especially on the big ones 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.800
 English and come 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.720
 to make comment youtube also 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.460
 we are relatively many but there are 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.140
 many more people simply using cod 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.150
 play by this youtube teeth even 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.590
 do not know that he is from it 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.090
 just because the developers are 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.740
 not necessarily what to hold now 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.720
 We suggest that because there is 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.760
 just a lot more people that way 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.500
 a little bit interested 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.540
 and yes, I can only give you one 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.100
 youtuber so to speak recommend that has 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.480
 now nothing at all 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.370
 to do advertising somehow 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.260
 does not know me either and that is 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.910
 that really this English or 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.630
 America has its English because he has 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.440
 English speaks the American 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.000
 youtuber 402 thunder 4 0 2 he has that 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.800
 Video made about it and he makes real 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.270
 good suggestions and is also available 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.850
 contact me a bit with david warner 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.500
 only half by his size he has and 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.880
 like 400 140,000 subscribers that's it 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.170
 goes commander warrior is for example 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.850
 bigger here in germany for 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.280
 American standards, that's real 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.840
 little but it's enough yes 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.290
 so to speak with the big players too 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.240
 can 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.410
 and I can not impress upon your heart 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 if he even learn something like that 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.040
 want to and mitkriegen wanted something like that 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.500
 maybe a developer penetrates 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.360
 he the gameplay now ends here with 39 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.950
 28 I think that it is very solid for 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.630
 a team of people over half 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.600
 the neighborhood is unfortunately also a 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.710
 scraped off a couple of times but that's just how it is 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.450
 I hope you liked it writes 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.490
 my comments what here from this 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.090
 shit intro keep that was a bit 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.919
 ridiculous 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.460
 yes my name is more quest and I am 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.460
 now out
