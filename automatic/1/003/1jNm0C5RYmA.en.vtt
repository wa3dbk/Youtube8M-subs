okay here's one that I'm gonna call the
flam<00:00:21.449> double<00:00:22.080> stroke<00:00:22.380> four<00:00:28.039> all<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.099> let<00:00:29.310> me

flam double stroke four all right let me

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.939 
flam double stroke four all right let me
break<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.609> down<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.529> it's<00:00:31.529> based<00:00:31.800> off

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
break this down for you it's based off

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.090 
break this down for you it's based off
of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> flam<00:00:32.550> drag<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.680> gonna<00:00:37.829> do

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of the flam drag and what I'm gonna do

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.450 
of the flam drag and what I'm gonna do
instead<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> drag<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.960> gonna<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
instead of the drag I'm gonna take the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
instead of the drag I'm gonna take the
rhythm<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.809> single<00:00:43.290> stroke<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:44.570> or<00:00:45.570> off<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
rhythm of a single stroke for or off the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
rhythm of a single stroke for or off the
left<00:00:48.410> instead<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> single<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.789> I'm

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
left instead of the single of that I'm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.500 
left instead of the single of that I'm
gonna<00:00:51.239> double<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.760> or<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.750> left<00:00:56.510> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
gonna double that or off the left so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.080 
gonna double that or off the left so
just<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.079> an<00:00:58.440> exercise<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.699> I'm<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> do

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
just as an exercise what I'm going to do

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
just as an exercise what I'm going to do
for<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> I'll<00:01:00.629> play<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:01.199> single<00:01:01.680> stroke<00:01:01.859> for

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
for you is I'll play a single stroke for

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
for you is I'll play a single stroke for
four<00:01:03.059> times<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.170> I'll<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> same

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
four times and then I'll do the same

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:19.010 
four times and then I'll do the same
pattern<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.970> double<00:01:06.299> form<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.469 

so<00:01:20.020> you're<00:01:20.170> gonna<00:01:20.290> notice<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
so you're gonna notice with that the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.630 
so you're gonna notice with that the
single<00:01:22.840> stroke<00:01:23.050> four<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.710> basically<00:01:24.190> going<00:01:24.550> to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
single stroke four is basically going to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.969 
single stroke four is basically going to
set<00:01:24.940> up<00:01:25.150> how<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.659> interpret<00:01:26.410> your<00:01:26.440> double

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
set up how you interpret your double

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.650 
set up how you interpret your double
it's<00:01:27.369> actually<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:27.880> open<00:01:28.210> up<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.509> little

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
it's actually going to open up a little

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.540 
it's actually going to open up a little
bit<00:01:28.840> more<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.320> like<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.890> think<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.160> when<00:01:30.430> you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
bit more I like to think that when you

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.570 
bit more I like to think that when you
play<00:01:30.790> double<00:01:31.210> strokes<00:01:31.770> within<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:33.040> triplet

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
play double strokes within a triplet

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.030 
play double strokes within a triplet
pattern<00:01:34.000> they<00:01:34.570> have<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.720> tendency<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.590> get<00:01:36.009> a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
pattern they have a tendency to get a

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.700 
pattern they have a tendency to get a
little<00:01:36.220> bit<00:01:36.430> more<00:01:36.610> wider<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.840> try<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.409> stay

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
little bit more wider just try to stay

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.130 
little bit more wider just try to stay
true<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.340> rhythmic<00:01:39.759> figure<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:40.869> I'll<00:01:40.990> play

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
true to the rhythmic figure so I'll play

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.719 
true to the rhythmic figure so I'll play
those<00:01:41.320> again<00:01:41.590> one<00:01:41.830> more<00:01:41.979> time<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.399> can<00:01:42.490> kind

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
those again one more time you can kind

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.130 
those again one more time you can kind
of<00:01:42.789> hear<00:01:43.030> what's<00:01:43.330> going<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.750> with<00:01:43.930> that<00:01:44.080> but

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
of hear what's going on with that but

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.480 
of hear what's going on with that but
you're<00:01:44.380> going<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.590> see<00:01:44.740> something<00:01:45.009> different

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
you're going to see something different

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
you're going to see something different
with<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.670> double<00:01:45.940> stroke

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.870 

I'll<00:01:52.840> try<00:01:53.020> those<00:01:53.170> off<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.470> left<00:01:59.580> so<00:02:00.580> now<00:02:00.700> what

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
I'll try those off the left so now what

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.160 
I'll try those off the left so now what
I'm<00:02:00.940> going<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.390> going<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.690> put<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.899> flam

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
I'm going to do is going to put the flam

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.190 
I'm going to do is going to put the flam
in<00:02:02.380> front<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.190> play<00:02:04.149> that<00:02:04.390> as<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.899> flam

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
in front of it and play that as the flam

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.190 
in front of it and play that as the flam
double<00:02:05.649> stroke<00:02:05.860> four<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.690> reason<00:02:10.959> why<00:02:11.050> I'm

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
double stroke four so the reason why I'm

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.630 
double stroke four so the reason why I'm
playing<00:02:11.410> both<00:02:11.709> off<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.370> left<00:02:12.550> so

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
playing both off the right and left so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.280 
playing both off the right and left so
you<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:12.910> kind<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.180> get<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.390> alternated

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you can kind of get that alternated

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:25.670 
you can kind of get that alternated
pattern<00:02:14.739> down<00:02:16.049> off<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.470> right<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.010> then

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.990 

here's<00:02:26.680> an<00:02:26.829> exercise<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.549> like<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.880> play

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
here's an exercise that I like to play

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500 
here's an exercise that I like to play
that<00:02:28.329> uses<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.230> flam<00:02:29.500> accent<00:02:30.040> flam<00:02:30.850> drag<00:02:31.180> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
that uses the flam accent flam drag and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.430 
that uses the flam accent flam drag and
the<00:02:31.840> flam<00:02:32.140> double<00:02:32.890> stroke<00:02:33.130> for<00:02:33.430> hopefully

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the flam double stroke for hopefully

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.870 
the flam double stroke for hopefully
one's<00:02:35.440> gonna<00:02:35.680> help<00:02:36.010> set<00:02:36.340> up<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.670> other

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
one's gonna help set up the other

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:47.680 
one's gonna help set up the other
pattern<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:38.350> goes<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:38.739> this

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:59.360 

I'll<00:02:48.690> try<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.840> again<00:02:57.860> now<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.190> open

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
I'll try that again now you can open

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.610 
I'll try that again now you can open
those<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.630> want<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:01.290> talking

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
those up if you want and I'm talking

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.309 
those up if you want and I'm talking
about<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.010> diddle<00:03:02.480> interpretation<00:03:09.200> or<00:03:10.200> you

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
about the diddle interpretation or you

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.540 
about the diddle interpretation or you
can<00:03:10.440> play<00:03:10.620> em<00:03:10.739> tighter<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:16.380> cool<00:03:16.590> thing<00:03:16.980> again

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
can play em tighter the cool thing again

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.699 
can play em tighter the cool thing again
talking<00:03:18.060> about<00:03:18.239> diddle<00:03:18.750> interpretation<00:03:19.530> is

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
talking about diddle interpretation is

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.039 
talking about diddle interpretation is
that<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.519> could<00:03:20.700> take<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> same<00:03:21.330> pattern<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
that you could take the same pattern and

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.500 
that you could take the same pattern and
make<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.620> sound<00:03:22.769> different<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
make it sound different if you see the
