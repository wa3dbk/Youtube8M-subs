smells<00:01:51.930> exactly<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.680> wasabi<00:01:53.009> apple<00:01:53.490> but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
smells exactly like the wasabi apple but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
smells exactly like the wasabi apple but
I<00:01:54.060> didn't<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.750> possible<00:01:55.079> for

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
I didn't think it would be possible for

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.440 
I didn't think it would be possible for
them<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.369> repackage<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.009> mean

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
them to be a repackage because I mean

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.870 
them to be a repackage because I mean
how<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.170> put<00:02:01.380> wasabi<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> candle<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
how do you put wasabi in a candle and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.060 
how do you put wasabi in a candle and
then<00:02:03.030> market<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.659> anything<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.530> than

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
then market it as anything other than

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.479 
then market it as anything other than
wasabi<00:02:05.969> um<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:07.380> earring<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.829> fell<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.069> oh

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
wasabi um my earring just fell out oh

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.559 
wasabi um my earring just fell out oh
wow

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
wow

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.339 
wow
um<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.849> then<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.879> said<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.359> my<00:02:12.390> last<00:02:12.659> video<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
um and then I said in my last video that

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.050 
um and then I said in my last video that
I<00:02:13.499> thought<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.950> wasabi<00:02:14.280> apple<00:02:14.639> candle<00:02:14.939> as

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I thought the wasabi apple candle as

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.580 
I thought the wasabi apple candle as
gross<00:02:15.269> as<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:15.870> actually<00:02:16.200> better<00:02:16.439> than

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
gross as it is is actually better than

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
gross as it is is actually better than
green<00:02:16.980> apple<00:02:17.310> orchard<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.939> I<00:02:18.030> said<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.510> would

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
green apple orchard and I said I would

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.839 
green apple orchard and I said I would
burn<00:02:19.139> 10<00:02:19.499> wasabi<00:02:19.859> apples<00:02:20.249> before<00:02:20.400> I'd<00:02:20.639> burn

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
burn 10 wasabi apples before I'd burn

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.250 
burn 10 wasabi apples before I'd burn
one<00:02:21.090> green<00:02:21.329> apple<00:02:21.599> orchard<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.109> just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
one green apple orchard because it just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.489 
one green apple orchard because it just
smells<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.920> nasty<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.849> then<00:02:24.659> someone<00:02:24.870> said<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:25.499 
smells so nasty and then someone said I

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.459 
smells so nasty and then someone said I
think<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.189> was<00:02:26.280> Jeremy<00:02:26.639> hi<00:02:26.819> Jeremy<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.989> is

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
think it was Jeremy hi Jeremy that it is

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.080 
think it was Jeremy hi Jeremy that it is
a<00:02:28.500> repackage<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.519> more<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> thought<00:02:30.030> about

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
a repackage and the more I thought about

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.520 
a repackage and the more I thought about
it<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.480> more<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.689> thought<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.139> know<00:02:31.260> maybe

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it the more I thought you know maybe

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.559 
it the more I thought you know maybe
that's<00:02:31.829> why<00:02:32.069> green<00:02:32.430> apple<00:02:32.700> orchard<00:02:33.000> seems<00:02:33.329> so

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
that's why green apple orchard seems so

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.899 
that's why green apple orchard seems so
gross<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.889> wasabi<00:02:35.310> apple<00:02:35.790> i

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
gross because in the wasabi apple i

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.339 
gross because in the wasabi apple i
expect<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.840> wasabi<00:02:38.090> by<00:02:39.090> teenis<00:02:39.480> flavor<00:02:39.930> to

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
expect that wasabi by teenis flavor to

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.959 
expect that wasabi by teenis flavor to
come<00:02:40.560> through<00:02:40.859> but<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.489> smell<00:02:41.700> green

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
come through but when you smell green

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.520 
come through but when you smell green
apple<00:02:42.269> orchard<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.689> don't<00:02:42.840> think<00:02:43.139> it's<00:02:43.290> going

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
apple orchard you don't think it's going

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.550 
apple orchard you don't think it's going
to<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:44.389> wasabi<00:02:45.389> so<00:02:45.840> you're<00:02:46.019> smelling<00:02:46.439> it<00:02:46.530> and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
to be wasabi so you're smelling it and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.470 
to be wasabi so you're smelling it and
you<00:02:46.680> don't<00:02:46.829> know<00:02:46.919> what<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.909> so<00:02:48.359> it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you don't know what it is and so it

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.649 
you don't know what it is and so it
really<00:02:48.870> seems<00:02:49.379> gross<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:50.209> don't<00:02:51.209> know<00:02:51.299> why<00:02:51.480> they

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
really seems gross I don't know why they

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.179 
really seems gross I don't know why they
would<00:02:51.810> put<00:02:51.989> these<00:02:52.109> two<00:02:52.290> things<00:02:52.469> together<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
would put these two things together I

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.649 
would put these two things together I
don't<00:02:53.639> know<00:02:53.730> why<00:02:53.849> they<00:02:54.030> would<00:02:54.180> put<00:02:54.389> it<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.569> in

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
don't know why they would put it out in

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.869 
don't know why they would put it out in
two<00:02:54.810> different<00:02:54.959> types<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.349> packaging<00:02:56.069> maybe

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
two different types of packaging maybe

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.099 
two different types of packaging maybe
they're<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.120> same<00:02:57.269> maybe<00:02:57.480> they're<00:02:57.689> not<00:02:57.719> I

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
they're the same maybe they're not I

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.830 
they're the same maybe they're not I
kind<00:02:58.439> of<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.889> they<00:02:59.040> are<00:02:59.310> now<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.629> same

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
kind of think that they are now the same

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.319 
kind of think that they are now the same
candle<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:02.370> only<00:03:02.579> thing<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.849> wasabi<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
candle the only thing that wasabi and

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.000 
candle the only thing that wasabi and
apple<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.109> common<00:03:04.469> would<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.919> they

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
apple have in common would be that they

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.729 
apple have in common would be that they
both<00:03:05.219> can<00:03:05.519> smell<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:06.090> chemically<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.260> like

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
both can smell really chemically I like

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.259 
both can smell really chemically I like
the<00:03:07.919> sweet<00:03:08.219> apple<00:03:08.579> sounds<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:08.939> pumpkin

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
the sweet apple sounds like pumpkin

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.740 
the sweet apple sounds like pumpkin
apple<00:03:09.569> cider<00:03:09.959> candles<00:03:10.439> they're<00:03:10.739> amazing<00:03:11.750> but

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
apple cider candles they're amazing but

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.509 
apple cider candles they're amazing but
like<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> green<00:03:13.349> apple<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.919> me<00:03:14.040> always<00:03:14.220> smelled

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
like a green apple to me always smelled

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.580 
like a green apple to me always smelled
like<00:03:14.549> hairspray<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.900> when<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.139> put<00:03:16.349> that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
like hairspray and so when you put that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.199 
like hairspray and so when you put that
with<00:03:16.799> wasabi<00:03:17.189> I<00:03:17.400> mean<00:03:17.639> it's<00:03:17.759> like<00:03:17.849> sticking

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
with wasabi I mean it's like sticking

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.210 
with wasabi I mean it's like sticking
your<00:03:18.239> head<00:03:18.479> in<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.750> bucket<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.199> pesticide<00:03:19.889> it's

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
your head in a bucket of pesticide it's

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.699 
your head in a bucket of pesticide it's
really<00:03:20.609> really<00:03:20.909> nasty<00:03:21.169> so<00:03:22.169> then<00:03:22.319> before<00:03:22.500> I

was thinking you know I bet the wasabi
apple<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.579> bet<00:03:41.729> it's<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:41.970> same<00:03:42.209> situation<00:03:42.810> I

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
apple I bet it's the same situation I

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.599 
apple I bet it's the same situation I
bet<00:03:43.139> you<00:03:43.259> smell<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.680> wasabi<00:03:44.009> on<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.400> cold

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.219 
bet you smell that wasabi on the cold
throat<00:03:44.909> but<00:03:45.150> then<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.569> don't<00:03:45.810> smell<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.079> when

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229

throat but then you don't smell it when
it's<00:03:46.379> burning<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.009> then<00:03:47.159> that's<00:03:47.459> why<00:03:47.759> they

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
it's burning and then that's why they

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.119 
it's burning and then that's why they
can<00:03:48.659> repackage<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.199> as<00:03:49.349> just<00:03:49.530> green<00:03:49.829> apple

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
can repackage it as just green apple

can repackage it as just green apple
orchard<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.609> guess<00:03:50.989> still<00:03:51.989> think<00:03:52.139> bad<00:03:52.379> idea

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
would be hard to evaluate throw from a

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.380 
would be hard to evaluate throw from a
mini<00:04:32.770> candle<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.520> predict<00:04:33.970> what<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.210> three

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
mini candle and predict what the three

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.990 
mini candle and predict what the three
wychwood<00:04:34.720> throw<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.230> but<00:04:35.680> strength<00:04:36.250> wise<00:04:36.610> I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
wychwood throw like but strength wise I

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
over this candle and I get that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.390 
over this candle and I get that
sensation<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.430> smelling<00:04:42.850> um<00:04:44.160> it's<00:04:45.160> like<00:04:45.310> I

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
sensation of smelling um it's like I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.670 
sensation of smelling um it's like I
smell<00:04:45.730> wax<00:04:46.180> burning<00:04:46.870> or<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.140> a<00:04:47.170> general

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
smell wax burning or like a general

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.310 
smell wax burning or like a general
burning<00:04:48.220> smell<00:04:48.580> more<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.420> I<00:04:49.450> actually<00:04:49.720> get

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
burning smell more that I actually get

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.320 
burning smell more that I actually get
the<00:04:50.620> scent<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.370> what<00:04:51.520> it's<00:04:51.640> supposed<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.090> be

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
the scent of what it's supposed to be

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.590 
the scent of what it's supposed to be
like<00:04:52.540> you<00:04:52.870> know<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:54.070> it's<00:04:54.250> not<00:04:54.520> very<00:04:54.790> strong<00:04:55.210> at

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
like you know so it's not very strong at

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.080 
like you know so it's not very strong at
all<00:04:55.690> based<00:04:56.650> on<00:04:56.920> how<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.250> mini<00:04:57.580> candle<00:04:57.970> is

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
all based on how the mini candle is

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.000 
all based on how the mini candle is
throwing<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:59.050> would<00:04:59.230> predict<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.830> three

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
throwing I would predict that the three

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.710 
throwing I would predict that the three
week<00:05:00.160> might<00:05:00.430> actually<00:05:00.670> throw<00:05:01.210> pretty<00:05:01.480> well

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
week might actually throw pretty well

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.570 
week might actually throw pretty well
because<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.140> could<00:05:02.380> stand<00:05:02.620> another<00:05:02.890> side<00:05:03.550> of

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
because I could stand another side of

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.890 
because I could stand another side of
the<00:05:03.700> room<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:03.910> kind<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.270> catch<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.540> whiff<00:05:04.720> of

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
the room and kind of catch a whiff of

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.970 
the room and kind of catch a whiff of
this<00:05:05.080> unfortunately<00:05:05.860> um<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:07.450> maybe<00:05:07.950> what<00:05:08.950> I

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
this unfortunately um so maybe what I

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.740 
this unfortunately um so maybe what I
can<00:05:09.220> say<00:05:09.430> about<00:05:09.460> performance<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.450> all<00:05:10.570> the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
can say about performance of all the

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.020 
can say about performance of all the
many<00:05:10.930> candles<00:05:11.290> as<00:05:11.440> they're<00:05:11.620> doing<00:05:11.950> well<00:05:12.190> I'm

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
many candles as they're doing well I'm

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.330 
many candles as they're doing well I'm
not<00:05:13.300> overly<00:05:13.960> impressed<00:05:14.410> with<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.710> sense<00:05:15.040> in

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
they're all burning really well this one

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.670 
they're all burning really well this one
here<00:05:46.330> it's<00:05:47.170> a<00:05:47.500> almost<00:05:47.950> done<00:05:48.130> thankfully<00:05:48.520> and

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
here it's a almost done thankfully and

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.870 
here it's a almost done thankfully and
you<00:05:50.680> know<00:05:50.800> I<00:05:50.830> haven't<00:05:51.220> had<00:05:51.280> any<00:05:51.490> problems<00:05:51.850> with

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
you know I haven't had any problems with

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.310 
you know I haven't had any problems with
the<00:05:52.030> pooling<00:05:52.240> out<00:05:52.480> or<00:05:52.630> anything<00:05:52.750> like<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:52.990> so

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
the pooling out or anything like that so

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.970 
the pooling out or anything like that so
I<00:05:53.350> think<00:05:53.470> that<00:05:53.680> these<00:05:53.950> do<00:05:54.690> burn<00:05:55.710> better<00:05:56.710> than

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
I think that these do burn better than

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.590 
I think that these do burn better than
the<00:05:57.160> standard<00:05:57.640> bath<00:05:57.970> body<00:05:58.210> works<00:05:58.300> many

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
the standard bath body works many

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.200 
the standard bath body works many
candles<00:05:59.080> so<00:05:59.670> maybe<00:06:00.670> if<00:06:00.850> that's<00:06:01.030> any

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
candles so maybe if that's any

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.720 
candles so maybe if that's any
consolation<00:06:01.270> I<00:06:02.050> hope<00:06:02.770> that<00:06:02.980> they<00:06:03.160> come<00:06:03.580> out

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
consolation I hope that they come out

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.550 
consolation I hope that they come out
