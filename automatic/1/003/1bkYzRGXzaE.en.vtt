00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello people and has a little 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.080
 explanatory video to that has been 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 side is running this page is straight 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.450
 just arrived fresh is just fresh 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 known 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 and yes, here you can see how high 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.800
 the chances of a victory are yes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 now this page before the nose of the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.710
 crew have taken this 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 feature he comes back in front of it or 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.439
 I'm always singing and singing 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 still as ill as before 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.460
 I won this one and I can do it 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 you can even instantly 57.4 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 percent we gain and 42 6 percent 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.250
 win the or respectively 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.860
 we lose here you have to be more specific 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.660
 Look that he is this purple 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 our countries are beautiful too 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.399
 purple and yes the other way would be better 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.699
 had written 57 and here 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.320
 the 42 but well you can see one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.670
 what kind of skills chorus has here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 Can you recognize yourself with nose system 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 By far the largest cisco I have on 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 give it all 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.760
 with 3200 the only thing that comes to mind is the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.259
 name its 2800 and I'm going to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.570
 Come on July and you can already see 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.930
 I'm twice as risky as that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.299
 us so I just say I was in 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.780
 the 25 minute I had scarcely more 1 506 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.549
 600 and the eleven it just to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.439
 like 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.790
 as all assumptions are then 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 of course, a very small advantage 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.220
 if you press on each of them 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.180
 name then died exactly that happens then 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 the image this is my silver page 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.730
 1 , by the way, uses as well as many 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.240
 Dots is just like mine 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.650
 idea is similar to dai qing once 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.070
 the advantage is really here camera too 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.890
 see 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.810
 Bring the gameplay so much today 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.180
 view on top is in google 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.340
 chrome finished so here 5 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.060
 shortened and so what everything can stop there 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 you see now that my top five 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.450
 Do not fight that for us 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.250
 played the most like today 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.710
 really the top five camps with the am 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.270
 best is yes with someone's most spams 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.120
 In short, it was also a relaxed here 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.520
 the producer is now my best 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.920
 player was yes I want asus asus is yes 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.420
 logically there you can now see the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.959
 whole camps I already played 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.260
 yes that's the whole 74 79 cent 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.320
 monika the whole with the scope of 2111 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.570
 have a better score than ingenious 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.530
 although I was in the game it was a game 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.230
 model geiser and I'm thinking with that 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.489
 sketch of 0.21 risen I've got 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.709
 better skills choir than lily it 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:08.120
 Something is not right here for me 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:10.420
 Held this 3290 1 3321 you can there 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:17.160
 You can enter at the top 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:21.780
 he is not my buddy henry 1345 so 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.780
 so bronze 1 again germain 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.330
 mold background and jaja his 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.130
 doors 69 already played 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.810
 come on me but not from 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.720
 The idea is that I have 400 more 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.700
 So the whole league so still over him 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.640
 Six points perfect a league 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.720
 over each other and yes that was it for this 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.720
 short explanation
