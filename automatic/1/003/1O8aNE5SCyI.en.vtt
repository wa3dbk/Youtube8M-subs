considering that every place is
different<00:00:26.010> especially<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.699> you're<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> mall

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
different especially if you're in a mall

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.029 
different especially if you're in a mall
or<00:00:27.240> an<00:00:27.570> actual<00:00:27.720> store<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:28.859> like

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
or an actual store and what not like

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
or an actual store and what not like
that<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.179> main<00:00:30.359> way<00:00:30.539> I'm<00:00:30.660> gonna<00:00:30.779> actually<00:00:30.929> be

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that the main way I'm gonna actually be

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.540 
that the main way I'm gonna actually be
rating<00:00:31.500> these<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.830> pretty<00:00:32.070> much<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> one

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
rating these is pretty much a one

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
rating these is pretty much a one
through<00:00:32.759> five<00:00:32.940> scale<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:34.410> being<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
through five scale of one being that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.170 
through five scale of one being that
they<00:00:35.250> kind<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.579> missed<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> mark<00:00:35.969> completely

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
they kind of missed the mark completely

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240 
they kind of missed the mark completely
it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> horrible<00:00:37.200> conception<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> flavor

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
it's a horrible conception of a flavor

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
it's a horrible conception of a flavor
and<00:00:38.579> didn't<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.570> work<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.899> too<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and didn't really work out too well and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.830 
and didn't really work out too well and
then<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> 5<00:00:41.370> being<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> flavors<00:00:42.420> came<00:00:42.660> together

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
then a 5 being the flavors came together

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
then a 5 being the flavors came together
really<00:00:43.050> nicely<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.370> what

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

and then bits of graham cracker kind of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.600 
and then bits of graham cracker kind of
spec

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
spec

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.820 
spec
about<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.240> then<00:02:08.690> by<00:02:08.810> taking<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.259> bite<00:02:09.410> with<00:02:09.770> a

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
about and then by taking a bite with a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.410 
about and then by taking a bite with a
piece<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.130> chocolate<00:02:10.460> in<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.850> which<00:02:11.060> there<00:02:11.270> is

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
piece of chocolate in it which there is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420 
piece of chocolate in it which there is
obviously<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.840> fair<00:02:12.140> amount<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.100> works

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
obviously a fair amount in here it works

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.590 
obviously a fair amount in here it works
out<00:02:13.610> surprisingly<00:02:14.570> like<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.260> s'mores<00:02:15.770> as<00:02:16.600> for

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
out surprisingly like a s'mores as for

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.540 
out surprisingly like a s'mores as for
each<00:02:17.660> individual<00:02:18.140> element<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:19.100> marshmallow

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
each individual element the marshmallow

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.580 
each individual element the marshmallow
flavor<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.360> not<00:02:20.600> too<00:02:20.960> strong<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.440> mean

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
flavor is not too strong I mean

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.140 
flavor is not too strong I mean
obviously<00:02:21.740> depends<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.400> how<00:02:22.520> much<00:02:22.670> they<00:02:22.910> put

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
obviously depends on how much they put

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.000 
obviously depends on how much they put
in<00:02:23.300> there<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:24.140> works<00:02:24.380> enough<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.860> get

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
in there it works enough that you get

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.260 
in there it works enough that you get
the<00:02:25.100> nice<00:02:25.220> subtle<00:02:25.490> fact<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:26.000> there<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.150> a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
the nice subtle fact that there is a

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.180 
the nice subtle fact that there is a
hint<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.630> marshmallow<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.320> there<00:02:27.530> after<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
hint of marshmallow in there after the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.220 
hint of marshmallow in there after the
graham<00:02:28.400> cracker<00:02:28.670> pieces<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> said<00:02:29.750> being

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
graham cracker pieces like I said being

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.510 
graham cracker pieces like I said being
that<00:02:30.290> they<00:02:30.500> originally<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.040> little<00:02:31.310> chunks

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
that they originally in little chunks

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.010 
that they originally in little chunks
and<00:02:31.820> then<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.060> kind<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.300> get<00:02:32.420> ground<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.840> all

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
and then they kind of get ground up all

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.990 
and then they kind of get ground up all
in<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.920> also<00:02:34.100> works<00:02:34.250> out<00:02:34.580> nice<00:02:34.790> because

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
in it that also works out nice because

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.460 
in it that also works out nice because
then<00:02:35.120> you're<00:02:35.270> getting<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.630> little<00:02:35.870> bit<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
then you're getting a little bit of the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.100 
then you're getting a little bit of the
element<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.340> every<00:02:37.850> bite<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.360> as<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.020> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
element and every bite and as for the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.480 
element and every bite and as for the
chocolate<00:02:39.380> being<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.860> there<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.160> fair

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
chocolate being that there is a fair

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.710 
chocolate being that there is a fair
amount<00:02:40.580> in<00:02:40.910> there<00:02:41.090> you're<00:02:41.330> getting<00:02:41.450> pretty

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
amount in there you're getting pretty

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.060 
amount in there you're getting pretty
much<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> same<00:02:42.260> thing<00:02:42.320> you're<00:02:42.650> able<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.890> take

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
much the same thing you're able to take

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.800 
much the same thing you're able to take
a<00:02:43.100> bite<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.730> piece<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.030> chocolate<00:02:44.330> along

flavors<00:02:47.900> work<00:02:48.110> out<00:02:48.320> nicely<00:02:48.590> now<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.280> graham

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
flavors work out nicely now the graham

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.130 
flavors work out nicely now the graham
cracker<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> little<00:02:50.660> bit<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.989> sweet

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
cracker is a little bit on the sweet

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.410 
cracker is a little bit on the sweet
side<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.830> as<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.550> chocolate<00:02:52.790> it's<00:02:53.180> not

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
side and as for the chocolate it's not

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.870 
side and as for the chocolate it's not
too<00:02:53.660> sweet<00:02:53.900> it's<00:02:54.890> pretty<00:02:55.100> similar<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.489> what<00:02:55.850> a

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
too sweet it's pretty similar to what a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.340 
too sweet it's pretty similar to what a
Hershey<00:02:56.239> bar<00:02:56.270> would<00:02:56.570> be<00:02:56.630> but<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.050> would

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
Hershey bar would be but I would

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.199 
Hershey bar would be but I would
honestly<00:02:57.500> say<00:02:57.739> maybe<00:02:58.100> not<00:02:58.340> even<00:02:58.520> as<00:02:58.820> sweet<00:02:59.060> as

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
honestly say maybe not even as sweet as

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.900 
honestly say maybe not even as sweet as
that<00:02:59.420> it's<00:03:00.380> got<00:03:00.530> an<00:03:00.620> overall<00:03:01.010> good<00:03:01.220> flavor<00:03:01.520> and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
that it's got an overall good flavor and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.030 
that it's got an overall good flavor and
it<00:03:02.480> worked<00:03:02.750> out<00:03:02.900> pretty<00:03:03.110> well<00:03:03.290> honestly<00:03:03.950> I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
it worked out pretty well honestly I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.350 
it worked out pretty well honestly I
would<00:03:04.220> probably<00:03:04.340> wait<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.760> at<00:03:04.970> four<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.270> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
would probably wait this at four and a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.660 
would probably wait this at four and a
half<00:03:05.390> out<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.840> five<00:03:06.020> as<00:03:06.560> for<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.190> first<00:03:07.459> one
