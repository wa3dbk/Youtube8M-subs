00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.430

and<00:03:57.940> I'm<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.180> an<00:03:58.240> accident<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:59.050> this<00:03:59.230> is

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
and I'm in an accident but it's this is

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.020 
and I'm in an accident but it's this is
way<00:03:59.560> darker<00:03:59.800> than<00:04:00.130> what<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.400> see<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
way darker than what I see on the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.570 
way darker than what I see on the
pictures<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:02.100> that's<00:04:03.100> about<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.550> only

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
pictures so that's about the only

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.040 
pictures so that's about the only
negative<00:04:04.120> thing<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.300> can<00:04:04.480> see<00:04:04.630> about<00:04:04.660> this<00:04:04.930> so

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
negative thing I can see about this so

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.540 
negative thing I can see about this so
far<00:04:05.080> I've<00:04:05.350> not<00:04:05.500> yet<00:04:05.710> styled<00:04:06.160> them<00:04:06.310> or<00:04:06.400> anything

far I've not yet styled them or anything
like<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.600> I'm<00:04:07.720> not<00:04:07.750> really<00:04:07.900> sure<00:04:08.140> if<00:04:08.290> they

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
like that so I'm not really sure if they

straightening<00:05:35.659> two<00:05:35.960> thumbs<00:05:36.169> they<00:05:36.349> look<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.529> lot

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
straightening two thumbs they look a lot

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.909 
straightening two thumbs they look a lot
less<00:05:36.860> frizzy<00:05:37.279> but<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:37.639> they<00:05:38.180> could<00:05:38.360> go<00:05:38.479> a<00:05:38.509> lot

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
less frizzy but I they could go a lot

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.620 
less frizzy but I they could go a lot
straighter<00:05:39.919> it's<00:05:40.580> just<00:05:40.849> that<00:05:40.909> my<00:05:41.150> hair<00:05:41.360> is<00:05:41.389> not

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
straighter it's just that my hair is not

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.709 
straighter it's just that my hair is not
naturally<00:05:42.409> super<00:05:42.740> pin<00:05:42.949> straight<00:05:43.310> so<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.569> makes

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
naturally super pin straight so it makes

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.950 
naturally super pin straight so it makes
it<00:05:44.840> look<00:05:44.990> more<00:05:45.020> natural<00:05:45.199> when<00:05:46.810> they're<00:05:47.810> not
