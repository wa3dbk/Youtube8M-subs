we've<00:01:12.250> got<00:01:12.520> two<00:01:12.760> turbos<00:01:12.970> right

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.560 

it's<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.140> zero<00:01:22.250> 216<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.549> three<00:01:24.000> seconds<00:01:24.509> or

Wi-Fi<00:01:44.000> was<00:01:44.180> first<00:01:46.689> this<00:01:47.689> is<00:01:47.810> feel<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.140> here<00:01:48.320> I

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
Wi-Fi was first this is feel like here I

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.440 
Wi-Fi was first this is feel like here I
don't<00:01:48.619> take<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.189> out<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.759> don't<00:01:49.850> drive<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.119> bike

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
don't take it out we don't drive a bike

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.270 
don't take it out we don't drive a bike
so<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:51.380> kind<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.590> like<00:01:51.680> one<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.920> those<00:01:52.070> things

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
so it's kind of like one of those things

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.890 
so it's kind of like one of those things
where<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:52.610> like<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:52.940> what<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.180> do<00:01:53.360> drive<00:01:53.690> it

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's kind of like a bike that's the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.020 
it's kind of like a bike that's the
fastest<00:01:56.240> yeah<00:01:56.799> so<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:58.460> could<00:01:58.580> want<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.850> lose

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030

fastest yeah so you could want to lose
the<00:01:59.270> sensation<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.170> speed<00:02:00.680> did<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.670> get<00:02:01.850> used

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
the sensation of speed did you get used

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.510 
the sensation of speed did you get used
to<00:02:02.270> things<00:02:02.479> yeah<00:02:02.810> yeah<00:02:03.110> years<00:02:03.950> ago<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.280> had<00:02:04.490> a
