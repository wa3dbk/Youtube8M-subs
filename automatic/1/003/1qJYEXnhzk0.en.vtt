00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
going to be real pain so I think I first

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.670 
going to be real pain so I think I first
want<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.380> ahead<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.220> chest<00:01:12.680> just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
want to go ahead and make a chest just

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
want to go ahead and make a chest just
so<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.950> move<00:01:14.220> everything<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> my

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
so I can move everything that's in my

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
so I can move everything that's in my
inventory<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:15.840> because<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> be

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
inventory now because it's going to be

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
inventory now because it's going to be
tough<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.700> collect<00:01:18.060> everything<00:01:18.450> inside<00:01:18.869> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tough to collect everything inside that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.800 
tough to collect everything inside that
chest<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> move<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:21.479> might<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
chest and move it so this might be the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320 
chest and move it so this might be the
easiest<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.770> anyway<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.060> let's<00:01:24.180> go

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
easiest way for now anyway so let's go

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.170 
easiest way for now anyway so let's go
ahead<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.759> let's<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.850> over<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
ahead and do that let's go over here and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.179 
ahead and do that let's go over here and
play<00:01:27.479> some<00:01:27.570> chess<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.920> we'll

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
play some chess I think for now we'll

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.200 
play some chess I think for now we'll
just<00:01:29.689> put<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.869> why<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:32.210> alright

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
just put it right here why not alright

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.810 
just put it right here why not alright
and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.560> forget<00:01:35.369> an<00:01:35.549> office

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and then we got to do I forget an office

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
and then we got to do I forget an office
there<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:37.140> called<00:01:37.350> shift-click<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
there we go it's called shift-click and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.359 
there we go it's called shift-click and
there<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:39.560> do<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.070> that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
there we go I do not know about that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.310 
there we go I do not know about that
until<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.820> couple<00:01:41.970> weeks<00:01:42.090> ago<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.720> that's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
until a couple weeks ago and that's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
until a couple weeks ago and that's
really<00:01:43.710> convenient<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:45.240> makes<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
really convenient because it makes it so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
really convenient because it makes it so
much<00:01:45.780> easier<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.130> puts<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
much easier to you know that puts up in

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.910 
much easier to you know that puts up in
or<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:49.700> your<00:01:50.700> inventory<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.860> I'll<00:01:52.860> just

or out of your inventory so I'll just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
or out of your inventory so I'll just
put<00:01:53.189> everything<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
put everything in there just for now is

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.649

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
of building its day time now but so i

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.620 
of building its day time now but so i
think<00:03:29.980> i'm<00:03:30.430> going<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.580> do<00:03:30.700> now<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.209> I'm<00:03:31.480> not

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
think i'm going to do now is I'm not

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.860 
think i'm going to do now is I'm not
sure<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:33.400> like<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:33.970> wanted<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.660> make

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
sure but like this I wanted it to make

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.430 
sure but like this I wanted it to make
it<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:36.160> know<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.520> mobs<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.880> come<00:03:37.120> at<00:03:37.270> me

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it so you know the mobs that come at me

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.320 
it so you know the mobs that come at me
will<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:39.160> know<00:03:39.280> have<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.700> go<00:03:39.820> up<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.120> set<00:03:40.300> of

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
will you know have to go up a set of

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.930 
will you know have to go up a set of
stairs<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.750> guess<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.290> way<00:03:41.560> it's<00:03:41.980> harder<00:03:42.910> than

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
stairs I guess this way it's harder than

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.330 
stairs I guess this way it's harder than
they<00:03:43.180> get<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.450> me<00:03:43.570> in<00:03:43.750> which<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.980> makes<00:03:45.220> it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
they get to me in which that makes it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.850 
they get to me in which that makes it
easier<00:03:45.580> for<00:03:46.000> me<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.090> fight<00:03:46.420> them<00:03:46.660> hopefully<00:03:46.959> so

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
easier for me to fight them hopefully so

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.310 
easier for me to fight them hopefully so
let's<00:03:48.400> hope<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.670> works<00:03:49.120> I'm<00:03:49.840> running<00:03:50.200> low<00:03:50.290> on

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
let's hope that works I'm running low on

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440 
let's hope that works I'm running low on
food<00:03:50.709> because<00:03:51.040> i<00:03:51.100> canna<00:03:51.310> tag<00:03:51.580> last<00:03:51.940> time<00:03:52.180> my
