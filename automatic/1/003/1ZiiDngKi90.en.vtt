00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 what you're up friends how are the years 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.870
 doubles welcome again to my channel 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 and we continue with what would be the week 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 of screen savers like 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.859
 can see now I bring you what would be 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.199
 a completely different protector 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.420
 last week as this is 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.519
 flexible but still the same 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 company that is called haylock like 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 we can see really I liked it 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.300
 quite what are the protectors of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 this company since it offers what it is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 true protection in the part of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 back we're going to find the ones that are a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.469
 little specs speaks to us 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.520
 also a little bit of what is the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.280
 protector and we see that it resists those who 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 are impacts also resists what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.379
 the truth is that these 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 protectors are pretty good and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.070
 believe me I recommend it we go to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.609
 take it out of here that is a little bit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.380
 stuck but that's where it came out now let's see 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.470
 everything that brings us 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.250
 remember first we see the installation and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.950
 above all it is important to read it since 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.860
 the way for us to stay better at 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.660
 our protector is reading devote a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.720
 time to what would be the guide of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 installation so when we go here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 as you can see bring different and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.640
 it really makes me quite different 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.210
 to others when it comes to putting it so 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.490
 we are going to read it and above all we are going to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 see what else brings we see what brings what 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.630
 is the protector really looks slim 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.580
 and as you can see it will be inflexible more 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.250
 hereinafter I will also teach 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.810
 brings what are stickers for that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 I tell them there it is important to read the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 installation to know what is going to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.500
 serve those stickers here in this 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.440
 little bag we see that it brings what would be the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.840
 blanket to clean them and also bring 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.630
 what are some stickers to collect the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.520
 speck or the garbage or the hairs that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 has our screen let's take out the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.750
 protector so we can see it a lot 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.950
 best 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.220
 let's get it out of this little bag 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.709
 a good now how can we see the truth 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.650
 it feels very light and what is very 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.440
 thin but other than that as they can 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.629
 see is very flexible it also offers a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.760
 great protection as I said in what 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.290
 it was in the back of the box here 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.390
 is in fast camera what is the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.090
 installation so that you give yourself a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.640
 idea of how to put it and how it works and 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.180
 how it looks but as always remember 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.099
 You already owe it, we clean it, we can pick it up 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 the little hairs that leaves the same wipe 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.650
 I really like that and now we're going to 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.959
 start what it is to put it for this 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.319
 they served what are the stickers that we 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.380
 bring so we can align it well and 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.410
 so we stay aligned here as you can 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.140
 see either line and you put a sticker of 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.810
 there we go with the other so that does 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.150
 that the phone does not move and you 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.920
 make us much easier when 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 put what is our protector and 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.250
 Be well aligned as you can see 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.300
 really here it was pretty 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.360
 aligned as we're going to see 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.940
 ok now let's remove this so that 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.800
 you can see how it is going 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.470
 remember to be sure before 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.710
 line it up because afterwards it's a bit 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.650
 complicated to what is to align it there 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.200
 we are going putting it we were pulling it to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.650
 that is what is aligned now 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.440
 half time put if you notice 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.930
 they can still move it and if 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.970
 find the point that you want 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.400
 that stays well aligned as per 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.819
 example to me and it was perfect as 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.900
 can you really see 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.269
 we already started to turn off what is 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.659
 Tighten it so that it is without bubbles and 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.810
 is well really put that is 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.430
 practice and as I always say first 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.560
 make sure it is well aligned 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.969
 so they do not have this kind of 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.250
 problems and good if we say les not them 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.519
 is aligned and have already removed what is 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.070
 the second the second stage of so that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.770
 get stuck do not worry do it 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.169
 slowly so that it fits 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.840
 aligned that's important to take the 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.150
 time and calmly so that he stays 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.300
 well and it is the result that we 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.220
 we hope now we are going to remove it what 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.890
 it would be the first 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.770
 the first plastiquito that brings so that 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.690
 let's see how it looks like they can see 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.600
 looks pretty good the colors look 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.540
 perfect really this protector does not 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.900
 feel do not feel or be there 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.150
 responds well and as you can see observe 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.180
 you do not even look at what is the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.430
 protector let's see it from this profile 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.280
 for you to see is that really 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.129
 do not feel do not feel what is the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.139
 protective 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.839
 and we are protecting what is our 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.869
 screen as you remember this protector 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:15.629
 screen is very strong and holds 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:17.759
 quite endures what is falls and 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.679
 hits good I hope we owe them everything 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.419
