00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
came into Google in 2004 when Google

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.549 
came into Google in 2004 when Google
acquired<00:00:41.340> my<00:00:41.730> company<00:00:42.149> key<00:00:42.420> ball<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.379> made

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
acquired my company key ball and we made

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.729 
acquired my company key ball and we made
the<00:00:43.680> core<00:00:43.920> technology<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> spent<00:00:46.559> about

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the core technology so I spent about

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
the core technology so I spent about
seven<00:00:47.370> years<00:00:47.520> inside<00:00:48.110> building<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.289> maps<00:00:50.660> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
seven years inside building up maps the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
seven years inside building up maps the
company<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:52.980> recently<00:00:53.399> we've<00:00:53.670> been

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
company but more recently we've been

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
company but more recently we've been
exploring<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.719> Niantic<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> idea<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
exploring and Niantic the idea of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.389 
exploring and Niantic the idea of
combining<00:00:56.280> location<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.390> mobile<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.649> games

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.119 

so<00:01:02.399> ingress<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.710> location-based<00:01:04.710> game<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so ingress is a location-based game is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.080 
so ingress is a location-based game is
that<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.760> description

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that is that the right description

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
that is that the right description
should<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.470> than<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.920> like

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
should it be bit more than bit more like

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.260 
should it be bit more than bit more like
a<00:01:08.189> shoe<00:01:08.250> based<00:01:08.430> game<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> how<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
a shoe based game is it how would you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
a shoe based game is it how would you
describe<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.350> ingress<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.610> mobile

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
describe what is ingress is a mobile

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
describe what is ingress is a mobile
game<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.659> based<00:01:12.960> around<00:01:13.200> location

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
game that's based around location

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
game that's based around location

world<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> mobile<00:01:38.909> game<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.450> live<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
world for the mobile game to live in to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.319 
world for the mobile game to live in to
kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.619> increase<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.310> emotional<00:01:42.060> kind<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
kind of increase the emotional kind of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
kind of increase the emotional kind of
resonance<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.200> game<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.590> guess<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.520> could

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
resonance of the game I guess you could

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
resonance of the game I guess you could
think<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.299> similar<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.079> cutscenes

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
think of it as similar to like cutscenes

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.249 
think of it as similar to like cutscenes
in<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.040> typical<00:01:47.670> video<00:01:47.880> game<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:49.110> thought

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
in a typical video game but we thought

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
in a typical video game but we thought
that<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> great<00:01:49.920> way<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that was a great way to kind of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.719 
that was a great way to kind of
compliment<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> mobile<00:01:51.720> experience<00:01:52.729> so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
compliment the mobile experience so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.249 
compliment the mobile experience so
there's<00:01:53.880> been<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.570> previous<00:01:54.750> there's<00:01:55.110> been<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
there's been in previous there's been a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.109 
there's been in previous there's been a
number<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.619> communication<00:01:56.579> based<00:01:56.729> games<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
number of communication based games that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.370 
number of communication based games that
have<00:01:57.210> gained<00:01:57.420> some<00:01:57.719> sort<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> niche

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
have gained some sort of kind of niche

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.330 
have gained some sort of kind of niche
appreciation<00:01:59.100> it<00:02:00.000> seems<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:01.130> genre<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
appreciation it seems to be a genre that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
appreciation it seems to be a genre that
to<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.000> view<00:02:03.240> anyway<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.750> falling

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to my view anyway is kind of falling

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.490 
to my view anyway is kind of falling
away<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.180> kind<00:02:06.420> of

away a little bit but you you kind of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.839 
away a little bit but you you kind of
think<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.920> still<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.190> lot<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> opportunity

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
see true innovation you see fits and

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.470 
see true innovation you see fits and
starts<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:20.970> saw<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.239> with

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
starts and you know you saw that with

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.210 
starts and you know you saw that with
everything<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.200> personal<00:02:22.530> computer<00:02:23.010> to

the cell phone to the search engine to
online<00:02:25.620> mapping<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:27.090> see<00:02:27.269> early<00:02:27.690> entrants

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
online mapping so you see early entrants

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.720 
online mapping so you see early entrants
that<00:02:28.379> innovate<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:28.950> some<00:02:29.160> way<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.489> then<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that innovate in some way and then you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.580 
that innovate in some way and then you
see<00:02:29.910> things<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.360> expand<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> concept<00:02:31.379> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
see things that expand the concept and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.780 
see things that expand the concept and
finally<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.160> something<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.640> really

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
finally you see something that really

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.460 
finally you see something that really
proves<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.360> out<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.440> know

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
proves it out and you see you know

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.530 
proves it out and you see you know
mainstream<00:02:34.950> adoption<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.549> think<00:02:36.209> with<00:02:36.330> games

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
mainstream adoption I think with games

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.180 
mainstream adoption I think with games
that<00:02:36.720> involve<00:02:37.049> location<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.739> think<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> time

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that involve location I think the time

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.009 
that involve location I think the time
is<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.819> people<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> right

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
is right I think people have the right

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.390 
is right I think people have the right
hardware<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.769> think<00:02:41.010> we've<00:02:41.160> learned

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
hardware and I think we've learned

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.759 
hardware and I think we've learned
enough<00:02:41.549> about<00:02:41.819> how<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> make<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.080> experience

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
enough about how to make that experience

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.500 
enough about how to make that experience
that<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.940> gonna<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.299> some<00:02:45.480> great

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that we're gonna see some great

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.690 
that we're gonna see some great
compelling<00:02:46.290> games<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.739> involve<00:02:47.099> movement

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
compelling games that involve movement

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.270 
compelling games that involve movement
and<00:02:47.940> location<00:02:48.530> we're<00:02:49.530> seeing<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:50.130> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
and location we're seeing you know this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.420 
and location we're seeing you know this
convergence<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.150> things<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.950> health<00:02:53.190> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
convergence of things in the health and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.550 
convergence of things in the health and
fitness<00:02:53.549> side<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.299> wearable<00:02:54.690> devices<00:02:54.720> as

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
fitness side and wearable devices as

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.229 
fitness side and wearable devices as
well<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.790> there's<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.090> lot

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
well so I think you know there's a lot

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.819 
well so I think you know there's a lot
of<00:02:57.360> interest<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.840> bringing<00:02:58.200> these<00:02:58.319> things

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
of interest in bringing these things

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.780 
of interest in bringing these things
together<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.579> new<00:03:00.000> fun<00:03:00.420> experiences<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
together and new fun experiences so the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.130 
together and new fun experiences so the
other<00:03:02.910> thing<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.150> location-based<00:03:03.569> games<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
other thing with location-based games is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.350 
other thing with location-based games is
partly<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.370> lot<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:05.940> conference's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
partly because a lot of the conference's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.699 
partly because a lot of the conference's
are<00:03:06.480> there<00:03:06.599> whenever<00:03:06.870> I've<00:03:07.170> heard<00:03:07.470> someone

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
are there whenever I've heard someone

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.990 
are there whenever I've heard someone
talking<00:03:07.860> about<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.220> new<00:03:08.340> location-based<00:03:08.700> game

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
talking about a new location-based game

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.850 
talking about a new location-based game
they'll<00:03:09.239> fire<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.019> map<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> San<00:03:10.500> Francisco

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
they'll fire up a map of San Francisco

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.780 
they'll fire up a map of San Francisco
and<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.010> look<00:03:11.190> at<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> people<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.670> San

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
and go look at all the people in San

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.039 
and go look at all the people in San
Francisco<00:03:12.060> playing<00:03:12.269> my<00:03:12.329> location-based<00:03:12.720> game

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
Francisco playing my location-based game

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.750 
Francisco playing my location-based game
but<00:03:13.650> I'm<00:03:13.769> clearly<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.099> world<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.459> not<00:03:14.549> based

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
but I'm clearly the world it's not based

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.369 
but I'm clearly the world it's not based
in<00:03:14.819> separate<00:03:15.150> Cisco<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.629> what's<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.200> kind<00:03:16.349> of

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
in separate Cisco so what's the kind of

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.069 
in separate Cisco so what's the kind of
global<00:03:16.560> spread<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.160> your<00:03:17.489> players<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.079> other

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
kind of kind of I guess communities

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.250 
kind of kind of I guess communities
probably<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.190> right<00:04:02.280> word<00:04:02.489> well<00:04:03.389> I<00:04:03.660> was

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
probably the right word well I was

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.400 
probably the right word well I was
involved<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:04.950> making<00:04:05.400> an<00:04:05.700> MMO<00:04:06.120> way<00:04:06.959> back<00:04:07.200> in

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
involved in making an MMO way back in

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.460 
involved in making an MMO way back in
the<00:04:07.500> 1990's<00:04:07.859> like<00:04:08.400> ancient<00:04:08.639> Israel<00:04:09.000> but<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.900> had

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
the 1990's like ancient Israel but I had

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.080 
the 1990's like ancient Israel but I had
seen<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.709> kind<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.099> emergence<00:04:11.669> social

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
seen that kind of emergence social

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.790 
seen that kind of emergence social
behavior<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.840> clans<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
behavior of clans and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.100 
behavior of clans and
Geils<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.640> all<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
Geils and all of that you know that that

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.660 
Geils and all of that you know that that
entails<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.650> MMOs<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.160> think<00:04:17.340> that's<00:04:17.519> what

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
entails and MMOs I think that's what

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.539 
entails and MMOs I think that's what
makes<00:04:17.820> them<00:04:18.030> fun<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:19.769> were<00:04:19.890> going<00:04:20.190> for<00:04:20.489> that

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
makes them fun so we were going for that

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.220 
makes them fun so we were going for that
with<00:04:20.970> ingress<00:04:21.360> we<00:04:21.600> felt<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:21.930> we<00:04:22.110> were<00:04:22.140> kind

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
with ingress we felt like we were kind

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.890 
with ingress we felt like we were kind
of<00:04:22.440> setting<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.800> stage<00:04:22.830> for<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.400> but

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
of setting the stage for that but

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.180 
of setting the stage for that but
frankly<00:04:24.900> I've<00:04:25.200> been<00:04:25.350> really<00:04:25.530> surprised<00:04:26.010> that

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
frankly I've been really surprised that

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.990 
frankly I've been really surprised that
the<00:04:26.430> degree<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.730> which<00:04:26.850> people<00:04:27.300> seem<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.200> like

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
the degree to which people seem to like

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.280 
the degree to which people seem to like
having<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.150> kind<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.390> social<00:04:30.750> engagement<00:04:30.930> I

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
having that kind of social engagement I

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.350 
having that kind of social engagement I
knew<00:04:31.620> people<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.370> real<00:04:32.520> world<00:04:32.550> you

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
knew people but in the real world you

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.670 
knew people but in the real world you
know<00:04:33.390> which<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:33.750> really<00:04:34.020> different<00:04:34.200> than<00:04:34.380> just

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
know which is really different than just

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.960 
know which is really different than just
meeting<00:04:34.890> somebody<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.430> chatting<00:04:35.700> with<00:04:35.730> them

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
meeting somebody and chatting with them

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.060 
meeting somebody and chatting with them
online<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.780> we<00:04:37.080> weren't<00:04:37.290> sure<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.620> people

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
online and we weren't sure that people

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.890 
online and we weren't sure that people
would<00:04:38.160> make<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.490> leap<00:04:38.700> of<00:04:38.880> wanting<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.600> meet

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
would make the leap of wanting to meet

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.110 
would make the leap of wanting to meet
and<00:04:40.170> play<00:04:40.410> with<00:04:40.620> new<00:04:40.890> people<00:04:41.190> versus<00:04:41.850> kind<00:04:42.060> of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
and play with new people versus kind of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.630 
and play with new people versus kind of
their<00:04:42.240> existing<00:04:42.600> friends<00:04:43.020> online<00:04:43.890> but<00:04:44.040> people
