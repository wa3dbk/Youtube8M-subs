00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.819
 Here is such a shock absorber is a sport 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.420
 so Kotovich 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.420
 Kotovich inserted here in this tube 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.360
 here is its total length 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.000
 [music] 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.660
 here it rests on the rack from 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.170
 eights 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.120
 from the standard trim bottom piece here 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.990
 threaded top cut off 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.050
 to keep shock absorbers fixed 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.750
 what is possible here and 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.750
 so too 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.850

 rolled nut fixed 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.370
 specific length 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.810
 I do not know here are gentle 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.330
 here here the points are visible such it is welding and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.510
 Clutches on the bottom of the rack from 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.770
 standard 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.270
 so spring cup with rear struts 8 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.060
 hand water 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.909
 I will have these cups 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.930
 here well and the central part did so 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.760
 so that the shock absorber is ok here through 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 gap cheeks with such steps still blogs 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.070
 I'm on top 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.730

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.730
 everyone can 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.250
 but it stiffness springs molded here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.250
 such a small stand 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.570
 [music]
