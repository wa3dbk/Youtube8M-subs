00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.580
 hello I'm never schalit I'm 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.170
 design and decoration consultant 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.910
 from the apartment and I'm going to 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.400
 suggest some small tips for 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.939
 choose furniture for a small studio 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.130
 for example for the sofa it is necessary 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.920
 choose a sofa that is not too 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.450
 important too large preferably 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.090
 smoothly is there are deals 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.940
 currently on the market design 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.860
 very interesting contemporary and there 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.410
 I chose a very small sofa of two 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.470
 places with a push that we can put 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.770
 front or side and that allows 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.930
 to leave the space quite airy 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.200
 not to take too much hold 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.480
 bulky on the space for tables 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.579
 we're not going to have a big table 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.230
 know that sometimes we are good at 2 in 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.360
 a studio but we can also receive 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.090
 guests so I opted for a 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.520
 small round table for the little ones 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.789
 lunches and dinners and then I 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.260
 opted for an expandable console there are 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.299
 currently on the market that are 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.100
 very interesting who goes against a 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.630
 wall and after we shoot we put 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.700
 extensions as we want and we can 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.440
 welcome his guests for the chairs 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.610
 for example I took chairs too 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.850
 who are very aerial easa know that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.220
 the folder is worked as a 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.780
 sculpture but does not take volume 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.369
 they can stack 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.400
 they can arrange themselves around the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.080
 table so that's again 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.990
 choose something that does not take 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.729
 no volume and that is enough 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.970
 minimalist and also for example for a 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.280
 office there is a very small space in 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.939
 the room that is reserved for this space 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.939
 working 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.759
 so we'll take a glass plate 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.680
 simple with trestles and 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.020
 trestles at right angles rather than 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.840
 trestles removed and it will still take 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.000
 less space and efficiency of the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.650
 function is quite likely 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.320
 so every time we choose the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.790
 furniture we will already refer to the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.170
 ceiling height which is quite low 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.450
 here so we do not see things 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.579
 Too soon too big 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.140
 we will try to see in relation to 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.689
 space always with a small plane 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.590
 millimeter the footprint of each 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.050
 element 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.720
 and we will dispatcher it in this space 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.080
 consistently and according to the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 different uses or to try to 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.470
 really do the minimum 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.209
 here you have some elements of 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.230
 thinking is worth choosing your furniture 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.230
 for a small studio 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 and
