the<00:00:06.450> red<00:00:06.630> fire<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.410> neat<00:00:07.710> new<00:00:07.890> tool<00:00:08.160> that

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
the red fire is a neat new tool that

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.850 
the red fire is a neat new tool that
measures<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:09.030> fast<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.840> all<00:00:09.990> spins<00:00:10.410> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
measures how fast of all spins and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.750 
measures how fast of all spins and
revolutions<00:00:11.580> per<00:00:11.639> second<00:00:13.039> speed<00:00:14.039> is<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:14.580> name

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
revolutions per second speed is the name

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.970 
revolutions per second speed is the name
of<00:00:14.789> the<00:00:15.000> game<00:00:15.150> -<00:00:15.840> things<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> ball<00:00:16.680> move

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
of the game - things like a ball move

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.430 
of the game - things like a ball move
the<00:00:17.580> speed<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.090> spin<00:00:18.360> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.020> direction

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
the speed of the spin in the direction

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.340 
the speed of the spin in the direction
of<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.859> spin<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.390> measure<00:00:21.570> kids<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
of that spin so we measure kids and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.080 
of that spin so we measure kids and
revolutions<00:00:22.860> per<00:00:22.920> second<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.640> fast<00:00:23.910> they're

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
revolutions per second how fast they're

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
revolutions per second how fast they're
spinning<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> ball<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.560> I've<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> give

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
spinning the ball and I've got to give

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
spinning the ball and I've got to give
them<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.340> plan<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.820> increasing<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> speed<00:00:27.690> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
them a plan for increasing the speed of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.020 
them a plan for increasing the speed of
that<00:00:28.140> spin<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:31.560> Texas<00:00:31.890> pen<00:00:32.070> trainer<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> new

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that spin the Texas pen trainer is a new

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.279 
that spin the Texas pen trainer is a new
tool<00:00:33.329> that's<00:00:33.660> come<00:00:33.899> out

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
tool that's come out

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.010 
tool that's come out
it<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.770> skill<00:00:35.280> specific<00:00:36.090> strength<00:00:36.660> building

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it is skill specific strength building

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
it is skill specific strength building
we're<00:00:37.739> taking<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.130> forearm<00:00:38.670> wrist<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
we're taking the forearm wrist and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
we're taking the forearm wrist and
fingers<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.020> developing<00:00:40.440> strength<00:00:40.770> specific

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
fingers and developing strength specific

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000 
fingers and developing strength specific
to<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.180> guns<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.560> our<00:00:43.710> best

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to these guns that we do in our best

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.510 
to these guns that we do in our best
bench<00:00:44.220> pitches<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.500> break<00:00:46.710> applied

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
bench pitches so with the break applied

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
bench pitches so with the break applied
Brittney's<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.300> 30<00:00:49.140> repetitions

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
Brittney's going to do 30 repetitions

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.000 
Brittney's going to do 30 repetitions
really<00:00:50.489> fast<00:00:50.880> up<00:00:51.030> her<00:00:51.300> eyes<00:00:51.480> ball<00:00:51.860> then<00:00:52.860> we

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
really fast up her eyes ball then we

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.880 
really fast up her eyes ball then we
take<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> stick<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> has<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.180> great<00:00:54.510> guns

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.549 
take the stick that has no great guns
and<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.130> 15<00:00:56.700> super<00:00:57.540> fast<00:00:57.809> spins<00:00:58.170> but

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and we do 15 super fast spins but

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.190 
and we do 15 super fast spins but
quality<00:00:59.100> spoons<00:00:59.460> put<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> fall<00:01:00.360> through<00:01:00.630> so

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
quality spoons put the fall through so

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.930 
quality spoons put the fall through so
we'll<00:01:01.350> demonstrate<00:01:01.500> ten<00:01:02.130> and<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.610> few<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we'll demonstrate ten and then a few of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170 
we'll demonstrate ten and then a few of
these<00:01:03.149> okay<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.619> rise<00:01:04.890> ball<00:01:05.250> first<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:05.939> gonna

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
these okay so rise ball first I'm gonna

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.510 
these okay so rise ball first I'm gonna
hold<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.509> tight<00:01:06.719> and<00:01:07.350> rise<00:01:07.649> one<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.189> three
