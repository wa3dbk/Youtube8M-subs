00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
what you're looking at here was the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.710 
what you're looking at here was the
coronal<00:01:05.610> mass<00:01:05.700> ejection<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.390> couple<00:01:06.630> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
coronal mass ejection from a couple of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
coronal mass ejection from a couple of
days<00:01:06.810> ago<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.409> might<00:01:07.860> remember<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
days ago you might remember this is the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
days ago you might remember this is the
forecast<00:01:09.180> track<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> shows<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> completely

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
forecast track that shows it completely

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 
forecast track that shows it completely
missing<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.189> side<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.970> pretty

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
missing to one side I think it's pretty

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
missing to one side I think it's pretty
easy<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.350> ejecta<00:01:13.890> coming

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
easy to see that there is ejecta coming

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
easy to see that there is ejecta coming
out<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.520> sides<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:15.270> ejecta

out of all sides and when there's ejecta
coming<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.290> sides<00:01:16.619> there's<00:01:17.280> some

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
coming out of all sides there's some

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
coming out of all sides there's some
coming<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.390> behind<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> disc<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
coming right at you behind the disc so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
coming right at you behind the disc so
that<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> second<00:01:20.939> coronal<00:01:21.330> mass<00:01:21.450> ejection

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that is the second coronal mass ejection

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.300 
that is the second coronal mass ejection
that<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.710> first<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.130> should

doesn't<00:01:25.200> show<00:01:25.470> any<00:01:25.710> signs<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.340> slowing<00:01:26.549> down

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
doesn't show any signs of slowing down

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
doesn't show any signs of slowing down
whatsoever<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.540> had<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> bunch<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.229> em<00:01:28.409> flares

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
whatsoever we had a bunch of em flares

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.740 
whatsoever we had a bunch of em flares
you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> probably<00:01:29.939> expect<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> continue

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you can probably expect that to continue

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.560 
you can probably expect that to continue
now<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.270> big

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
now have a look at how much this big

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.140 
now have a look at how much this big
sunspot<00:01:33.900> morphs<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> last<00:01:35.490> 48

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
sunspot morphs and this is the last 48

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
sunspot morphs and this is the last 48
hours<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> pretty<00:01:37.590> serious<00:01:37.920> folks<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hours this is pretty serious folks it is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
hours this is pretty serious folks it is
definitely<00:01:39.799> dangerous<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.340> earth

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
definitely dangerous and the earth

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
definitely dangerous and the earth
footprint<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.810> top<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.409> that's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
footprint is right over top of it that's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.620 
footprint is right over top of it that's
not<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> big

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
not what we like to see now that big

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.980 
not what we like to see now that big
sunspot<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.860> labeled<00:01:47.189> beta<00:01:47.490> Delta<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
sunspot is labeled beta Delta now you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
sunspot is labeled beta Delta now you
might<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.320> wondering<00:01:49.350> where<00:01:49.979> did<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> gamma

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
might be wondering where did the gamma

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.230 
might be wondering where did the gamma
go<00:01:50.820> well<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.290> gamma<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.820> classification

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
go well the gamma is a classification

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
go well the gamma is a classification
that<00:01:54.600> says<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.020> can't<00:01:55.259> really<00:01:55.470> draw<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
that says well you can't really draw a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800 
that says well you can't really draw a
line<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.310> between<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.000> polarities<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
line in between the polarities but you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
line in between the polarities but you
can<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.560> last<00:01:58.950> night<00:01:59.280> look<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
can see here this is last night look you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.819 
can see here this is last night look you
can<00:02:00.270> drop<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.600> line<00:02:00.869> directly<00:02:01.350> between<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
can drop this line directly between the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.139 
can drop this line directly between the
blue<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> red<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.850> very<00:02:03.090> very

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
blue and the red and it's very very

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.880 
blue and the red and it's very very
clear<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> looks<00:02:04.770> like

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
clear now this is what it looks like

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
clear now this is what it looks like
this<00:02:05.070> morning<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> no<00:02:06.270> longer<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> case

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
this morning that is no longer the case

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.210 
this morning that is no longer the case
and<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.649> say<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:07.950> is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and I'm going to have to say this is

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.460 
and I'm going to have to say this is
back<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.610> Beta<00:02:08.879> Gamma<00:02:09.270> Delta<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.319> as

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
back to Beta Gamma Delta and just as

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.080 
back to Beta Gamma Delta and just as
dangerous<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.250> was<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.670> put<00:02:11.940> off<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
dangerous as it was when it put off the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.890 
dangerous as it was when it put off the
X<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
X and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.259 
X and
Flair's<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:14.159> that's<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> news<00:02:14.579> folks<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:15.060> do

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
Flair's so that's the news folks we do

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.030 
Flair's so that's the news folks we do
have<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.689> earth<00:02:15.840> footprint<00:02:16.379> on<00:02:16.500> top<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.920> that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
have the earth footprint on top of that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
have the earth footprint on top of that
mega<00:02:17.459> region<00:02:17.939> up<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.269> top<00:02:18.480> left<00:02:18.780> we're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
mega region up on the top left we're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.380 
mega region up on the top left we're
still<00:02:19.739> waiting<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.310> major<00:02:20.730> events<00:02:21.209> from<00:02:21.329> the

still waiting for major events from the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.759 
still waiting for major events from the
coronal<00:02:21.810> hole<00:02:21.930> stream<00:02:22.260> although<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.590> does

coronal hole stream although it does

coronal hole stream although it does
appear<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.280> might<00:02:23.610> miss<00:02:23.849> us<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.569> don't

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
appear that that might miss us we don't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.809 
appear that that might miss us we don't
have<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.959> whole<00:02:25.170> lot<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.379> magnetic<00:02:26.370> filaments
