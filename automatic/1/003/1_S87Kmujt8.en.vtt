about<00:01:54.200> fire<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:55.250> how<00:01:55.400> I<00:01:55.430> did<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.820> all

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
about fire but that's how I did it all

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.740 
about fire but that's how I did it all
the<00:01:56.060> way<00:01:56.450> over<00:01:57.340> except<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:59.300> here<00:01:59.360> but

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
the way over except for right here but

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.520 
the way over except for right here but
that's<00:01:59.870> because<00:02:00.020> that's<00:02:00.290> where<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
that's because that's where the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.710 
that's because that's where the
fireplace<00:02:00.800> is<00:02:01.040> going<00:02:01.490> in<00:02:01.670> certain<00:02:02.360> spots<00:02:03.400> I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
fireplace is going in certain spots I

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
fireplace is going in certain spots I
don't<00:02:05.720> know<00:02:05.810> much<00:02:05.960> about<00:02:05.990> fire<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:06.620> that

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
don't know much about fire but that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.690 
don't know much about fire but that
seems<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.070> work<00:02:07.509> which<00:02:08.509> ones<00:02:08.840> for<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:10.459> ones

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
seems to work which ones for the ones

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.210 
seems to work which ones for the ones
that<00:02:10.940> weren't

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.890 

because<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.340> did<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.850> accident<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.720> don't

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
because I did it on accident I don't

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.780 
because I did it on accident I don't
even<00:02:16.960> realize<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.470> until<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.580> I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
even realize it until just now that I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.240 
even realize it until just now that I
did<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:25.200> okay<00:02:26.200> yeah<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.890> makes<00:02:27.010> more<00:02:27.130> sense

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
did it okay yeah that makes more sense

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.540 
did it okay yeah that makes more sense
that<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:29.560> right<00:02:29.710> you<00:02:30.340> can<00:02:30.460> do

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
that it's like that all right you can do

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.520 
that it's like that all right you can do
this<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:30.730> whatever<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.900> think<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.410> looks

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
this with whatever but I think it looks

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.210 
this with whatever but I think it looks
best<00:02:32.710> with<00:02:32.860> brick<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:35.560> fill<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:35.980> holes

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
best with brick just fill in the holes

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.700 
best with brick just fill in the holes
basically<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:40.210> looks<00:02:40.390> also<00:02:41.260> another<00:02:41.590> thing

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
basically it looks also another thing

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.890 
basically it looks also another thing
that<00:02:41.980> looks<00:02:42.130> better<00:02:42.550> if<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.510> sits<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.830> is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that looks better if it sits if it it is

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.020
