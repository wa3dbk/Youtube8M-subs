00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
a building facade a panel which can be

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.800 
a building facade a panel which can be
of<00:03:50.950> course<00:03:50.980> any<00:03:51.400> design<00:03:51.850> we<00:03:52.060> want<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.420> put<00:03:52.600> on

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
of course any design we want to put on

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.069 
of course any design we want to put on
it<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.109> beside<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.980> here<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:55.079> vehicle

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
it and beside it here we have a vehicle

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.160 
it and beside it here we have a vehicle
barrier<00:03:56.890> now<00:03:57.160> that's<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.549> 500-pound<00:03:58.269> block<00:03:58.810> we

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
barrier now that's a 500-pound block we

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.930 
barrier now that's a 500-pound block we
do<00:03:59.380> have<00:03:59.590> them<00:03:59.799> in<00:03:59.920> different<00:04:00.040> sizes<00:04:00.760> you

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
do have them in different sizes you

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.090 
do have them in different sizes you
notice<00:04:01.570> at<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.840> ends<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.500> get<00:04:02.620> under<00:04:02.859> for

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
notice at the ends you can get under for

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.310 
notice at the ends you can get under for
a<00:04:03.130> forklift<00:04:03.609> to<00:04:03.820> lift<00:04:04.000> them<00:04:04.209> here<00:04:04.900> we<00:04:05.019> have<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
a forklift to lift them here we have the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.099 
a forklift to lift them here we have the
block<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.799> showing<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.340> earlier<00:04:06.400> which<00:04:07.000> is

tackle now this is for use in seismic

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.960 
tackle now this is for use in seismic
sensitive<00:04:10.810> areas<00:04:11.290> or<00:04:11.470> perhaps<00:04:11.680> by<00:04:12.400> military

that<00:04:31.199> it<00:04:31.470> would<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.740> together<00:04:31.919> now<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:32.789> it<00:04:32.970> was

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
that it would be together now if it was

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.839 
that it would be together now if it was
seismic<00:04:34.110> sensitive<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.889> rocks<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.550> mortar

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
seismic sensitive and rocks the mortar

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.430 
seismic sensitive and rocks the mortar
may<00:04:36.000> break<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.509> here<00:04:36.720> but<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:36.990> still<00:04:37.229> holds

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440

but I think one of the things that you

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.790 
but I think one of the things that you
should<00:04:57.569> consider<00:04:58.139> is<00:04:58.259> we<00:04:58.409> can<00:04:58.590> color

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
should consider is we can color

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.559 
should consider is we can color
coordinate<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.550> homes<00:04:59.789> we<00:05:00.120> could<00:05:00.300> make<00:05:00.449> the

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
coordinate the homes we could make the
