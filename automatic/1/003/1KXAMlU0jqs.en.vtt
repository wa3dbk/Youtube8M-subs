00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 television more environment than ever 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.030
 well today is Friday of pets and the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 today we have a great surprise that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 well I think josefo my dear boss today 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.020
 we have this exotic animal an animal 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 properly Mexican who is in danger 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.320
 of extinction as you see let's talk about 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 the axolotls and it seems we have our 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.890
 expert gustavo kings gustavo like 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.730
 we are so very good girls guys 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.010
 days 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 today more than talking about a pet we are going 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.039
 to talk about an animal that is in 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 danger of extinction and that 100% Mexican 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 and well, what is the importance of knowing 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 to the animals that also here in the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.100
 federal district is originating nothing else 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.079
 of xochimilco two lakes of sushi and good 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 has helped a lot in research 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.890
 eight days ago we talked about the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 stem cells we could not say that of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 they thank them is that we have today 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 in day all this part of research 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.059
 with regenerating stem cells 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.690
 organ regeneration tissues 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.190
 thanks to axolotls the mythical others 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 prehispanic writings in that encounter 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.809
 also very specific descriptions 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.579
 they are all from before the time 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.989
 pre-Hispanic and there was the electrician 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.880
 that this diver in this case please 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.420
 present thus is it accompanies us the day of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.250
 today 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 from which he comes from neighborhood 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.950
 unam a place also tinkay where 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.479
 can go on to investigate or know 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.490
 the species breeds national and varied and we 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.119
 is going to talk closer to the axolotl and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.119
 how can we keep it 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.530
 so it's good if it's important to know 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.330
 that this species is endemic to our 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.009
 country does not mean that it is not in 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 no other part of the world so 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.539
 natural or wild and from our city 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.280
 and our city negatively and that 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.259
 it is therefore representative of our 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.140
 pre-Hispanic culture our culture 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.289
 current and that's why it's one of the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 important neuralgic points for 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.270
 to be able to keep it alive in the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.950
 bookstore that unfortunately for 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.719
 occasions 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.460
 of pollution and destruction of their 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.560
 habitat is being lost is always 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.789
 this species is not species kept 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 in this stage it is known as cap 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.590
 larval larval and in them it presents a 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.210
 phenomenon that is called neotenia means 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 that can be reproduced at this stage 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.160
 there are other species not other but if 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 they have to lose the gills 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 develop lungs to serve a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.069
 aerial means and being able to reproduce what is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.390
 what people are asking you 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.970
 right now the difference between 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.730
 tadpole and axolotl perfectly the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.040
 tadpole is the larval stage of the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.860
 frogs and toads that if they put the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.470
 Eggs are born the tadpole suffers 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.959
 process of metamorphosis and they will be 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.079
 examines lose the tail and pass to a 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.329
 air life of 40 lots not them not a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.760
 amazing change chapter 11 of the 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.049
 way they can benefit 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.579
 ecosystems so that people 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.370
 also stop and understand the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.900
 importance of taking care of the ok are 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.400
 important because they go or how they belong 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.160
 like any other organism to the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.300
 food chain are controllers of 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.920
 several 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.120
 several species that can be considered 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.840
 pests and that in turn they equal 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.420
 belong to a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.850
 the hip that can also be prey 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.600
 of other organisms that when losing the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.640
 they would eat something that is super 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.410
 It is important to mention that not all 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.480
 weight we met met one 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 function but in this part of the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.110
 amphibians an indicator a thermometer of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.880
 how is an ecosystem are just 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.680
 the simple any kind of amphibian 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.290
 it tells you if the ecosystem is good 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 if the water the air the earth will 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.650
 they are in perfect condition 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.610
 when they are no longer as there are 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.610
 talking about there is a problem 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 the one that has red 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:52.920
 the most beautiful animals has seen a 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.510
 AndrÃ©s Neuman public moment that 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.110
 approached the axolotls arrived who saw him 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.110
 known face that has 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.050
 So yes 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.420
 this is good for them life 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.580
 wild can be scored I repeat from 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:26.880
 insects other fishes other long and 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:30.410
 other long and in turn the laboratory 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.120
 they are given from the brightness of this 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:38.130
 little piece of liver 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.590
 carmen is recommended to have them as 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.810
 pet at home 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.060
 not only send them as much as photos 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.450
 because the people that there are people who 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.710
 like to have your fish tank 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.030
 they can be in the park of the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.520
 we are going to be a collection in favor 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.680
 Hostel Don kayak from 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:06.470
 11 in the morning food because it 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.470
 he will thank you very much more than ever
