00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.880
 Please Zelda Ocarina of Time to save his Creator 1 yes 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.799
 Cardona small clearly my of the tree Serbian Endeavor 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.699
 I would not have any problems with that I find too different a friend with 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.909
 Sparkling wine for example Philippines or CEE d 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.989
 and because he buys that satisfactorily so you can know right 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.100
 what it was all about CeBIT 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.150
 For example, taken pictures and four times more expensive 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.140
 Georg Reichert 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.200
 and percent one sees similarities he sweat percent certainly 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.530
 Of course it's great that she can copy 1 1 and that's a process 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.320
 certainly also 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.390
 no stone can look exactly the same that would not be possible 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.520
 Something like maybe not even percent fish and nice but im 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.820
 that it is not possible but of course percent tests I test 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.020
 Press original as possible 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.629
 but I just look forward to all Troy's gone was the story 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.570
 And disappointing is that it happened to us that was different underground 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 Percent of chronological order remains and different and the AHV the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.330
 same now not too long before tournaments but 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 tell that I have not flowed that instead of immediately came because of me 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 a little something was missing 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.950
 a little bit that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.260
 work with adventure force so 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.470
 you know obviously or the people who have already created maps and 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.950
 so on there is luck and then with the comb was a function 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 do and so on and percent with it percent 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.010
 per year 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 so I have a few problems yes and would have more 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.850
 Year old I ask you the best I can now because in bed or something 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.390
 yes, that's of course that's great for me or him 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.240
 but I do not need it so well I'm just looking for a changed one 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.479
 explaining how to insert scud AP can not even write to us 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.820
 both 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.430
 should only insert English can those who do not share with percent one 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.240
 Do not begrudge connect may have been functional for years that is it was 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 important for me how to do that year I've got one from it 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.009
 Law with all the stuff and I finished the biggest parts but yes 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.860
 this whole thing is shared and so it's a little strange so you need it 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.549
 please 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.150
 to single volunteers who clarify with Darko 1% how to do something so years 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.689
 de would like to have one 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.290
 Per cent I like to write the reports man chaplain if you want then you can 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 you talk writing or other years so as I said 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.059
 that's nice if it can clarify a short series and so on 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.959
 and Dr 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.729
 but then do not know 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.059
 In the first part, of course, one percent Cookie Lite will take care of that 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.159
 completely finished 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.929
 the lost forests make it too dangerous 2 percent 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.379
 and there will be no labyrinth and then the forest temple 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.639
 So that then everything is ready then of course I have completely in the 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.859
 Cuban finished 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.790
 the function Final as well as that still means 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.089
 very good luck 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.629
 and then I do not know if I'll do the parts with Zeller now 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.069
 If the animal wants to run to the bow second then it must of course be able to 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.359
 his Wulff keeps normal second and percent 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.149
 I have to see how far we come 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.179
 but I will be the first part too fast as possible 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:14.309
 then release it so that you can test it Medi Bags should drop percent 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.949
 or similar suggestions he so that he his first few 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.409
 can play and so on or if you come later then the second part 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.059
 where we practically displaced already percent as I want to do it 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.059
 Ivey then we show Pons tight like that 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.120
 normal to watch 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.390
 Han walking staff Sittauer beaten with the old Vettel and then had to bus 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.590
 continue to play the story, "Wengi reported 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.599
 best in the minus 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.730
 thanks to finding good transition so 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.779
 Dormann pooled percent of July and not yet 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.059
 that, of course, it already finished everything there are the difficulties 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.219
 and i just wanted to get help with the whole sketches since i need a two 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:54.949
 People are wonderful 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.999
 know Herne whether the harvest I wanted to say yes Schumer thank you that is 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:00.999
 arrived 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.839
 and see you in the next life
