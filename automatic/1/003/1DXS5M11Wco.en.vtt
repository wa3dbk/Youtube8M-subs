00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
its kind in cellular PVC there are other

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
its kind in cellular PVC there are other
soffit<00:00:44.730> systems<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.539> made<00:00:45.809> from<00:00:46.050> from

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
soffit systems out there made from from

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
soffit systems out there made from from
other<00:00:46.860> vinyl<00:00:47.160> products<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.850> fiber<00:00:48.149> cement

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
other vinyl products or fiber cement

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
other vinyl products or fiber cement
this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> only<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.890> cellular<00:00:50.340> PVC

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this is the only one in a cellular PVC

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.750 
this is the only one in a cellular PVC
so<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> rigid<00:00:51.449> form<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.320> PVC<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.190> installs

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so it's a rigid form of PVC and installs

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.959 
so it's a rigid form of PVC and installs
in<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> snap<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.770> 18<00:00:56.190> foot<00:00:56.460> long<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
in a snap and it's 18 foot long so it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
in a snap and it's 18 foot long so it
reduces<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.600> joints<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.649> vented<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.250> give

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
reduces the joints it's vented to give

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.040 
reduces the joints it's vented to give
you<00:00:59.520> ten<00:00:59.730> inches<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> free<00:01:00.300> air<00:01:00.449> space<00:01:00.780> per

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you ten inches of free air space per

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
you ten inches of free air space per
lineal<00:01:01.320> foot<00:01:01.559> makes<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> best

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
lineal foot makes it one of the best

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
lineal foot makes it one of the best
airflow<00:01:03.000> systems<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> market<00:01:03.780> today<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
airflow systems in the market today and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
airflow systems in the market today and
it<00:01:04.979> comes<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> freeze<00:01:06.689> board<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it comes with a with a freeze board and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.250 
it comes with a with a freeze board and
a<00:01:07.740> fascia<00:01:08.040> piece<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.150> store<00:01:09.900> grooved

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
a fascia piece that is not store grooved

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
a fascia piece that is not store grooved
to<00:01:10.860> allow<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> soffit<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.880> slide<00:01:12.150> right

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
to allow the soffit to just slide right

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
to allow the soffit to just slide right
in<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> makes<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.470> easy<00:01:13.650> assembly<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
in so it makes for easy assembly on the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.090 
in so it makes for easy assembly on the
job<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> soffit<00:01:15.960> system<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.409> kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
job so the soffit system is kind of the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.499 
job so the soffit system is kind of the
new<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.520> we've<00:01:17.759> introduced<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.450> at

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
snowstorm in the Northeast I think

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.160 
snowstorm in the Northeast I think
that's<00:02:15.640> holding<00:02:15.880> some<00:02:16.030> people<00:02:16.269> back<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
that's holding some people back but you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.080 
that's holding some people back but you
know<00:02:17.260> we're<00:02:17.410> fairly<00:02:17.739> optimistic<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.430> think<00:02:18.670> you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
know the market is starting to recover I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.560 
know the market is starting to recover I
think<00:02:21.430> there's<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.700> little<00:02:21.850> renewed<00:02:22.120> optimism

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
think there's a little renewed optimism

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.620 
think there's a little renewed optimism
I<00:02:22.870> think<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.200> think<00:02:23.640> 2011<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.820> think<00:02:25.390> people

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
I think I think 2011 I think people

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.970 
I think I think 2011 I think people
think<00:02:25.810> we're<00:02:26.019> working<00:02:26.170> off<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.530> bottom<00:02:26.830> now

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
think we're working off the bottom now

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.110 
think we're working off the bottom now
we're<00:02:27.160> feeling<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.489> little<00:02:27.580> bit<00:02:27.790> better<00:02:27.940> about

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we're feeling a little bit better about

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.570 
we're feeling a little bit better about
where<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.920> think<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.220> traffic

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
where it's going so we think the traffic

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.280 
where it's going so we think the traffic
will<00:02:30.700> pick<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:31.959> should<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
will pick up and and we should have a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.590 
will pick up and and we should have a
good<00:02:32.440> show
