00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
necklaces the pendants don't come off

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.670 
necklaces the pendants don't come off
they're<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.380> safety

they're like have like a safety

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.979 
they're like have like a safety
mechanism<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.550> they<00:02:41.880> don't<00:02:42.000> come<00:02:42.630> off<00:02:42.810> at

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
mechanism so that they don't come off at

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.229 
mechanism so that they don't come off at
all<00:02:43.110> or<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.100> necklace<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.730> pendant<00:02:44.760> is

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
all or like this necklace the pendant is

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.759 
all or like this necklace the pendant is
attached<00:02:45.570> straight<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.110> middle<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.709> you

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
attached straight in the middle so you

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.050 
attached straight in the middle so you
couldn't<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.130> change<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> chain<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.760> this

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
couldn't really change the chain on this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150 
couldn't really change the chain on this
so<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.420> extenders<00:02:48.840> are<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> lifesaver<00:02:49.260> here's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
so the extenders are a lifesaver here's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.650 
so the extenders are a lifesaver here's
another<00:02:50.370> combination<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.480> like

to put with this was another stone so
you<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.720> see<00:04:34.900> how<00:04:35.080> these<00:04:35.230> two<00:04:35.590> necklaces<00:04:35.800> kind

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
you can see how these two necklaces kind

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.560 
you can see how these two necklaces kind
of<00:04:36.370> go<00:04:36.430> together<00:04:36.580> because<00:04:37.030> they're<00:04:37.180> both<00:04:37.360> just

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
of go together because they're both just

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.410 
of go together because they're both just
solitaire<00:04:38.220> like<00:04:39.220> stone<00:04:39.580> necklaces<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.330> then

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
solitaire like stone necklaces and then

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.180 
solitaire like stone necklaces and then
this<00:04:40.690> one<00:04:40.900> helps<00:04:41.110> tie<00:04:41.350> in<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.740> silver<00:04:42.070> one

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
this one helps tie in with a silver one

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.830 
this one helps tie in with a silver one
because<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.670> diamond<00:04:43.000> does<00:04:43.150> kind<00:04:43.420> of<00:04:43.510> shine

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
because the diamond does kind of shine

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.870 
because the diamond does kind of shine
like<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.260> silver<00:04:44.620> color<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.430> they<00:04:45.580> all<00:04:45.700> go

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
like that silver color so they all go

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.520 
like that silver color so they all go
together<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.540> really<00:04:46.750> can't<00:04:46.990> go<00:04:47.110> wrong<00:04:47.140> with

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
together you really can't go wrong with
