00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
your right foot that goes and slams on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.179 
your right foot that goes and slams on
the<00:02:03.509> brakes<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> motorcycle<00:02:04.680> that's

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the brakes and for a motorcycle that's

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.520 
the brakes and for a motorcycle that's
what<00:02:05.399> controls<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.450> down<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
what controls you know down here the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.430 
what controls you know down here the
rear<00:02:07.740> brake<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.450> when<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
rear brake and when you do that you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.650 
rear brake and when you do that you
start<00:02:10.530> locking<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
start locking up the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.530 
start locking up the
can<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.990> go<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.320> a<00:02:12.470> skid<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.090> have<00:02:14.330> done

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
can you go into a skid and I have done

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.750 
can you go into a skid and I have done
that<00:02:14.690> before<00:02:15.070> when<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.100> first<00:02:16.370> started<00:02:16.640> writing

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
that before when I first started writing

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180 
that before when I first started writing
so<00:02:17.120> that's<00:02:17.810> one<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> other<00:02:18.620> mistakes<00:02:19.040> that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
so that's one of the other mistakes that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.040 
so that's one of the other mistakes that
I<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.430> made<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:20.150> too<00:02:20.360> much<00:02:20.510> pressure<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
I have made is too much pressure on the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.900 
I have made is too much pressure on the
bright<00:02:21.350> on<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.890> back<00:02:22.070> brake<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.520> always<00:02:22.760> want

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
bright on the back brake you always want

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.580 
bright on the back brake you always want
to<00:02:22.940> put<00:02:23.120> most<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> pressure<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> front

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
to put most of the pressure on the front

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.650 
to put most of the pressure on the front
that's<00:02:25.400> where<00:02:25.670> you're<00:02:25.790> gonna<00:02:25.910> stop<00:02:26.240> just<00:02:26.510> like

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
that's where you're gonna stop just like

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.780 
that's where you're gonna stop just like
a<00:02:26.690> car<00:02:27.080> that's<00:02:27.860> where<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.040> foam<00:02:28.220> brakes<00:02:28.580> are

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
a car that's where the foam brakes are

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.340 
a car that's where the foam brakes are
bigger<00:02:29.030> on<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.240> motorcycle<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.900> front<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.290> I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
bigger on a motorcycle in the front so I

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.110 
bigger on a motorcycle in the front so I
the<00:02:30.410> front<00:02:30.680> brakes<00:02:30.890> are<00:02:31.040> bigger<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> car<00:02:31.940> in

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the front brakes are bigger on a car in

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.970 
the front brakes are bigger on a car in
the<00:02:32.180> front<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:33.110> because<00:02:33.470> we're<00:02:33.710> all<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
the front that's because we're all the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.890 
the front that's because we're all the
stopping<00:02:34.400> power<00:02:34.550> comes<00:02:34.880> from<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.690> need<00:02:35.840> to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
stopping power comes from so you need to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.180 
stopping power comes from so you need to
balance<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.380> out<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.740> didn't<00:02:36.920> make<00:02:37.040> sure

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
balance that out you didn't make sure

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.700 
balance that out you didn't make sure
that<00:02:37.310> you're<00:02:37.490> able<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.850> come<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:38.960> guys<00:02:39.140> get<00:02:39.350> it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
you apply equal pressure we're just not

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.000 
you apply equal pressure we're just not
really<00:02:50.780> equal<00:02:51.049> Varsha<00:02:51.319> I'm<00:02:51.439> sorry<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.799> you

balance your bike out you can kind of

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.890 
balance your bike out you can kind of
feel<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.400> weight<00:02:58.670> shift<00:02:59.000> when<00:02:59.720> you're

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
feel the weight shift when you're

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.660 
feel the weight shift when you're
braking<00:03:00.379> too<00:03:00.560> much<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> front<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:01.549> going

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
braking too much in the front it's going

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.670 
braking too much in the front it's going
to<00:03:01.790> learn<00:03:01.970> forward<00:03:02.480> when<00:03:03.079> you're<00:03:03.200> braking<00:03:03.530> too

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
to learn forward when you're braking too

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.050 
to learn forward when you're braking too
much<00:03:03.829> in<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.040> back<00:03:04.189> you're<00:03:04.459> gonna<00:03:04.519> run<00:03:04.819> into<00:03:04.849> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
much in the back you're gonna run into a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.119 
much in the back you're gonna run into a
skidding<00:03:05.510> motion<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.560> back<00:03:06.739> end<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:06.980> gonna

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
skidding motion the back end is gonna

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.399 
skidding motion the back end is gonna
start<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.459> slide<00:03:07.730> out<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.750> that's<00:03:08.959> not<00:03:09.170> good

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
start to slide out and that's not good

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.899 
start to slide out and that's not good
so<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.799> that's<00:03:10.099> one<00:03:10.340> other<00:03:10.489> thing<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.879> look

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
so that that's one other thing to look

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.349 
so that that's one other thing to look
out<00:03:11.150> for<00:03:11.680> another<00:03:12.680> thing<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.280> kind<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.120> go<00:03:14.329> out

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
out for another thing to kind of go out

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.690 
out for another thing to kind of go out
for<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.349> how<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.530> practice<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.159> just<00:03:16.340> go

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
for is and how you practice that just go

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.699 
for is and how you practice that just go
to<00:03:16.760> go<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.599> empty<00:03:18.019> parking<00:03:18.319> lot<00:03:18.470> and

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
to go to a empty parking lot and

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.000 
to go to a empty parking lot and
practice<00:03:18.859> your<00:03:19.159> emergency<00:03:19.670> braking<00:03:21.010> another

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
practice your emergency braking another

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.099 
practice your emergency braking another
thing<00:03:22.159> that<00:03:22.310> catches<00:03:22.489> new<00:03:23.269> riders<00:03:23.629> a<00:03:23.659> lot<00:03:23.900> is

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
thing that catches new riders a lot is

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.930 
thing that catches new riders a lot is
slow<00:03:24.470> speed<00:03:24.769> maneuvers<00:03:25.159> so<00:03:25.310> maneuvering

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
slow speed maneuvers so maneuvering

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.190 
slow speed maneuvers so maneuvering
within<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.480> parking<00:03:26.989> lot
