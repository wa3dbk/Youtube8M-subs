really wanted to surpass that today but
um<00:01:59.390> just<00:02:00.390> wasn't<00:02:01.320> thereby<00:02:01.590> tempted<00:02:02.719> 335<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.490> I

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.999 
um just wasn't thereby tempted 335 and I
buried<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.719> came<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:07.020> it's
