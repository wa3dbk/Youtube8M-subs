00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.829
 [Music] 

00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 or 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:20.169
 within what is also the house of 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.179
 I change the engine although the engine 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.880
 aesthetically it is of series then it 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.650
 works with diameters of pistons pumps 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.419
 and ccoo to get maximum power 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.630
 apart from the entire anti-roll system 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.899
 which is super reinforced we carry with 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.520
 the entire instrumentation table 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.370
 we carry a tablet where really 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.620
 I have a temperature control of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.490
 brakes temperature 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 turbo pressure engine 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.420
 water pressure the forwards 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.309
 they pressed rear brakes 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.890
 there is a connection simply with the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.550
 by walkies team but of course 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.229
 they are careers that do not leave time 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.989
 no kind of fix or step by pit 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.750
 lane and step in the pits we talk about weights 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.690
 minimum not maximum minimum weight 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.540
 with a pilot inside 5000 has inverted 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.300
 distributed the weighing jump by wheel 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.730
 then it makes the front axle never 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.590
 can have less than 3,300 kilos that 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.240
 implies that the rear axle can not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.220
 have never less than 2200 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.880
 the truck is around six meters long 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.799
 and it has a width of 250 that measure 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.430
 is controlled by the guide can not be 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.289
 greater than 255 in fact because when 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.570
 the more width you have the more 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.909
 stability you have there can not be anything 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.710
 not even a fiber bumper to 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.479
 less than 20 centimeters of sudoku 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 They have grade or cubic centimeters 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.240
 power of more than 1,000 horses and 1100 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.100
 there will be me and the other officers 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 they have here in the speed and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.369
 starts about 70 kilometers 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.640
 per hour which is a bit the speed of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.179
 exit 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.549
 we do from 170 to 160 which is the 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.500
 limitation not because it changes is not 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.590
 others but because of dangerousness at the time 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.600
 of the circuit of accidents of departures 70 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.319
 at 160 kilometers we are talking about 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.770
 four and a half seconds 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.370
 less than 5 seconds and it's pity 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.120
 speed limit around 100 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.770
 meters the brakes around 400 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.390
 degrees the biggest problem is the 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.100
 brake temperature that's why we have it 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.040
 controlled by telemetry but you have to 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.960
 be very careful because all disc of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.330
 brake that passes more than 400 degrees supposes 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.940
 a disc break and automatically 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.560
 strip discard the truck can very much 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.260
 you put a longer gap and you are able to 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.700
 correct if you put me not with a formal or 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.500
 no but closing buy another type of 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.840
 car a little more affordable then 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.840
 we will loose enough to say
