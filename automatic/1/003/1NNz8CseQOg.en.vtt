00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.229
 hello everyone today I'm going to do hair 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.120
 moisturizer for aloe vera skin 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:10.120
 for this I have an aloe leaf 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.510
 and a big sheet 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.150
 and there's a sheet the court makes a couple of 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.640
 hours and now I'm going to take out the gel that 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.720
 has in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.720
 good for this I'm going to cut a bit 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.429
 we go by parties 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.470
 we count 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.470
 they are the thorns 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.340
 we cut the leaf in half 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.210
 and with the help of a 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.660
 and with the help of one of a stick of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.190
 wood or a spoonful let's go 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.360
 taking out this 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.360
 this aloe pulp 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 and so we proceed with all or 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.540
 as you know 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.540
 It has many many properties 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.220
 Healing is also used for the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.310
 skin care for the care of the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.310
 hair 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.570
 or what we are going to do is a gel 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:09.180
 for the body as well as for the hands 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.180
 for the face and for the whole body 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.250
 this is the amount of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.680
 he played in the guilt of something he took out and now 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.409
 I'm going to process it in a processor 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.109
 then there are four ingredients 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:32.640
 needed to make the aloe gel 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:32.640
 vera is the gel grape seed oil 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.610
 a 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.840
 pastillite and vitamin c oil 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.670
 argan good to the pulp added 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.670
 a vitamin c pill 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.680
 the vitamin is served so that our 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.680
 gel is preserved for longer 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.469
 we mix it a little 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.120
 I add grape oil 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.659
 about three or four tablespoons 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.659
 a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.090
 4 enough 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.950
 grape oil acts as a merchant and 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.620
 I will also add argan oil 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.650
 which is rich in vitamin C softens the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.650
 skin 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.250
 it protects it from dryness also 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.720
 regenerate 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.980
 and I'm going to add about 10 15 drops of 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.980
 argan oil 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.080
 we mix everything well and this gel what 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.280
 we keep in refrigerator 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.280
 in a glass jar 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.070
 It can be saved perfectly by up to 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.740
 one month is stored well in the attic what 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.340
 we use 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.340
 about like a gel on the face the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.410
 hands and good all over the body after 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.150
 of the shower can also be used 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.380
 as an angel of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.380
 a gel for the skin 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.550
 I just ran out of this shampoo that 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.129
 I'm using for my hair and good 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.460
 I decided to store the gel in this container in 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:41.699
 this bottle wash it well 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.759
 here as you see is the gel the gel before 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.350
 to use it you have to remove it because the 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.080
 oil 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.040
 is not up and the gel down then 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.040
 shake it well 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.669
 I open here 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.760
 with small enough 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.880
 not for 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.880
 apply on hands 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.970
 Always keep it in the refrigerator a month 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.889
 One month can be saved perfectly 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.310
 good we see in the next video 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.310
 bye Bye
