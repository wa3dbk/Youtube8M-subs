00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 pegi 18 to some spectators 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.480
 could find the images that are going 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 to follow violent or shocking 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:18.930
 here are warned hello everyone 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.090
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.929
 here we are on battles cops at one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.759
 little a little video on the a630 so 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.679
 I will give you my impressions I 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.849
 do not know if you tested it you have 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.439
 the opportunity to test or just 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.820
 so specific for a new war 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.400
 who just went out so just 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.140
 I do not want to put you to do 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.340
 rather hope since I do not know if 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.989
 sure of other cards I do not have 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.120
 necessarily preview but it is not 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 necessarily there c 130 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.199
 in any case it makes me really happy 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 to be able to show you that the c 130 is 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.010
 good for the guy who inside and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.289
 that it is super abuse for the troops 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.129
 terrestrial it's really a player for 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.010
 them so you're going to get back 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 account that already we have three passengers 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 with us so there are three powers of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.320
 fire on the enemy at least I read canon 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.090
 the heaviest after others 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 opponents will line up in fact everything 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 simply one he can shoot a big one 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.320
 shell of a larger mm it's me in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.510
 the occurrence approaches to that one that there 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.290
 can draw 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.000
 mid-range obts the dude just down 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.340
 and after his target and burst no 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.460
 believe me they have almost no 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.660
 luck he can already feel you have 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.650
 seen overtaking the master 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.790
 he climbed over the mirador mac is 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.740
 what he's getting there I'm going to swing the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.310
 smaller print shop and the guy did 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.020
 nothing seen coming 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.220
 and again I'm not necessarily precise 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 because you have to know that it's shaking 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.340
 not bad anyway what do you like to see 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.510
 you are in the air so I think 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.220
 that there is a little bit bull reads 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.960
 years and that's frankly well thought out 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.190
 so the same I use have more than 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.130
 luck huh that's why I wanted 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.600
 really or proposed by a this little 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.610
 extra this little feat in section and that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.870
 like that I would say by the extra small 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 gameplay excerpt 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.050
 I did not want any gameplay either 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.430
 who tell me about ac 130 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.350
 I wanted you to advocate alone 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 objective or frankly for those who 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.479
 have tested do not hesitate to tell me 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.380
 really what do you think 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.840
 I think it's 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.850
 frankly nice but for the troops 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.110
 on the ground knowing that I am often alone 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.950
 I am very rarely and several 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.840
 others this little gadget we will say in 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.209
 helicopters in the air etc 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.370
 I'm more focused on goals the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.020
 guy for example who simply wants 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.850
 run for example look for a flag 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.080
 it's enough that you have a little clever 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.750
 which is just not 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.640
 positioned in a 130 c and the guy he 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.170
 has no chance did not want to capture 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.120
 it's all the areas on this map 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.650
 are uncovered 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.480
 that's what come to make bread so 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.400
 it wakes up anyway because there is 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.690
 a few points where we can still 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.180
 captured but against the island 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.250
 main I'm hardly 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.730
 moved you do not really have a field 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.280
 very small action and I think that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.720
 who really wants to avoid the 530 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.269
 I want to honestly break friends of 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.400
 that she was going on the big map at 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.930
 middle with after course the 530 will be able 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.880
 you get out of here but 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.260
 usually he is focused like me 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.270
 so you'll just try to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.700
 to aim 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.140
 the enemies justin so close 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 look at all that stuff all we 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.750
 can hang out it's pretty funny when 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.640
 even I find it amusing but it's 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.260
 boring enough what for the guys I play 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.180
 also on both sides ie 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.830
 that I realize that the guy who 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.480
 wants to start or that had happened to me 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.470
 on battlefield he's going to see this case 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.100
 but what's all this stuff that's 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.630
 falls on the mouth 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.680
 unfortunately these three little ones 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.190
 friends who got on a plane 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.630
 and who is strafing him from the sky and I 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.520
 think you have almost no chance 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.930
 to know where this is a small stick 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.400
 so that's not small boats I 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.320
 would it be a firepower 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.840
 exceptional this kind of small boat 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.220
 so little web we can call it like 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.790
 that you will see in my next 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.050
 gameplay 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.170
 I will try to show you my card 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.910
 with this kind of ship the mini ships 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.800
 and believe me with without making a 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.050
 maximum carnage he has almost no 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.910
 luck that the bad enemy and who you 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.800
 shoot bassil bus trip 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.900
 let survive watch unfortunately 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.160
 he has no chance of survival and there 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.780
 you saw it's my teammates neither 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.130
 trellis on the city ​​of almost no 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.170
 chance to kill him 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.370
 who is running away 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.090
 what can I kill him there 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.760
 he beat and assistance, but 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.080
 co-pilot the small missiles 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.670
 see here in peace simply this 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.790
 lightning that are programmed to shoot down 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.140
 planes the planes that disrupted 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.030
 goal more is actually born 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.680
 accelerates the pace to be able to 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.940
 to knock out the aircraft carriers and as soon as the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.500
 aircraft carrier and degumming 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.000
 there will be a hunt that will open at 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.680
 from that moment on you can 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.330
 to launch an assault is simply 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.100
 engaged in the fight to 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.260
 charges or explosives and do 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.110
 blow up the aircraft carrier so that you 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.150
 can meet the victory so 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.650
 it's not very complicated the tab that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.290
 you could see just what is 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.070
 finished so the aircraft carrier carrier 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.260
 the c 130 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.460
 basset exploded in the air or parts 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.350
 which you still have it lasts very 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.880
 for a long time, huh, it's a little 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.290
 abused so I 'm going to parties about you 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.000
 films in any case for those who me 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.689
 ask for the length of time it can 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.219
 last between the 15th 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.039
 goals rather we'll say even ten minutes 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.369
 until after 25 after that it happens very 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.929
 rarely 

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.339
 it must happen it depends on the tickets 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.839
 but for now it's still 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.009
 correct enough we learn in more than 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.259
 parties that will last three hours like 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.249
 his battlefield 3 a lot of subscribers me 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.379
 say but is it the same as 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.519
 his battlefield 3 knowing that they they 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.219
 have not known simply the 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:11.599
 servers by unknown forces all 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.369
 simply the custom servers where 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.689
 people to buy the server is everything 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:16.639
 just what he did if you want 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.610
 they would put their anthem and and their 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.039
 settings to their own settings 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.179
 simply in fact the days the 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.519
 joints that did not necessarily know 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:27.110
 cold wan get together more than one 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:29.599
 hour more than two hours and it was 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.589
 frankly not nice at all so 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.729
 that's why a lot of them 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:32.629
 are going to ask me the gameplay how many 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.539
 time just lasts 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.979
 his body is a blow to the small one 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.899
 but I hope it made you 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.789
 really enjoy this little niamke enough 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:43.219
 fast so it was more centered 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.499
 frankly smile 737 the palaver 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.209
 between all the goals and not either 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.329
 something that was centered on what 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:52.399
 on the mode of himself and so the monoi 

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:53.959
 even there is an effect that in preparation 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:55.969
 but we purists who really make me 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.379
 pleasure but there c 130 do not hesitate to 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.269
 debate on the comments it's done 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.009
 for between 300 for those who have tested 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:03.139
 do not hesitate to say it and your 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.899
 impressions on both sides ie 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.229
 on the side of the person who inside 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:10.550
 who commands there c 130 and the little side 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.839
 victims ie we actually 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.979
 find terrestrial what are you in 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.939
 think etc etc 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.319
 English are still other 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.150
 software that is doing 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.910
 phenomenon damage 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.320
 in any case, but do not hesitate 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.090
 really to communicate about that 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.830
 and I think you'll hear at 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.360
 many with regard to life as 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.010
 inter you want them to pose the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.730
 question what are the tribes that 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.660
 had been 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.640
 so that's why I'm trying to do 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.020
 really very wide videos without no
