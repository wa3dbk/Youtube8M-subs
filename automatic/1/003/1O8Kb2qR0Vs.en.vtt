Poli showing you how to a hop automatic

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.349 
Poli showing you how to a hop automatic
farm<00:00:16.949> with<00:00:17.100> hoppers<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.789> new<00:00:17.940> snapshot

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
farm with hoppers and the new snapshot

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630 
farm with hoppers and the new snapshot
running<00:00:18.990> right<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.430> eventually<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.490> will

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
running right now eventually this will

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
running right now eventually this will
be<00:00:21.140> released<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:23.330> full<00:00:24.330> update<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
be released as a full update but this is

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.109 
be released as a full update but this is
pretty<00:00:25.590> much<00:00:25.740> an<00:00:25.980> automatic<00:00:26.519> farm<00:00:26.820> not

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
pretty much an automatic farm not

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
pretty much an automatic farm not
completely<00:00:27.720> automatic<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
completely automatic but you can make it

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.359 
completely automatic but you can make it
automatic<00:00:28.980> by<00:00:29.460> doing<00:00:29.760> certain<00:00:30.210> things<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:31.369> so

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
automatic by doing certain things but so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
automatic by doing certain things but so
basically<00:00:32.820> first<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
basically first if you don't know the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.340 
basically first if you don't know the
hopper<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.329> little<00:00:36.840> guy<00:00:36.960> here

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
hopper is it is this little guy here

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.540 
hopper is it is this little guy here
there<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> no<00:00:37.829> actual<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:39.469> thing<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.980> sort

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
there is no actual like thing like sort

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
throw in the top will come out the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.139 
throw in the top will come out the
bottom<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> there's<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> chest<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:53.879> or

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bottom of there's a chest there or

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.529 
bottom of there's a chest there or
something<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:57.030> throw<00:00:57.300> this

in their book and then it will go
through<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.300> chest<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
through and go to this chest is if you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
through and go to this chest is if you
use<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.620> ways<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.280> today<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.640> showing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
use a little ways but today I'm showing

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.179 
use a little ways but today I'm showing
you<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> use<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:05.299> farm<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.070> with<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you how to use it in a farm so with a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.910 
you how to use it in a farm so with a
basic<00:01:08.490> farm<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.920> wheat

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
basic farm here you know with the wheat

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
basic farm here you know with the wheat
and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.700> piston<00:01:12.600> mekanix

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and then you have your piston mekanix

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
and then you have your piston mekanix
the<00:01:13.710> mechanism<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.520> cannot<00:01:14.790> talk<00:01:15.030> today<00:01:15.240> where

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the mechanism I cannot talk today where

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
the mechanism I cannot talk today where
you<00:01:16.229> flip<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> switch<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:17.280> Pistons

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you flip the switch and these Pistons

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
you flip the switch and these Pistons
will<00:01:17.790> come<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.180> water<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> flow<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> but

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
will come down water and flow and but

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.020 
will come down water and flow and but
usually<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.400> would<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> come<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:20.850> here

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
usually you would have to come down here

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.030 
usually you would have to come down here
and<00:01:21.570> stand<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.439> collect<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and stand right here and collect all the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
and stand right here and collect all the
stuff<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> chest<00:01:24.090> not

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
stuff and then put in a chest not

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
stuff and then put in a chest not
anymore<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.380> flick<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.860> switch<00:01:26.340> band

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
anymore you just flick the switch band

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.260 
anymore you just flick the switch band
although<00:01:27.680> sweet<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> stuff<00:01:29.400> will<00:01:29.640> fall<00:01:30.000> down

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
although sweet and stuff will fall down

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.080 
although sweet and stuff will fall down
into<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.750> hoppers<00:01:34.189> just<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
into these hoppers just like that and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.230 
into these hoppers just like that and
then<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.100> comes<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
then it all comes down here into the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.069 
then it all comes down here into the
chest<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.840> once<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:41.090> falls<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> here

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
chest as once it all falls out of here

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.010 
chest as once it all falls out of here
you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.970> some<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> does<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.689> stuck

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you can see some of it does get stuck

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
you can see some of it does get stuck
sometimes<00:01:46.320> though<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> something

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
sometimes though so this is something

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.450 
sometimes though so this is something
that<00:01:47.880> will<00:01:48.060> need<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.360> fixed<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.170> Bob<00:01:49.460> some

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that will need to be fixed with Bob some

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
that will need to be fixed with Bob some
bugs<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.820> need<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.180> fixed<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.920> see<00:01:52.920> just

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
bugs that need to be fixed but see just

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.060 
bugs that need to be fixed but see just
goes<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:53.909> through<00:01:54.210> most<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> time

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
goes right through most of the time

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.709 
goes right through most of the time
that's<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.340> bug<00:01:56.820> man<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.509> need<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that's a bug man I think they need to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.090 
that's a bug man I think they need to
fix<00:01:57.990> their<00:01:58.259> so<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
fix their so so it all go down there and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.600 
fix their so so it all go down there and
then<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:06.119> falls<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.610> basically

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
then it all falls into this so basically

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.450 
then it all falls into this so basically
you<00:02:08.970> planned<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.569> stuff

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.710 

it<00:02:14.460> all<00:02:14.610> grows<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.910> were<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.420> flip<00:02:21.660> your

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
it all grows you were to flip your

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.640 
it all grows you were to flip your
switch<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.550> set<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> Pistons<00:02:24.300> off

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
switch you have to set the Pistons off

switch you have to set the Pistons off
it<00:02:25.650> all<00:02:25.920> falls<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.700> into<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:32.360> then<00:02:33.360> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
it all falls down into here and then it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.660 
it all falls down into here and then it
comes<00:02:33.690> down<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.100> simple<00:02:35.520> as<00:02:35.640> that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
comes down here so it's simple as that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.510 
comes down here so it's simple as that
and<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.690> basically<00:02:37.200> how<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.860> use<00:02:38.010> hoppers

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
and it's basically how to use hoppers

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.720 
and it's basically how to use hoppers
