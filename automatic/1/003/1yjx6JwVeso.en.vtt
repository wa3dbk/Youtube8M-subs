00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.119 
know just a lot of players are going for
less<00:02:06.960> especially<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.619> people<00:02:08.009> believe

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
less especially if people believe

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.229 
less especially if people believe
they're<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.789> team<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> year

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.970 
they're going to be in team of the year
and<00:02:09.629> that's<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.099> unexpect

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
and that's not to be unexpect

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.229 
and that's not to be unexpect
so<00:02:12.129> if<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.519> your<00:02:12.640> player<00:02:12.819> going<00:02:13.090> for

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
lasses probably because people think it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.500
