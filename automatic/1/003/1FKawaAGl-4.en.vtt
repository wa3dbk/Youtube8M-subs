00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.229 
in all the Dreamweaver made simple
tutorials<00:00:57.799> next<00:00:58.799> you'll<00:00:59.220> need<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.489> select<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
tutorials next you'll need to select the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.750 
tutorials next you'll need to select the
website<00:01:00.479> in<00:01:01.260> case<00:01:01.799> you've<00:01:01.979> got<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.430> than<00:01:02.580> one

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
website in case you've got more than one

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.930 
website in case you've got more than one
website<00:01:02.940> loaded<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:04.070> finally<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.489> simply

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
website loaded and finally you simply

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.170

download the site back to your computer

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.279 
download the site back to your computer
so<00:01:09.180> let's<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> look<00:01:09.899> at<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.200> actually

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
so let's take a look at how we actually

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.590 
so let's take a look at how we actually
do<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> using<00:01:11.430> Dreamweaver

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.480 

so<00:01:15.440> once<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.680> open<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.950> remove<00:01:16.100> you'll<00:01:16.370> need

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
so once you open to remove you'll need

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.719 
so once you open to remove you'll need
to<00:01:16.580> click<00:01:16.820> on<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.120> site<00:01:17.720> menu<00:01:18.080> option<00:01:18.729> then

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
click on new site now we won't go
