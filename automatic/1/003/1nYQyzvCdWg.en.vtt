00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
aight one and i mean there's not really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
aight one and i mean there's not really
destructible<00:01:33.630> environments<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.500> still

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
destructible environments but they still

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
destructible environments but they still
have<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.490> shoot<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> fence

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
have like you can shoot down a fence

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
have like you can shoot down a fence
when<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.440> grenade<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.980> know<00:01:38.100> rocks

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
when there's a grenade you know rocks

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
when there's a grenade you know rocks
come<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.570> look<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:39.990> bit

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
come up and make it look a little bit

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.450 
come up and make it look a little bit
more<00:01:40.350> realistic<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.010> then<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.220> might<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.370> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
more realistic and then there might be a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.620 
more realistic and then there might be a
little<00:01:41.580> indent<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.120> ground<00:01:42.330> but<00:01:42.480> there's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
little indent in the ground but there's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.870 
little indent in the ground but there's
still<00:01:42.690> no<00:01:42.990> real<00:01:43.320> destructible<00:01:44.280> environments

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
still no real destructible environments

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.390 
still no real destructible environments
so<00:01:46.040> my<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.490> guess<00:01:48.180> I'm<00:01:48.510> wondering<00:01:49.250> what's<00:01:50.250> going

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
so my I guess I'm wondering what's going

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
so my I guess I'm wondering what's going
to<00:01:50.490> happen<00:01:50.760> is<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.180> gonna<00:01:51.300> have

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to happen is are they gonna have

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.730 
to happen is are they gonna have
destructible<00:01:51.900> environments<00:01:52.440> I<00:01:52.500> mean<00:01:52.650> that's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
destructible environments I mean that's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.110 
destructible environments I mean that's
not<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.310> medal<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.550> honor<00:01:53.670> game<00:01:53.909> type

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
not really the medal of honor game type

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.510 
not really the medal of honor game type
I<00:01:54.240> hope<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.080> um<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
I hope they don't do that um and that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.180

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
if you guys don't know what hollow-point

if you guys don't know what hollow-point
does<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.400> rounds<00:03:00.850> are<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.810> tip<00:03:02.349> they

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
does is the rounds are in the tip they

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.080 
does is the rounds are in the tip they
are<00:03:02.620> actually<00:03:02.799> hollow<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.819> what<00:03:03.940> they<00:03:04.030> do

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
are actually hollow and so what they do

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.360 
are actually hollow and so what they do
is<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.540> when<00:03:04.690> they<00:03:04.840> hit<00:03:05.769> somebody<00:03:06.160> they're

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
is is when they hit somebody they're

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.820 
is is when they hit somebody they're
supposed<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.670> fragment<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.360> well<00:03:08.049> if<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
supposed to fragment and well if a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.620 
supposed to fragment and well if a
fragment<00:03:09.400> inside<00:03:09.610> your<00:03:09.760> body<00:03:09.880> that's<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.450> bad

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
fragment inside your body that's a bad

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.059 
fragment inside your body that's a bad
thing<00:03:10.810> because<00:03:11.019> then<00:03:11.380> you're<00:03:11.799> pretty<00:03:11.950> much

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
thing because then you're pretty much

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.220 
thing because then you're pretty much
screwed<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.700> need<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.269> have<00:03:13.450> surgery<00:03:13.780> tetrad

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
screwed and need to have surgery tetrad

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.150 
screwed and need to have surgery tetrad
so<00:03:14.380> that's<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.650> point<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.920> hollow-point

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
so that's the point of hollow-point

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.270 
so that's the point of hollow-point
rounds<00:03:15.370> um<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.739> doesn't<00:03:18.190> mean

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
rounds um but that doesn't mean

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.569 
rounds um but that doesn't mean
attachments<00:03:18.819> out<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.209> game<00:03:19.330> silencers

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
maybe one person on the back who's

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.510 
maybe one person on the back who's
shooting<00:05:47.409> they<00:05:47.860> can<00:05:48.009> rotate<00:05:48.280> in<00:05:48.430> any

direction but you can just ride around
on<00:05:50.199> an<00:05:50.349> ATV<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.490> it's<00:05:51.729> like<00:05:51.789> it<00:05:52.419> would<00:05:52.780> make<00:05:52.960> for

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
on an ATV so it's like it would make for

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.779 
on an ATV so it's like it would make for
an<00:05:53.259> interesting<00:05:53.469> gameplay<00:05:53.889> because<00:05:54.219> if<00:05:54.580> you

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
an interesting gameplay because if you

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.730 
an interesting gameplay because if you
have<00:05:54.909> a<00:05:54.940> map<00:05:55.449> like<00:05:55.630> this<00:05:55.690> maybe<00:05:56.440> they<00:05:56.620> would

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
have a map like this maybe they would

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.749 
have a map like this maybe they would
have<00:05:56.830> to<00:05:56.889> make<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.159> maps<00:05:57.370> a<00:05:57.460> little<00:05:57.610> bit

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
have to make the maps a little bit

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.370 
have to make the maps a little bit
bigger<00:05:57.940> but<00:05:58.270> if<00:05:58.630> they<00:05:58.780> have<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:58.900> map<00:05:59.139> like<00:05:59.319> this

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
bigger but if they have a map like this

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.379 
bigger but if they have a map like this
you<00:05:59.979> could<00:06:00.159> just<00:06:00.280> ride<00:06:00.520> around<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:01.060> capture

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
you could just ride around and capture

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.230 
you could just ride around and capture
the<00:06:01.419> points<00:06:01.750> really<00:06:01.960> easily<00:06:02.229> um<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:03.460> your<00:06:03.759> ATV
