they're effective what their goal is as

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.200

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
creating an ad that way so we identified

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.980

characteristics of effective ads we all

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170 
characteristics of effective ads we all
discovered<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> there's<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.950> recipe<00:01:08.850> for

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

today<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.520> making<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> ice<00:01:36.479> cream

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
today was about making the ice cream

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
today was about making the ice cream
today<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.290> designing<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.159> flavors<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
today was designing the flavors so the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.690 
today was designing the flavors so the
students<00:01:39.270> had<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.509> opportunity<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
students had an opportunity to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
students had an opportunity to
experiment<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.780> recipe<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.500> were<00:01:43.590> no

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
experiment with the recipe there were no

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.789 
experiment with the recipe there were no
measurements<00:01:44.689> specific<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
measurements specific to how to do it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.350 
measurements specific to how to do it
they<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.159> said<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> three

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
they just said here are the three

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880 
they just said here are the three
ingredients<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.170> students<00:01:49.439> got<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> chance

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
ingredients so my students got a chance

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.609 
ingredients so my students got a chance
to<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.759> mix<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> use<00:01:51.720> different<00:01:52.140> amounts<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to to mix and use different amounts to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.440 
to to mix and use different amounts to
try<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:52.950> design<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.180> thought

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
try and design it the way they thought

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
try and design it the way they thought
it<00:01:54.570> would<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.780> most<00:01:54.960> effective<00:01:55.579> they<00:01:56.579> then

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it would be most effective they then

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.609 
it would be most effective they then
brought<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.210> materials<00:01:57.719> from<00:01:57.869> home<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.500> they

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
brought in materials from home that they

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.060 
brought in materials from home that they
thought<00:01:58.860> would<00:01:59.130> make<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.770> delicious<00:02:01.770> ice

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
thought would make for a delicious ice

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
thought would make for a delicious ice
cream<00:02:02.399> flavor<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.780> brought<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.200> their

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
cream flavor so they brought in their

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.360 
cream flavor so they brought in their
materials

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
materials

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.870 
materials
had<00:02:05.520> an<00:02:05.640> opportunity<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:07.310> create<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
had an opportunity to create it to

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.520 
had an opportunity to create it to
position<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:09.990> really<00:02:10.200> looked

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
position it you know they really looked

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.130 
position it you know they really looked
at<00:02:10.680> it<00:02:10.740> from<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> eye<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.910> an<00:02:12.240> advertiser

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
at it from the eye of an advertiser

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.440 
at it from the eye of an advertiser
what's<00:02:13.830> going<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.190> influence<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:15.000> audience

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
what's going to influence my audience

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.250 
what's going to influence my audience
and<00:02:16.880> we<00:02:17.880> then<00:02:18.120> took<00:02:18.420> them<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.200> took

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and we then took them and I took

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.230 
and we then took them and I took
photographs<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.190> them<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.850> they<00:02:21.080> created

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
photographs of them so they created

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.790 
photographs of them so they created
foreground<00:02:24.240> they<00:02:24.510> had<00:02:24.720> props<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.590> had

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
foreground they had props they had

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.860 
foreground they had props they had
things<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.340> again<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.970> ultimate<00:02:27.090> goal<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
things to again the ultimate goal is to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.110 
things to again the ultimate goal is to
