00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.649
 8 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.180
 hello to all it was enough to watch the street races of concord 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.879
 today I present the question symposium hours available on 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.569
 the cydia store poses in 2099 service 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.929
 but the app can create a blacklist of numbers or phone 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.109
 so you do not want to know more 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.640
 all these applications 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.179
 so this is this one with tony colbert ans 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.179
 and you see here that I already have the quarter number 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.220
 this is the number of this mobile phone 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.460
 so 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.770
 I will try to make a call test to show 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 only when I want mureaux 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.400
 no call 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.690
 receipts on the phone so here is tjd phone 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.250
 I make a call 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.930
 application 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.880
 my phone but automatically in this window of 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.650
 sending sms and when 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.460
 in europe we call that I know that's what we can I do not know 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.500
 not if it's not the back to the plants 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.910
 so once upon a time you blocked the call 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.700
 you can follow him but for me it's like that when you are 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.470
 announced very simple you can click on limoux on the other hand 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 and you have two solutions be added to a contact a number of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.400
 more at the contact hourrafoot and yourself 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.250
 the number 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 to put in the blacklist so here i'm going to mark the mans and here you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.160
 must wear the number with the country code pin back at the beginning of a trailer 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.640
 country number in France and + 33 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.150
 and right after +33 you type directly the 6 or the 7 according to the 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.870
 phone number since 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.140
 new phone numbers starting with 07 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.360
 but that are typed silica and you type in resin 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.850
 this new challenge 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 poutou who will give it right 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.080
 then on abc 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.190
 that's what saw itself tgv block 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.550
 when some people can use the app you should% after 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.880
 voted a number 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 for the rest of your phone anymore so that the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.100
 the changes are taken into account so we after you have two more 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.960
 fighting in the armand pub who knows if the history of all your calls 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.589
 blocked calls actually 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.529
 to tell you they have not been 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.279
 what blue number are trying to call us in case you need to 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.499
 call him back in vain 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.309
 do they have something in france 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.489
 and the last cd and settings you have you 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.349
 here it is you who is the customer 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.739
 here it is to block all your contacts it is not at the controls 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.729
 since no one will be able to sell you of course 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.620
 and then if it's the case at euler hermes 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.079
 the ranks of the team's 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.949
 the history of the lepi his usual phone since the 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.999
 numbers that you see here are also available 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.239
 the team driver 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.879
 so we will have you bought your number and you want to unlock it 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.929
 this key reform on psx 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:53.889
 have you deleted 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.739
 the mayor 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.220
 the orient you can do with either the said and the forbidden sign either 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.369
 directly saÃ¯d and on the number 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.119
 and then who knows so quickly 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.069
 once it's over 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.679
 tool that is the question and you have to do a respring of your phone 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.359
 so that the concordat times fleet changes into account 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 and now can try to call us 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.689
 to see if the unblocking has been done 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.509
 colling phone 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.509
 normally the flag in new form 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.269
 that's how we saw people being the call 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.029
 phone 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.779
 you have to click on the bridge to refuse to 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.869
 accepted the call here again a little head walt disney for orange I do not know 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.959
 not for other operators 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.599
 and so that was the euros colloquium question to create a list 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.759
 black numbers 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.239
 you do not want to receive a call 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.899
 he understands three years earlier to say it to the test
