 Philadelphia as we all know probably 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 the progenitor of this cheese is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.029
 united states of america so its 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 there is a dime a dozen and he is very cheap with us 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.590
 until it is so common in many 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.619
 its cities are not even delivered in the afternoon with fire 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.180
 you will not find in those who have it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.620
 accordingly very expensive therefore 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.360
 let's try to cook it in 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.250
 home conditions for its preparation 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 we need 200 grams 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.730
 freshly prepared cottage cheese 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.770
 how to cook cottage cheese I already 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.239
 told in previous videos now 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 below will be a reference on how 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.410
 cook easiest cottage just 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 still suitable for our cheese 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 Philadelphia and so 200 grams 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.780
 freshly prepared cottage cheese 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 I didn't have one homemade egg fresh 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.340
 homemade chicken eggs so I took 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 3 small quail always take 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.979
 relationship one chicken egg equals three 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.060
 quail and citric acid on 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.970
 knife tip 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.150
 and a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of sugar 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 sugar and salt we put in our cottage cheese 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.600
 only we cooked cottage cheese 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 Immediately put a teaspoon 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 salt and a teaspoon of sugar and now 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 let's get to our cooking 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 cheese we take our eggs from anyone chicken one 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.189
 from universes 3 whip out should be 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.189
 cool and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.710
 churned citric acid on the tip 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.990
 the knife 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.359
 I take juice instead of citric acid 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.899
 Lemon survive here is so small 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:02:04.319
 a slice of lemon and good everything again 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:08.509
 Together we whip the recipe is very simple and 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.509
 easy therefore it turns out instantly 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:18.959
 whipped with citric acid 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:22.489
 we lay out his blend add our 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.489
 curd mass that we got 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 I got such a home curd 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.400
 cover and whip until smooth and 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.480
 so we're running about about two three 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:03.840
 minutes our philadelphia cheese now 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:06.750
 let's see what we got him than 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.329

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.660

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.660
 Philadelphia cheese 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.930
 so this is the amount of cheese 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.140
 Philadelphia we have turned out 1 liter 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.520
 milk half a liter of yogurt about 200 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.170
 gram texture as you can see creamy 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.630
 I got a little curd 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.300
 so slightly dry 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.150
 wetter than grains will be your cottage cheese 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.840
 the more creamy will be the cheese itself 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.840
 Philadelphia 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.690
