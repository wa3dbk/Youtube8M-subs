00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.250
 us last century to shine I talked about 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.160
 which is very important laying out the first 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:36.320
 finger it means pupils usually play 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:39.680

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.829
 take me smooth 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.829
 motion 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.030
 vegans 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.030
 this is going down 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.730
 why do we need a howitzer 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.230
 in order to hear the intervals 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.230
 spacing pc 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.140
 what at which potency 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.510
 for example, we long live her account 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:21.700
 which no black guy means 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:29.540
 fingering squirrel remains 3 2 1 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:33.950

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.530
 there is a table here is a table and money 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.399
 now I recommend first treating in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:45.680
 then one more when 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:53.869

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.060
 usually very deputies play 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.830
 I advise you to learn this separately 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.820
 elements then connects in this lesson I 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.410

 the seventh is called chord 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.050

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.260
 gamma house burns this first 3 5 st 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.700
 rubles

00:02:48.700 --> 00:03:00.760
 you will be on support important these steps 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:03.549
 I move the limit as such is formed 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.090
 code move where called 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.689
 treatment 2y facing boredom is over 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.590
 a place 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.450
 they will carry portable to appeal 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.970
 called without making the bottom sound 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.310
 work on alunite we talk about three 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.030
 sonorous hunting here they are on the table 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.819
 are shown 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.239
 mean fingering of these right hands 1 3 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.239
 1 2 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:43.740
 and then you can left hand it is necessary 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.580
 memorize this what these funds do 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.520
 appeals 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.330
 now i will say the appeal is 4 sonorous 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.330
 it turns out 4 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.789
 these same fingers would persist 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.840
 I also advise you to start playing weights on 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.930
 every turn then a place in this lesson I 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.060

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.939
 chord so which is preserved 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.939
