00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.410
 I am the director of a television program 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.920
 The director 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:36.440
 Well speaking briefly make a picture 1 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 It's interesting if you do this If you do this, it's not interesting to do this in that part 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:49.910
 In a meeting like that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.910
 You are the person who expresses it using the picture of how you can endure most 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.010
 Edit 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.600
 To in the editor-in-chief 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 In the picture that I made 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.460
 Ask me to insert a telop or secure me 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.890
 The last thing is that there is the strongest of being asked to fix it with a beautiful intestine 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 even though I Naa do in cg 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.650
 If you do it right at the right store, do you feel appreciable 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 Certainly the most off when you're at home 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.730
 I have a feeling 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.610
 I 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:43.590
 Since I moved to my home and started my work, I can hardly say so much 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 Without that sleeping in bed 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.100
 When I go to bed and sleep 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.550
 The point is to completely turn off the switch like completely turning off your feelings 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.790
 The fact that enter to do is I bed I think action by 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.970
 When I am in my result in it anymore 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.970
 I 'm afraid I can turn on five switches 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 I'm out before you 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.890
 It seems like 23 hours have passed since I noticed 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.430
 Tomorrow for the video I made 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:05.409
 Because I have to take a narration 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:09.010
 Make a script for this narration, call it together, and do something about it for the next show 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.739
 As planning is advanced, meeting of it 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.280
 What 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.480
 I'm sorry this trouble 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.690
 I'm do not want to become Ppoku say or narration and is good if Tsukaere comment 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.040
 That 's the axis 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.740
 I would like to go and teak 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.760
 I sound taken to after all 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.920
 When you are working 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.920
 Well, when I'm coming to work 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.020
 Just maa clearly in myself 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.790
 The mean waving too much 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:46.710
 I have never felt, but after all , even a princess without work 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:53.610
 A little thinking about work 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.330
 There was even a time when living with or considered or would I called Seriously 5 work pattern 1 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.010
 The 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.000
 very well 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.890
 On the contrary, when I came to the company while I was in a state where the sound continued for a long time 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.150
 that 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.909
 Where to take off 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.140
 When I'm on the move or when I'm eating some sort of work or something like that 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.150
 And 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.519
 In the sound 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:27.950
 Tempted to what Fu in the off taking what Fu well off 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:30.970
 It seems like a little marbled state of using sound or making sound 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.970
 There is a place though 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.890
 That's right is what Kaso this
