 three points advanced on the fourth 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.289
 the sco will therefore defend his position 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.390
 at ac acaccio 16th, which does not count 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.990
 that an advanced point on the zone of 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.840
 relegation 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.540
 the sco is deprived of suspended mangani 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.040
 eudeline ayari and codjia her pless 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.140
 codjia co top scorer of the championship 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.000
 before the start of this match a heavy 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.039
 loss for the stÃ©phane mill team 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.809
 the ac ajaccio on his side must play without 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.730
 babylonia goncalves pedretti and 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.800
 lesoimier and madrid injured 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.579
 the first opportunity is this shot 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.420
 franc for the sco with a deflected ball 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.239
 a first attempt a little shy 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.620
 here is a second one with the desire to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.960
 quickly take the advantage this 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.149
 recovery is very beautiful and the ball 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.659
 captured in two stages by the goalkeeper 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.190
 goal of ac ajaccio oumar sissoko still 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.229
 once a free kick at which 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.049
 head resumption and opening of the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.430
 score is for sacha clemency 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.840
 third goal of the season for clemency 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.340
 in the 28th minute 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.690
 angers leads 1 0 a logical leadership to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.800
 bulletin board there have been only two 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.670
 Angevin attempts 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.100
 in this first period here is a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 more with this very difficult shot 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 and it goes far from the Corsican goal frame 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.350
 angers is not threatened 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.700
 and still leads 1-0 at halftime a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 sco who only lost two games in 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.300
 home since the beginning of the season 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.170
 but who stays on three matches without 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.460
 victory it's going well but with a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.040
 goal of advanced 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.630
 it's too little to consider 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.190
 already a definite success 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.710
 ajaccio on his side won only one 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.360
 only of his last ten meetings and 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.910
 needs points to be sure of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.140
 stay in league 2 the Corsicans who tries 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.220
 first of the second period of a 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.230
 different way but it's difficult 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.550
 against a very determined team of angers 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.790
 who wants to score the second goal 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.360
 new interesting strike and that's 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.250
 directly on oumar sissoko finally a 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.680
 attempt to ajaccio with this pass 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.650
 of Corsican captain johan cavalli a 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.910
 very nice opening and conclusion 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.370
 is not up to 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.860
 a rare opportunity for the team 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 of olive pantaloni it is angers who has 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.550
 most opportunities one more 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.740
 here and again sissoko interposing 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.630
 there had been 1 goal all over the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.940
 two teams in the first leg the result 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.330
 would perfectly fit the scea seen 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.850
 the configuration of the encounter this 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.610
 shy knock will not save ajaccio not 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.590
 more than this last attempt 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.330
 a much more interesting typing than 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.200
 previous ones but butude ludovic 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.200
 interposes 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.670
 angers who resist to the end despite 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.160
 this last confusion and the balloon 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.580
 who will miss the angels have had 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.019
 hot in the very last minutes 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.570
 but win well this match 1 0 and 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.570
 keep their place on the podium
