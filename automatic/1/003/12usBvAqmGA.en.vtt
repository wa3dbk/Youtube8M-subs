00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.319
 mercury 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.319
 one of the strangest planets in our solar system 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.380
 its surface is asleep during the day with temperatures that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.839
 exceed 400 degrees centigrade 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.029
 it's enough 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.710
 to melt lead 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.839
 but at night 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.439
 a fried icy dog ​​on the planet 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.129
 the thermometer drops to less than 180 degrees 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.200
 in the polar regions 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.260
 listen to youtube are so low to even allow 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.720
 the formation of ice deposits inside the craters in the areas 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 perpetually in the shade 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.170
 but the most curious aspect of marco 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 is that on this planet earth 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 determined by the rotation around itself 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.050
 the long year 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.050
 determined by the revolution around the sun 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.260
 more precisely 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.140
 2 days 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 equals other years 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780
 exactly for this reason 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.980
 hey for the strongly fish-like orbit on mercury 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.170
 it is possible to watch an incredible ballet of the sun 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.750
 for example we will be able to see it arise 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 grow larger while rising in the sky 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.000
 suddenly retreat 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.880
 finally 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 resume his journey towards 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.920
 good
