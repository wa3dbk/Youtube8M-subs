00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
on my Nexus 5 on pretty much the lowest

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.160 
on my Nexus 5 on pretty much the lowest
settings<00:00:08.490> actually<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.450> let's<00:00:09.660> go<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
settings actually so let's go to the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.740 
settings actually so let's go to the
options<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.179> let's<00:00:12.179> go<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.570> game

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
options and let's go to the game

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.299 
options and let's go to the game
settings<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.070> frame

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
settings and as you can see the frame

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.180 
settings and as you can see the frame
limiter<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.730> off<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.020> now<00:00:16.230> when<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
limiter is off and now when we go to the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.599 
limiter is off and now when we go to the
display<00:00:17.640> setup<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.920> obviously<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
display setup you can obviously see that

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.140 
display setup you can obviously see that
I<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.480> set<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.020> graphics<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.609> pretty

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I have set the graphics to be on pretty

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.130 
I have set the graphics to be on pretty
much<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> lowest<00:00:25.369> options<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.640> possible<00:00:27.599> so

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
much the lowest options of possible so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.460 
much the lowest options of possible so
yeah<00:00:28.439> let's<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> game<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.470> let's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
yeah let's go back to the game and let's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.209 
yeah let's go back to the game and let's
play<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> little<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.649> performance

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
play a little to see how the performance

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.520 
play a little to see how the performance
is<00:00:36.800> obviously<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> FPS<00:00:38.760> meter<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
is obviously I have a FPS meter on the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.750 
is obviously I have a FPS meter on the
top<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> screen<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:43.610> check<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
top of the screen so we can all check it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.779 
top of the screen so we can all check it
so<00:00:45.120> let's<00:00:45.390> run<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.719> circles<00:00:49.430> how<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so let's run in circles how are the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.119 
so let's run in circles how are the
performance<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> pretty<00:00:52.320> stable<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:55.129> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
performance is pretty stable it's it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.479 
performance is pretty stable it's it
doesn't<00:00:57.120> drop<00:00:57.390> below<00:00:57.989> 30<00:00:58.559> frames<00:00:58.920> per<00:00:59.010> second

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
doesn't drop below 30 frames per second

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.889 
doesn't drop below 30 frames per second
and<00:00:59.750> yes<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.020> probably<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:02.539> GTA<00:01:03.539> san

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and yes you probably know GTA san

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.770 
and yes you probably know GTA san
andreas<00:01:03.930> has<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.280> frame<00:01:05.670> limiter<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:06.659> though

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
andreas has a frame limiter even though

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.440 
andreas has a frame limiter even though
I<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.200> turned<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> off<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.670> still<00:01:08.729> limits<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
I have turned it off it still limits the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.960 
I have turned it off it still limits the
frames<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:10.200> 30<00:01:11.070> frames<00:01:11.400> per<00:01:11.640> second<00:01:12.500> which<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
frames at 30 frames per second which is

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.210 
frames at 30 frames per second which is
pretty<00:01:14.970> bad<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.900> mean<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:17.360> still<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:19.220> why

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pretty bad I mean I still don't see why

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480 
pretty bad I mean I still don't see why
Rockstar<00:01:20.670> did<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.110> let's<00:01:22.409> hop<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
Rockstar did all right let's hop in the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:37.560 
Rockstar did all right let's hop in the
car<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.759> drive<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> little

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:57.910 

I<00:01:37.630> knew<00:01:37.960> it

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.300 

alright<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:58.820> yeah<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.840> graphics<00:02:00.049> are<00:02:00.310> very

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
alright so yeah the graphics are very

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.950 
alright so yeah the graphics are very
very<00:02:01.549> bad<00:02:02.710> but<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.280> performance<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:05.240> very

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
very bad but the performance is very

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.350 
very bad but the performance is very
great<00:02:06.740> it's<00:02:07.189> like<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:10.130> doesn't<00:02:10.310> drop<00:02:10.670> below<00:02:10.849> 30

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
great it's like it doesn't drop below 30

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.790 
great it's like it doesn't drop below 30
frames<00:02:11.690> per<00:02:11.780> second<00:02:12.260> which<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.590> pretty

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
frames per second which is pretty

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.150 
frames per second which is pretty
amazing<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:14.270> clearly<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.050> nexus<00:02:15.530> 5<00:02:15.800> can't

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
amazing so clearly the nexus 5 can't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.600 
amazing so clearly the nexus 5 can't
handle<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:18.020> they<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.770> turn<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
handle it and can they can turn on the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.510 
handle it and can they can turn on the
game<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:20.350> hi<00:02:21.350> Oh<00:02:21.650> graphic<00:02:22.280> settings

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.110 

for

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.180 

see<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.780> guess<00:02:39.080> there<00:02:39.290> was<00:02:39.409> top<00:02:39.620> video<00:02:39.980> right

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
see I guess there was top video right

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.880 
see I guess there was top video right
now<00:02:40.989> because<00:02:41.989> there's<00:02:42.170> nothing<00:02:42.319> interesting

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
now because there's nothing interesting

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.220 
now because there's nothing interesting
going<00:02:43.129> on<00:02:43.489> as<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:45.080> frames<00:02:45.409> a<00:02:46.299> pH<00:02:47.299> meter<00:02:47.330> just

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
going on as the frames a pH meter just

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.860 
going on as the frames a pH meter just
stays<00:02:48.799> at<00:02:49.040> 30<00:02:49.459> frames<00:02:49.670> per<00:02:49.819> second<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.750> yeah

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
stays at 30 frames per second so yeah

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.630 
stays at 30 frames per second so yeah
thank<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.349> watching<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.190> hope<00:02:52.220> you
