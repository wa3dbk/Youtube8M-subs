00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi all of a sudden my chain nostrils 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.830
 today I'm making you a video 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.230
 nail art 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.110
 so it's a ferric enarque since 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.400
 is brignon and pink it's super pretty and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.139
 it's done very quickly 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 I let you watch the cie 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 video small precision I had 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 completely forgot to tell you that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 I put a respect of pink polish 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 candy less wacky little rhÃ´ne 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.960
 super hot on the nail to start 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 with a very light color alias is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.040
 left then firstly on a sponge 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 to make up I applied it three 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.770
 different colors 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.149
 the colors that I applied you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 appear immediately after these 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.600
 supposed to give you this then there is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.660
 three different colors 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.180
 the brightest down the bright at 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.180
 medium it watered very dark in water 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.079
 then with the rule since you have 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 used to put the colors you 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.540
 go stamped on your holiday especially 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.820
 great attention to the colors vosges 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.979
 must be positioned so that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.240
 the lighter flower is down and the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.920
 color plus darker colors 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.070
 two nights at exactly like on 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.070
 the image 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.940
 that's it if you find that your gradient 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 is not so degraded you have added 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.590
 the darker color in water is 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.789
 stamped to succeed in having a gradient 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.789
 As you wish 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.880
 it's glitter time so I 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.500
 will apply pink glitter to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 end of my world that alan gross was the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.080
 more possible and I'm going to have a party 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.970
 dazzling ranks by putting 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.950
 the most of soft straw 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.360
 and the least possible glitter in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.360
 downstairs it's very simple 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.880
 to finish I will add my topo 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.650
 clear and frankly his final 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.270
 super good but here because it makes 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.950
 really online and the joysticks 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.660
 so here I honestly hope that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.569

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.959

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.280
 jovial times of a gradient and I 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.290
