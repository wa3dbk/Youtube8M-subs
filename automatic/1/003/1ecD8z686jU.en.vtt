00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 good is what happens nothing here flying 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.410
 a while and what are you talking about in a car 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.410
 not typical 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.360
 this car looks sad it does not look like 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.360
 ego that is mounted so badly 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.850
 fly not always always 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.170
 very interesting remember when 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.750
 leaks came out in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.750
 zombies game files in gt5 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.469
 a theory about it has a theory 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 because it counts taking time because 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.200
 see the zombies have to put them 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.250
 physical stores created arrest him have 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.410
 created for the net redemption network 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.329
 undead nightmare I think it's pronounced 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 this is true the network expansion of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.930
 redemption of zombies that is the physical ones 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.489
 they are equal room or red dead redemption 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.660
 the only one that has also been created by 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 rockstar that would remain to know that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.410
 created card 5 and in this game to exit 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.690
 to take out with a kind of expansion 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 with zombies and has the textures is that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.890
 as they say 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.079
 he is a normal gta character but he 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.799
 but zombie 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.790
 interesting the case of this and as I say 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.770
 I did a lot of time without finding 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.729
 the hidden files of the game we are going to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 explain what the archives know 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.640
 hidden that I always like to do the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.560
 discharges of this topic and they are basically 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.299
 Well, there are hackers that get 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.830
 inside the game so to speak and 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.149
 they get to see what rockstar has 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.679
 inside the archives but that still 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.179
 he has not published it to the public 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.970
 say it published to the public in attentive 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.530
 the phrase then there are things that the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 they have there but they do not have them published 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.979
 to the public then well in a while 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.770
 is to find the hidden files of the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 I play an acronym that could oil mp 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.530
 that this then refers to the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.700
 word zombie obviously and it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.850
 found different things and such 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.479
 so then he knows that we are in 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 October and October 31 halloween and 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.099
 Halloween 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.549
 obviously diversity date more key 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.020
 to put this that says I think the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.369
 key date is certainly what leaves 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.979
 halloween or that another date could 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.200
 have to put zombies is the series is 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.189
 that the next date is still in plan 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.929
 important to say it would be in 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.970
 Christmas and Christmas is in plan all of me 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.500
 I would prefer and super happy with a thousand birds 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.340
 as a clear mouth and if you think well 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 really does not do great skill 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 as a celebration of thanks that more 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700
 important in america 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.959
 I do not know how much I could put 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.720
 zombies at Christmas or in action 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.970
 thanks in no way 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.280
 rockstar say a developer that does not 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.269
 be always every time an important 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.730
 than North America and such for example 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.110
 they like to commemorate and as they did 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.790
 in the previous telex as on the day of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.010
 interesting Christmas that as the day of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.290
 valentine in the df which was the other 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.420
 uncle on the 4th of July of independence 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.530
 indeed it took a long time with the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.599
 delivery takes months cars by 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.849
 key then good then the next day 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.680
 important is the halloween is the 31 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.060
 October and basically this video 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.010
 we do to communicate to you that is to say that what 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 you know and please leave us the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.470
 comments your opinion on the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.110
 topic that you think you can take this day 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.329
 and so on and so forth I really do not know if 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.489
 you will know but I think if I do not remember badly or 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.319
 If I'm not sure what was happening to me, 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 subscribers late robberies ago a lot 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.640
 of time that if you here are going to put 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.200
 again what the rockets were going to be 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.950
 these holidays and so some other of the efe 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.060
 and they said that the people who bought the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.500
 rockets this if such in his time when 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.370
 they put it in the day of the day of the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.660
 independence 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.280
 because all those people who bought 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.180
 when they put it back they were going to 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.700
 give a pack of rockets grad and gypsies not 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.490
 I knew it but something sounds to me but not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.490
 I knew if it was said 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.740
 because he wants because he can obviously not 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.600
 we can wait once is super strong 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.190
 and lola veloz or me really what a 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.810
 little is removed but I think that a 13 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 a mini of the s like for example the day of 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.560
 the independence since there is of effect 8 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.000
 and 13 a little smaller in the last 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.770
 we could say it costs 8 since I 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.590
 they gave new vehicles and such then 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.700
 Well, really, it's not going to be a 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.230
 list without plan with many things but yes 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.060
 that they are going to put something in plan for 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.580
 ambientar jeta 5 during would be in plan 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.720
 in halloween tucupita flow power 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.860
 if you are a loose DLLC as you say 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.470
 they can put a couple of 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.300
 masks that are pumpkins or something 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.530
 well the pumpkins that do not cost them either 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.240
 much you already know that subtract always like 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.520
 put nonsense in the games in plan 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.560
 to acclimate on important days 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.760
 of the division of times because at 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.320
 they can better put the issue of 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.140
 zombies that like that already is would be the 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.730
 milk father and I maybe at home the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.739
 loua to the very long in some car 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.500
 specials in zombie plan or something like that or 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.580
 some special care 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.830
 it is clear that rockstar has to have 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.940
 something in my hands I go to rockstar has 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.120
 than having something fat in your hands 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.220
 so I do not know or maybe they put a 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.590
 mile of dlc or they can get it from 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.360
 October 31 or may it be to protect 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.490
 5 imitate the final bombing at the same time 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.910
 I do not know as much as a definitive mallet 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.860
 but that the issue of putting some 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.100
 some reference to halloween as 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.020
 some mask what crazy is the subject of the 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.400
 zombies to the best to a lesser extent 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.650
 it can be better too, maybe not me 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.510
 super important insurance exhibition 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.430
 you know how the face they continue to 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.480
 be always but if true now 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.070
 has been surrounded by a generation of 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.180
 consoles and I think rockstar with the 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.800
 piece of will got into this 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.050
 generation said not to be grateful 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.910
 so to speak and I lived between 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.350
 hands and maybe as goodbye to something 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.419
 when milk was given to us 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.250
 better is that it is so said and that 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.930
 you never know when you're going to 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.280
 be up to new confirm it but the 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.870
 theme of the zombies that is that they have 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.100
 had as your asked and what I 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.720
 I always say what's good what he said 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.450
 to arrest a while ago is that what the 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.980
 people want there to be in gta there 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.370
 people like that exactly what is going 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.240
 if people ask for x is the subject of 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.780
 zombies is one thing that maybe 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.000
 I would come 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.320
 imagine that people who do not so 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.360
 it is but I love zombies 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.700
 severe and always go to the zombies and 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.020
 they throw an uncle egg to people 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.280
 almost everyone is very cool 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:50.180
 agents zombies the zombie is something 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.610
 that the people all this that we are going to 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.980
 talk and good to put an informative for 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.450
 to warn of October the halloween and to see 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.010
 what the fuck are you doing? 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.660
 soon to see if any 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.120
 filtering something something from the archives of 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.830
 hidden from Thursday and discover that if I 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.690
 I want to be in a few days 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.690
 something in the game about why not 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.650
 catch the flight 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.850
 now what you have to do 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.570
 then nothing and everything nothing to see what 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.500
 pass the title October leaving your 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.430
 opinion for the comment that we 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.430
 interested in having 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.610
 goodbye not unionized
