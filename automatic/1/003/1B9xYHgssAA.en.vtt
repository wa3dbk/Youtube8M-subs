about<00:00:04.770> something<00:00:05.130> very<00:00:05.160> interesting<00:00:06.440> however

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
about something very interesting however

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.000 
about something very interesting however
this<00:00:07.529> discussion<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.250> very<00:00:08.940> theoretical

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
this discussion is very theoretical

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.350 
this discussion is very theoretical
concepts<00:00:11.010> I'm<00:00:11.160> still<00:00:11.370> working<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> want

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
concepts I'm still working on and I want

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.089 
concepts I'm still working on and I want

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
help in want your input a lot of people

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689 
help in want your input a lot of people
who<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.920> geometry<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
who can think about this geometry and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.620 
who can think about this geometry and
how<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.270> flow<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> then<00:00:20.359> how<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.420> can

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
how it can flow and then how we can

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
how it can flow and then how we can
reconstruct<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.500> using<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> concept<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
reconstruct it so using the concept to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.790 
reconstruct it so using the concept to
describe<00:00:24.210> about<00:00:24.930> before<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.619> more

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
describe about before but with more

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.540 
describe about before but with more
complex<00:00:26.310> piece<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> geometry<00:00:26.840> this<00:00:27.840> being<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
complex piece of geometry this being the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.519 
complex piece of geometry this being the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.270 
vector equilibrium otherwise none of the
cuboctahedron<00:00:32.149> now<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> share<00:00:34.410> a

one on the inside layer this was
originally<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:50.090> person<00:00:51.090> who<00:00:51.210> discovered

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
originally the person who discovered

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
originally the person who discovered
this<00:00:52.170> shape<00:00:52.410> first<00:00:52.649> Manning<00:00:53.430> Buckminster

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this shape first Manning Buckminster

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.319 
this shape first Manning Buckminster
Fuller<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.390> early<00:00:55.070> 1900s<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> he<00:00:57.030> called<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Fuller from early 1900s and he called it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.470 
Fuller from early 1900s and he called it
the<00:00:57.420> vector<00:00:57.780> E<00:00:57.899> coli<00:00:58.520> equilibrium<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.239> shape

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the vector E coli equilibrium the shape

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
the vector E coli equilibrium the shape
is<00:01:00.600> also<00:01:00.809> called<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.020> cuboctahedron<00:01:01.410> because

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
is also called the cuboctahedron because

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.260 
is also called the cuboctahedron because
it's<00:01:02.520> made<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> squares<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.129> triangles

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's made out of squares and triangles

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's made out of squares and triangles
now<00:01:06.270> has<00:01:06.540> 14<00:01:06.869> faces<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> outside<00:01:08.390> six

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
now has 14 faces on the outside six

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
now has 14 faces on the outside six
square<00:01:09.720> faces<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.590> eight<00:01:11.010> triangular<00:01:12.000> faces

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
square faces and eight triangular faces

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480 
square faces and eight triangular faces
so<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.290> basically<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:14.070> guy<00:01:14.189> put

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
so it's basically this little guy put

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
so it's basically this little guy put
together<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.540> triangular<00:01:16.049> faces

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
together which has a triangular faces

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.719 
together which has a triangular faces
and<00:01:16.920> six<00:01:17.250> square<00:01:17.520> faces<00:01:20.360> okay<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.729> another

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and six square faces okay so another

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.749 
and six square faces okay so another
interesting<00:01:24.270> thing<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:26.369> five

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
interesting thing about this is the five

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.899 
interesting thing about this is the five
platonic<00:01:26.939> solids<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> take<00:01:29.460> each<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
platonic solids you can take each of the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.730 
platonic solids you can take each of the
shapes<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.200> put<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> inside<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
shapes like this one and put it inside a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
shapes like this one and put it inside a
sphere<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.460> each<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> points<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.299> touch

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
sphere and each of the points will touch

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
sphere and each of the points will touch
this<00:01:33.720> sphere<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.560> five<00:01:35.070> platonic<00:01:35.250> solids<00:01:35.579> do

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this sphere all five platonic solids do

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
this sphere all five platonic solids do
they<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> only<00:01:36.630> five<00:01:37.200> shapes<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
they have the only five shapes with the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.719 
they have the only five shapes with the
same<00:01:38.729> faces<00:01:39.560> within<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> within<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
same faces within the within that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.780 
same faces within the within that
specific<00:01:41.970> shape<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:43.020> makes<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.790> same

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
specific shape that makes that up same

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819 
specific shape that makes that up same
with<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.149> guy<00:01:45.329> except<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.409> made<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.680> two

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
with this guy except it's made with two

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
with this guy except it's made with two
different<00:01:47.009> types<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.430> faces<00:01:47.850> what's<00:01:48.600> most

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
different types of faces what's most

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.980 
different types of faces what's most
interesting<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:51.479> 12<00:01:51.780> in

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
interesting about it is the 12 in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
interesting about it is the 12 in
relation<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.130> made<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> thing

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
relation to the one I made this thing

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.350 
relation to the one I made this thing
completely<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.340> toothpicks<00:01:56.340> 36<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.270> them

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
completely out of toothpicks 36 of them

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.969 
completely out of toothpicks 36 of them
24<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> outside<00:01:58.740> 12<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.030> inside<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
24 on the outside 12 on the inside and

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.429 
24 on the outside 12 on the inside and
if<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.070> made<00:02:02.219> something<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.820> Oh<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.899> perfect

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
if I made something like Oh a perfect

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.560 
if I made something like Oh a perfect
example<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.829> guy<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:05.939> relates<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.360> why

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
example this guy this all relates to why

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.270 
example this guy this all relates to why
I<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.110> center<00:02:07.469> point<00:02:07.649> inside<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I have a center point inside the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.820 
I have a center point inside the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
I had to cut shorter too

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
everything else and then how he

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.620 
everything else and then how he

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.759 
point outward in 12 perfect vectors okay
so<00:02:40.819> let's<00:02:41.480> talk<00:02:41.720> more<00:02:41.989> about<00:02:42.140> applying<00:02:42.620> this

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
so let's talk more about applying this

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.530 
so let's talk more about applying this
concept<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:44.260> vortex<00:02:45.260> theory<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> vectors

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
concept to vortex theory so the vectors

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.990 
concept to vortex theory so the vectors
now<00:02:48.319> what's<00:02:48.530> neat<00:02:48.709> about<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:49.370> vectors<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
now what's neat about the vectors on the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.050 
now what's neat about the vectors on the
outside<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.709> say<00:02:51.890> one<00:02:52.280> choose

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
outside of this is that say one choose

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.150 
outside of this is that say one choose
one<00:02:53.239> triangle<00:02:53.569> base<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.470> got<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> triangular

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
one triangle base it's got a triangular

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.210 
one triangle base it's got a triangular
flav<00:02:55.370> face<00:02:55.730> right<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.720> vector<00:02:57.220> I'm

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
flav face right here in the vector I'm

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.120 
flav face right here in the vector I'm
making<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.030> vector<00:02:59.360> going<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:02.950> would<00:03:03.950> have

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
making the vector going in a would have

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.210 
making the vector going in a would have
here<00:03:04.480> clockwise<00:03:05.480> fashion<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.040> going

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
here clockwise fashion so it's going

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.280 
here clockwise fashion so it's going
around<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.180> clockwise<00:03:08.450> fashion<00:03:08.660> maybe<00:03:09.170> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
around in a clockwise fashion maybe a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.150 
around in a clockwise fashion maybe a
little<00:03:09.760> I'm<00:03:10.760> right<00:03:11.030> here<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> had<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.569> little

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
little I'm right here so I had a little

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.830 
little I'm right here so I had a little
bitty<00:03:16.160> thing<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.610> show<00:03:16.790> what<00:03:17.209> direction<00:03:17.569> was

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
bitty thing to show what direction was

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.740 
bitty thing to show what direction was
going<00:03:18.139> in<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:18.859> one's<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.160> clockwise

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
going in but this one's going clockwise

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.990 
going in but this one's going clockwise
which<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:21.170> direction<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.000> each

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
which is in this direction and each

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.120 
which is in this direction and each
triangular<00:03:23.660> face<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.440> vectors<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.799> steps

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
triangular face the vectors of steps

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.300 
triangular face the vectors of steps
which<00:03:25.370> one's<00:03:25.549> going<00:03:25.819> in<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:27.310> clockwise

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
which one's going in a clockwise

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.360 
which one's going in a clockwise
rotation<00:03:29.109> so<00:03:30.109> base<00:03:30.769> if<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.010> took<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.250> little

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
rotation so base if I took a little

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.180 
rotation so base if I took a little
marker<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.910> Mark<00:03:32.540> each<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.769> triangular

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
marker and Mark each one of a triangular

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.840 
marker and Mark each one of a triangular
faces<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.329> goes<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:36.850> clockwise

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
faces so it goes in a clockwise

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.610 
faces so it goes in a clockwise
direction<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.690> would<00:03:38.750> make<00:03:38.930> each<00:03:39.139> square

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
direction that would make each square

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.650 
direction that would make each square
face<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.609> go<00:03:40.850> counterclockwise<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
face then go counterclockwise and the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.629 
face then go counterclockwise and the
vector<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.109> doing<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.470> same<00:03:45.620> up<00:03:45.920> there<00:03:45.950> there

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
vector is doing the same up there there

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.210 
vector is doing the same up there there
there<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.590> these<00:03:48.650> are<00:03:48.739> going<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.130> a

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
there there so these are going in a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.500 
there there so these are going in a
counterclockwise<00:03:49.819> direction<00:03:51.549> now<00:03:52.549> to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
counterclockwise direction now to

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.750 
counterclockwise direction now to

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.580 
long video has been going no and will
tell<00:06:39.440> me<00:06:39.530> nevermind<00:06:41.770> so<00:06:43.150> we<00:06:44.150> used<00:06:44.360> to<00:06:44.540> have<00:06:44.780> two

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
tell me nevermind so we used to have two

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.910 
tell me nevermind so we used to have two

different types of geometry one's

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.620 
different types of geometry one's
basically<00:06:48.920> focus<00:06:49.550> inwards<00:06:50.030> while<00:06:50.330> the<00:06:50.450> other

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.410 
basically focus inwards while the other
ones<00:06:50.810> focus<00:06:51.170> outwards<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:51.980> how<00:06:52.940> a<00:06:52.970> pyramid

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
ones focus outwards and how a pyramid

you<00:06:53.450> can<00:06:53.540> think<00:06:53.840> works<00:06:54.620> and<00:06:55.300> so<00:06:56.300> the

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
you can think works and so the

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.670 
you can think works and so the

out<00:07:09.110> of<00:07:09.200> rock<00:07:09.410> much<00:07:09.800> more<00:07:10.010> energy<00:07:10.430> and<00:07:10.610> so

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
out of rock much more energy and so

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.380 
out of rock much more energy and so
technically<00:07:12.800> with<00:07:13.430> energies<00:07:13.790> more<00:07:13.940> focused

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:01.640 
now stop this video right now and then

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.590 
now stop this video right now and then
we'll<00:08:01.790> start<00:08:02.000> part<00:08:02.240> two<00:08:02.390> all<00:08:02.930> right<00:08:03.050> thank<00:08:03.230> you
