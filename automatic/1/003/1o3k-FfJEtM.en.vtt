four<00:00:35.500> wires<00:00:35.770> total<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.540> have<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.900> blue<00:00:38.140> and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
four wires total you have the blue and

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.530 
four wires total you have the blue and
orange<00:00:38.559> stripe<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.540> have<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.720> solid<00:00:41.170> green<00:00:41.470> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
orange stripe you have a solid green and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.939 
orange stripe you have a solid green and
green<00:00:43.540> with<00:00:43.930> another<00:00:44.230> color<00:00:44.470> stripe<00:00:44.830> I

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
green with another color stripe I

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.160 
green with another color stripe I
believe<00:00:45.129> it's<00:00:45.309> black<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:45.910> then<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.809> black

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
believe it's black and then a black

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.830 
believe it's black and then a black
round<00:00:47.620> you'll<00:00:47.890> have<00:00:48.040> two<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.489> them<00:00:48.660> mine's<00:00:49.660> a

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
round you'll have two of them mine's a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.780 
round you'll have two of them mine's a
little<00:00:49.870> different<00:00:50.530> because<00:00:50.620> mine<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.280> an<00:00:51.400> E<00:00:51.640> X

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
little different because mine is an E X

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.450 
little different because mine is an E X
that's<00:00:52.059> been<00:00:52.239> converted<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.930> LED<00:00:53.290> lights<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:53.800> I

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
that's been converted to LED lights so I

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.060 
that's been converted to LED lights so I
had<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.910> add<00:00:55.059> this<00:00:55.360> extra<00:00:55.570> ground<00:00:55.930> wire<00:00:56.170> on<00:00:56.470> my

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
had to add this extra ground wire on my

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.009 
had to add this extra ground wire on my
application<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.910> used<00:00:58.089> red<00:00:58.420> because<00:00:58.720> that's

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
application I used red because that's

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.410 
application I used red because that's
just<00:00:59.350> happened<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.710> go<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.830> add<00:01:00.040> laying<00:01:00.309> around

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
just happened to go to add laying around

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.380 
just happened to go to add laying around
but<00:01:01.420> um<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:02.950> your<00:01:03.460> car<00:01:03.670> this<00:01:03.910> fire<00:01:04.210> right

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
but um so in your car this fire right

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.779 
but um so in your car this fire right
here<00:01:04.600> will<00:01:04.780> be<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.930> black<00:01:05.259> ground<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.550> said

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
here will be a black ground so I said

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:08.630 
here will be a black ground so I said
picking<00:01:07.060> one<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.390> grounds<00:01:07.810> there's<00:01:07.960> two

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
picking one of the grounds there's two

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.520 
picking one of the grounds there's two
so<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.729> cut<00:01:09.940> one<00:01:10.180> black<00:01:10.450> wire<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.320> rest

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
so you cut one black wire and the rest

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.760 
so you cut one black wire and the rest
alright<00:01:12.399> alright<00:01:13.149> here's<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.930> first<00:01:14.170> initial

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
alright alright here's the first initial

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.590 
alright alright here's the first initial
connections<00:01:15.250> now<00:01:16.030> if<00:01:16.149> you<00:01:16.240> look<00:01:16.390> at<00:01:16.509> the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
connections now if you look at the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.859 
connections now if you look at the
module<00:01:17.020> itself<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.820> notice<00:01:19.180> one<00:01:19.420> side<00:01:19.450> has

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
module itself you notice one side has

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.590 
module itself you notice one side has
four<00:01:20.140> wires<00:01:20.380> one<00:01:20.920> side<00:01:21.160> has<00:01:21.280> three<00:01:21.460> wires<00:01:21.759> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
four wires one side has three wires the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.540 
four wires one side has three wires the
four<00:01:22.840> wire<00:01:23.020> side<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.649> input<00:01:23.830> side<00:01:24.250> meaning

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
four wire side is the input side meaning

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.249 
four wire side is the input side meaning
that<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:25.030> going<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.240> go<00:01:25.420> before<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:26.050> light

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
that is going to go before the light

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.260 
that is going to go before the light
easy<00:01:27.070> way<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.399> remember<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.880> when<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.090> read

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
easy way to remember is when you read

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.620 
easy way to remember is when you read
the<00:01:28.360> modules<00:01:28.780> as<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.110> TX<00:01:29.860> led<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.520> e<00:01:30.550> side<00:01:31.270> is

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
the modules as the TX led the e side is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.030 
the modules as the TX led the e side is
the<00:01:32.259> input<00:01:32.410> it<00:01:32.920> has<00:01:33.100> four<00:01:33.369> waters<00:01:33.759> okay<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
the input it has four waters okay on

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.160 
the input it has four waters okay on
this<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:36.610> have<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:38.650> solid<00:01:39.009> red<00:01:39.369> wire<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
this you have one solid red wire and

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.630 
this you have one solid red wire and
then<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.650> have<00:01:41.799> three<00:01:42.070> wires<00:01:42.250> grouped

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
then you have three wires grouped

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.880 
then you have three wires grouped
together<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.420> solid<00:01:43.840> red<00:01:44.020> wire<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.650> brake

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
together the solid red wire is the brake

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.880 
together the solid red wire is the brake
wire<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:46.060> gets<00:01:46.329> connected<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.619> green

side with the three wires alright so now
we're<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.590> side<00:02:17.799> with<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.070> three<00:02:18.400> wires

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
we're on this side with the three wires

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.949 
we're on this side with the three wires
you<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.030> again

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
you have again

a black and a red paired together and a
red<00:02:22.269> by<00:02:22.450> itself<00:02:23.340> black<00:02:24.340> simply<00:02:24.730> goes<00:02:24.970> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
red by itself black simply goes to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.950 
red by itself black simply goes to
ground<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.950> your<00:02:27.220> black<00:02:27.430> wire

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
ground back to your black wire

arm the other solid red the solid red by

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.290 
arm the other solid red the solid red by
itself<00:02:38.050> I'm<00:02:38.290> sorry<00:02:38.590> goes<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> brake<00:02:40.090> wire

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
itself I'm sorry goes to the brake wire

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.400 
itself I'm sorry goes to the brake wire
again<00:02:41.790> which<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.150> green<00:02:43.510> now<00:02:44.200> we're

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
again which is the green now we're

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.960 
again which is the green now we're
working<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.800> vehicle<00:02:45.250> side<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.730> we're<00:02:45.880> on

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
working on the vehicle side so we're on

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.770 
working on the vehicle side so we're on
this<00:02:46.150> plug<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:49.090> other<00:02:49.240> red<00:02:49.540> wire

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
this plug now and the other red wire

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.810 
this plug now and the other red wire
goes<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.620> green<00:02:50.800> black<00:02:51.040> stripe<00:02:51.370> which<00:02:51.670> is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
goes to the green black stripe which is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.820 
goes to the green black stripe which is
your<00:02:51.940> parking<00:02:52.240> lights<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:53.410> little<00:02:53.440> turn

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
your parking lights and a little turn

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.980 
your parking lights and a little turn
signal<00:02:54.190> wire<00:02:54.370> which<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.390> blue<00:02:55.750> with<00:02:55.960> the

signal wire which is the blue with the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.020 
signal wire which is the blue with the
stripe<00:02:56.320> does<00:02:56.710> not<00:02:56.920> get<00:02:57.100> used<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.700> vehicle

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
stripe does not get used on the vehicle

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.060 
stripe does not get used on the vehicle
side<00:02:58.180> because<00:02:59.170> everything<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.710> getting<00:02:59.830> taken

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
side because everything is getting taken

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.880 
side because everything is getting taken
over<00:03:00.370> by<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.550> module<00:03:01.350> now<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.410> only<00:03:02.650> thing

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
over by the module now the only thing

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.130 
over by the module now the only thing
different<00:03:03.010> about<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.580> one<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.480> you're<00:03:04.960> going

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
to have to run two wires from the brake

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.840 
to have to run two wires from the brake
and<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:11.170> parking<00:03:11.500> light<00:03:11.650> connections<00:03:12.550> yeah<00:03:12.790> I

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850

acts is to turn someone instead of just
the<00:03:31.240> outer<00:03:31.390> lenses<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.830> again<00:03:33.100> because<00:03:33.430> mine's

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the outer lenses so again because mine's

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.810 
the outer lenses so again because mine's
a<00:03:33.820> little<00:03:33.850> different<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:35.370> can't<00:03:36.370> light<00:03:36.580> here

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
a little different you can't light here

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
a little different you can't light here
so<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.090> can<00:03:37.240> see

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.410 

all<00:03:43.319> right

again<00:03:45.420> you're<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.930> cut<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.890> green<00:03:47.190> wire

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
again you're going to cut the green wire

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.780 
again you're going to cut the green wire
with<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.709> black<00:03:49.739> stripe<00:03:50.010> which<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.670> your

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
with the black stripe which is your

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.910 
with the black stripe which is your
parking<00:03:51.090> line<00:03:51.440> then<00:03:52.440> you're<00:03:52.560> going<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.739> wire

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
parking line then you're going to wire

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.400 
parking line then you're going to wire
in<00:03:53.250> your<00:03:53.510> parking<00:03:54.510> light<00:03:54.630> wire<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.200> ran

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
in your parking light wire that you ran

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.229 
in your parking light wire that you ran
which<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.800> my<00:03:55.950> case<00:03:55.980> was<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> yellow<00:03:56.670> wire<00:03:56.880> ran

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
which in my case was a yellow wire ran

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.830 
which in my case was a yellow wire ran
from<00:03:57.480> them<00:03:57.690> from<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> bottom<00:03:59.220> unit<00:03:59.510> now<00:04:00.510> in

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
from them from the bottom unit now in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.600 
from them from the bottom unit now in
this<00:04:00.989> pin<00:04:01.290> right<00:04:01.319> here<00:04:01.530> where<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:01.950> have<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> white

wire on a factory SX there will be a

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.509 
wire on a factory SX there will be a
pink<00:04:07.050> wire<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.530> you're<00:04:07.920> going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.130> cut<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
converted I just ran a wire directly

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.969 
converted I just ran a wire directly
into<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.750> pin<00:04:18.930> because<00:04:19.109> my<00:04:19.320> pin<00:04:19.560> was<00:04:19.709> empty
