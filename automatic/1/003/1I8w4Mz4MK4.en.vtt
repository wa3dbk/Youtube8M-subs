00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.469
 the telephone operators have been disputing 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.420
 clients in this fight they use and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.820
 they abuse promotions more and more 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.250
 as free calls to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 lines of the same company and packages 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 gigantic text messaging 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.390
 in the midst of this bombardment of benefits 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.740
 It's quite possible that you've already stayed 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.820
 decision to choose a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 operator 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.019
 but who says you can not 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.149
 to enjoy all these perks 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.399
 the multilaser has launched its home styles 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.070
 which has as a differential the support for 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.239
 up to four chips now check what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.239
 we found this device 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 the great differential promised by the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.600
 styles is the possibility for you to use 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.100
 four chips at the same time in this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 the multilaser phone does not 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 disappointed the device revealed a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 enormous ease when it comes to inserting 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 Yes, but its dimensions are not 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 be large 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.270
 in addition the cellphone detects and configures 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.990
 the network of each of the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 chips 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.030
 even though he is from different operators 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.369
 Finally, multilaser found a way out 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 simple and functional to facilitate 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.390
 chip selection time for a connection 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 she added a call button to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.979
 each of the sim cards you only need 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.990
 enter a number and press the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 to the operator's chip that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.159
 intend to use 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.170
 is undeniable the similarity between the style 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 of some blackberry models 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 this is not necessarily a point 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.250
 negative actually found the visual 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.229
 this handsome device with highlight 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 to the silver edges of part 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.770
 that give the jet more air 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 elegant 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.299
 However, the material used for 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.140
 coating of its carcass should be 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.270
 best 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.189
 the plastic is used in making the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 its external structure is easily 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.040
 marked with the natural oiliness of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.500
 our skin 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.780
 so the appliance is always full of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.680
 fingerprints that take away some of the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.710
 your beauty 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.689
 style is not a reference when 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.740
 subject is design but it has its 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.500
 qualities 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.510
 although the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.350
 product has a thickness that allows it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.050
 be insured 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.180
 firmly without causing discomfort to the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.790
 dimensions of its structure promote a 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.590
 very pleasant interaction with all 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.720
 your buttons without you needing to 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.450
 stay stretching and forcing thumb 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.490
 when you use the phone with only one hand 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.220
 but what most caught our attention 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.040
 in this guede was his lightness 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.410
 weighing only 80 grams you do not tire 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.240
 to hold it and can even forget 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 what's in his pocket 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.980
 we had the cell phone go through a routine 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.330
 heavy duty work and your battery 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 scrap account 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.070
 over the course of an entire day we 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.460
 connected to wifi networks using 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.450
 two chips running games and practically 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.940
 playing music on your player 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.400
 sending some text messages and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.800
 making multiple calls at the end 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.360
 of this period the device had not 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.360
 consumed half of its battery 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.930
 style is not the best option for those who 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.600
 want to surf the internet, he does not 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.610
 supports 3g connections only 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.370
 edge and wireless network 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.080
 but this is not the worst we had great 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.810
 difficulties in establishing a 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.550
 connection because the device insists on 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.740
 to report that there was no memory 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.860
 sufficient for the task 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.030
 furthermore physical keyboards 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.860
 naturally do not provide a 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.650
 most practical and intuitive way of 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.660
 move the cursor by 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.760
 buttons that keep him from moving. 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.020
 few pixels at a time is nothing 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.060
 nice 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.460
 style buttons are pretty 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.800
 next fact that allied with the few 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.720
 elevation of their structures ends 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.450
 inducing you to type letters or 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.060
 wrong numbers with relative ease 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.160
 the keyboard also seemed very hard or 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.530
 the pressure required for the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.560
 one character confirmation is greater than 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.840
 that we were accustomed to experience 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.760
 with this phone was 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.290
 below desired 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 another thing that caused us strangeness 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.690
 was the lack of isolated volume buttons 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.760
 which are usually located 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.280
 on the sides of the guedes 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.260
 you can adjust the sound intensity 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.570
 played while listening to music 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.000
 radio station or play a game for 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.600
 the middle of the most 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.550
 - that are mixed with the qwert keyboard 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.900
 but this is certainly not the best 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.900
 way for this type of activity 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.390
 the style can be found on the internet 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.200
 in a price range ranging from 195 to 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.480
 360 reais 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.300
 but is it worth the buy it 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.680
 answer is simple if you are looking for a 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.230
 way of enjoying the benefits 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 offered by different operators 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.150
 to call your family and friends. 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.470
 co-workers to purchase this 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.169
 device is valid 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.419
 the fact that he does not have to open the 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.370
 remove the battery to change the whole chip 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.280
 time you make a call is already a 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.410
 great argument for this audience 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.620
 Do not expect to find in this 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.570
 device advanced features the system 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.270
 and the hardware employed are 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.300
 quite simple, simply providing 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.570
 basic tools like fm radio player 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.790
 mp3 calendar viewer calculator 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.700
 and some games including classics 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.850
 puzzle game snape looking for one 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.590
 gadget to judge and execute content 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.270
 with great performance take away 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.790
 photos or social networking 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.320
 must move away from this model of 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.180
 multilaser 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.220
