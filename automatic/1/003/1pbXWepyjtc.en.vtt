what<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.890> says<00:02:38.160> because<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.730> think<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.120> is

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
what it says because I think this is

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.000 
what it says because I think this is
very<00:02:39.299> important<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.110> would<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
very important so would you like to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.310 
very important so would you like to
import<00:02:41.459> draft<00:02:41.790> class<00:02:42.000> from<00:02:42.329> NCAA<00:02:42.840> football

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
import draft class from NCAA football

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.259 
import draft class from NCAA football
remember<00:02:43.829> that<00:02:44.010> importing<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:44.700> draft<00:02:45.030> class

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
remember that importing a draft class

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.490 
remember that importing a draft class
does<00:02:46.019> not<00:02:46.440> guarantee<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.370> same<00:02:48.200> ratings<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.440> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
does not guarantee the same ratings on a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.039 
does not guarantee the same ratings on a
consistent<00:02:50.430> basis<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.269> ratings<00:02:51.840> will

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
consistent basis and ratings will

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.190 
consistent basis and ratings will
fluctuate<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:53.400> ensure<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.540> variety<00:02:55.170> of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
fluctuate to ensure the variety of

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680 
fluctuate to ensure the variety of
scouting<00:02:55.590> classes<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.209> means<00:02:57.450> is

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
scouting classes so what this means is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.039 
scouting classes so what this means is
that<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:59.549> ratings<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.209> will<00:03:00.359> not<00:03:00.630> get<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
that the ratings you will not get the

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.210 
that the ratings you will not get the
ratings<00:03:01.500> from<00:03:02.310> NCAA<00:03:02.910> football<00:03:03.540> 14<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.680> two<00:03:05.010> men

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
ratings from NCAA football 14 in two men

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.789 
ratings from NCAA football 14 in two men
they<00:03:05.579> just<00:03:05.880> will<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.299> transfer<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.530> think

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
they just will not transfer and I think

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.500 
they just will not transfer and I think
it's<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.040> good<00:03:08.220> thing<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.489> some<00:03:09.090> people<00:03:09.390> may

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it's a good thing and some people may

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.319 
it's a good thing and some people may
