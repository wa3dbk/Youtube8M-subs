00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.110
 on Tuesday during the visit of Vladimir 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.880

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.670
 South Stream 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.440
 thus she actually claims to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.140
 second in importance after Russia 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.610
 role in this project is supposed to 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.890
 Gazprom will deliver in Austria to 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.780
 thirty two billion cubic meters of gas 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.730
 about the same amount per year 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.220
 will be left to all others 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 project participants together we will discuss 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.239
 this topic with an expert in touch with the studio 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.680
 by skype university professor in 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.959

 books sato-san thai austrian very 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.920
 highly dependent on Russian gas in 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.470
 2013, three quarters of Austria's imports 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.630
 made up gas from russia need to turn 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.640
 attention to the fact that this gas to austria 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.100
 comes almost exclusively 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.860
 through Ukraine and because of the conflict between 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.280
 Russia and Ukraine transit failure will be 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 threaten 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 energy security austria 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.780
 so there is a long time 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.060
 interest in the south stream to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.739
 was built second 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.930
 alternative gas pipeline to austria after all 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.150
 gas would flow through it 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.670
 Central European gas bij under 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.860
 vein can be exported to other 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.120
 Western European countries and this 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.200
 additional budget revenues in Austria 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.329
 the european union wants to actually lower 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.220
 dependence on russian gas austria 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.329
 can defend its different from others 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.950
 countries in terms of the European Commission in 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.230
 last week made it clear that 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.780
 South Stream implementation will depend 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.690
 whether Russia will make concessions in 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.850
 Ukrainian crisis this position is Austria 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.769
 I do not share on the course and considers 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.019
 correct that the project should completely 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.850
 comply with European law and 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.920
 first of all meet the requirements 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.200
 third energy package but 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.620
 Austria does not see the need to link 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.660
 this 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.579
 from the political situation in Ukraine 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.520
 can austria with others 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.200
 by states 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.300
 who participates in the southern project 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.880
 flow and this is in particular Bulgaria and 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.750
 hungary insist on its point of view in 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.870
 European Union 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.700
 The answer to this question is not yet 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.130
 Relations between the European Union and Russia 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.480
 much worse in the near future 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.610
 Austria in this situation will be able to imagine 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.180
 allow to vote for economic 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.280
 sanctions in Austria are very close 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.680
 economic and financial ties with 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.130
 Russia volume of foreign trade turnover 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.180
 amounts to more than 7 billion euros 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.950
 Austrian companies have invested in 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.260
 Russian economy is already over 8 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.240
 billion euro engineering in 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.910
 banking infrastructure development 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.610
 the sector that is Austria is very active on 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.540
 Russian market if it comes to sanctions 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.530
 c vs russia third stage i.e. 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.600
 targeted sanctions in the economy 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.630
 or trade then this will have for 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.910
 Austria's huge consequences in the European Union 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.160
 Austria is the country which 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.650
 strongly opposes such 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.050
 kind of sanctions against Russia thanks 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.790
 Mr. Van year I remind you that in touch 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.160
 with skype was a professor 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.070
 University in the assembly expert in Russia 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.050
 gerhard mann year decision joining 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.940
 Austria to the South Stream was taken in 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.370
 the day of the visit of Vladimir Putin to the vein 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.210
 authorities of the alpine republic 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.560
 guided above all not 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.200
 political and economic 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.820
 considerations however many Austrian 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.570
 media consider such priorities 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.570
 erroneous 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.620
 Austria is seeking the location of Putin 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.110
 so called your comment in the newspaper 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.360
 standard alexander fedorov mid she 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.580
 Considers that the agreement is signed and fault 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.550
 about the south stream once again confirms for 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.720
 Austrian economics is more important than politics 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.610
 journalist notes president 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.400
 austrey heinz phisher though touched topic 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.260
 human rights but things with their own names so 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.030
 and did not call so phisher 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.430
 becomes accomplice of Putin and his 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.290
 politicians and also shows that opinion 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.050
 other countries and with him don't care 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.390
 the author concludes in the newspaper ingrid couriers 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.940
 steiner gash and writes taking Putin 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.920
 the vein ceases to keep pace with and even 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.840
 weakens the position of Brussels in a relationship 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.570
 with Moscow according to the journalist 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.310
 South Stream agreements will at least provide 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.920
 long-term Russian gas supplies 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.590
 but also will increase the dependence of Austria track 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.390
 and the browser wonders at

 business as with china or india where too 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.160
 violated human rights but politics and 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.620
 businessmen must make clear 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.630
 your Russian partner you have assigned 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.610
