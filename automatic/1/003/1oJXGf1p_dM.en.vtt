free<00:02:32.959> really<00:02:33.959> good<00:02:34.500> candidates<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.250> I'm

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
free really good candidates there I'm

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.860 
free really good candidates there I'm
think<00:02:35.849> they're<00:02:35.939> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.299> well<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.719> get
