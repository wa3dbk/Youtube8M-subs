00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.400
 consider a mod called flans 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.250
 mod he adds machines to minecraft 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.049
 tanks and weapons 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.119
 this mod is on days version 72 but it is not 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.460
 today at 15 20 172 he is very cool 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.750
 This is the latest version of the mod at 172 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 let's not consider it so today 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 we will look at the weapons section but more 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.500
 degree and so before we start consider what 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.010
 we take them for boxes 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.820
 inventory and will not let it put here 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.840
 I think you already know or understand in general 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.010
 here we have here is such a thing 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:56.960
 second thing yes and so we can get away from here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 anything we need resources that is 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.789
 let's see what we want to take for 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.789
 beginnings 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.890
 where for example I want to take a bar after 15 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.390
 iron and 10 wood and so take 15 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 let's take so 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.430
 iron or arc further go see barney 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.690
 and click on it if you have 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:33.090
 inventory sufficient resources then all 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.440
 its three enough resources then he with 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.450
 crafting let's try again 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.910
 you can even this one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 so that you have what it would be 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.500
 system peculiar requirements 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.900
 let's throw them iron too 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.530
 so let's move on to the next one 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.720
 this mod on and it is on 1 7 2 version 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.060
 cool she pie let's go first 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.300
 take this this a little later about it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.890
 tell but still take 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:09.060
 let's say we take ak-47 there burns well and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:15.060
 bar let it stay and so are you ready 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.120
 10 in general, the weapon is volumetric that is 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.799
 see it cool to home so arranged 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.220
 exactly with the hand as if we are real 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:28.990
 We aim sniper at all awesome 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.820
 but the bar is why that's not all you Weapon 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.610
 so let's say we've got a g3 works 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.400
 so now let's 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.550
 the best of our weapons that we want i 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.550
 for example, I want to improve m14 and what else 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:03:00.590
 permissible flow that I don’t even know 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:03.530
 so and the best gun if possible and so 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.040
 here we have to take gun modification 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.860
 then was put him go in him and 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.190
 the middle of putting my weapon is m14 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.040
 etc. Now he's a 3d model but we can 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.640
 put a sight and silencer sight with us 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.010
 here are two of them and here we have a silencer 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.480

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.280

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.850
 also make a sight like this 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.840
 so let's make for a gun 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.720
 sight here and put a silencer 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.890
