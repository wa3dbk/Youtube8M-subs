00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
we use are the IR 6000 s and are

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.819 
we use are the IR 6000 s and are
improved<00:00:40.440> ir<00:00:41.120> 6500<00:00:42.530> systems<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.620> first

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
improved ir 6500 systems so in the first

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.630 
improved ir 6500 systems so in the first
set<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> videos<00:00:48.210> were<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.110> be

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
set of videos were going to be

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.830 
set of videos were going to be
specifically<00:00:52.370> using<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.760> machine<00:00:54.000> we're

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
specifically using this machine we're

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.139 
specifically using this machine we're
going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> show<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:56.309> height<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
going to show the height in which you

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
going to show the height in which you
work<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.710> light<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.399> accordance<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.090> your

board<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:04.489> do<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> distance<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.720> how<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> set

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
board we do the distance and how you set

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.990 
board we do the distance and how you set
up<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.330> system<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.049> preheater<00:01:10.619> plate<00:01:11.000> we

up your system on the preheater plate we

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.560 
up your system on the preheater plate we
do<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> temperatures<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.460> controls<00:01:14.570> we

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
do the temperatures and the controls we

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.270 
do the temperatures and the controls we
do<00:01:15.780> times<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.479> distances<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.950> also

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.060 

display<00:01:23.280> how<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> use<00:01:25.759> specific<00:01:26.759> processes<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
display how we use specific processes to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.149 
display how we use specific processes to
improve<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.579> actual<00:01:30.180> reflow<00:01:31.049> process<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
improve the actual reflow process and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
improve the actual reflow process and
then<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.750> second<00:01:34.170> videos<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:35.159> we'll<00:01:35.340> do

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
then in the second videos what we'll do

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
then in the second videos what we'll do
is<00:01:36.049> go<00:01:37.049> through<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.909> actual<00:01:38.909> ir<00:01:40.159> 6500<00:01:41.159> from

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is go through the actual ir 6500 from

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.660 
is go through the actual ir 6500 from
set<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.869> completion<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.950> reball<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
set up to completion of a reball and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.730 
set up to completion of a reball and
this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.439> set

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this one what we're going to do is set

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.819 
this one what we're going to do is set
up<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.990> completion<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:50.100> reflow<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.829> quite

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
up to completion of a reflow and quite

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.929 
up to completion of a reflow and quite
honestly<00:01:54.950> both<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> processes<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
honestly both the processes and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.760 
honestly both the processes and
temperatures<00:01:57.360> could<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.840> used<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.259> each<00:01:58.500> one

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
temperatures could be used for each one

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889 
temperatures could be used for each one
there's<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.880> bit<00:02:00.030> more<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.509> tricky

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
there's a little bit more of a tricky

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.109 
there's a little bit more of a tricky
control<00:02:01.380> setup<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.939> there

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
control setup on this one then there

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.600 
control setup on this one then there
will<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.399> we're<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
will be on this one so we're going to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.429 
will be on this one so we're going to
focus<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> begin<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.409> then

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
focus on this one to begin with and then

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.859 
focus on this one to begin with and then
move<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
move to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.990 
move to
ooh and<00:02:09.259> our<00:02:09.470> second<00:02:09.890> videos<00:02:10.220> will<00:02:10.489> move<00:02:10.700> to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
ooh and our second videos will move to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.170 
ooh and our second videos will move to
the<00:02:11.030> second<00:02:11.840> machine<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.000> rest

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the second machine so for the rest

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.580 
the second machine so for the rest
daytime<00:02:14.599> what<00:02:14.870> we're<00:02:14.989> going<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.170> do<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.379> focus

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
daytime what we're going to do is focus

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.699 
daytime what we're going to do is focus
and<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.819> develop<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:18.080> complete

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
and just develop a complete

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.399 
and just develop a complete
understanding<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.610> how<00:02:19.879> we<00:02:19.940> use<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.450> one<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
understanding of how we use this one and

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.180 
understanding of how we use this one and
then<00:02:22.129> move<00:02:22.400> from<00:02:22.610> there<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:25.040> actual

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
then move from there to the actual

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.190 
then move from there to the actual
reball<00:02:25.760> process<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:26.900> for

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
reball process so this is all for

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.799 
reball process so this is all for
reflows
