00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 only today to teach you how to solve 3 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.880
 for 31 for 6 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.349
 Yeah, it's a lot like the three by 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.719
 three by four 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.580
 in fact I use the same things the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 technical text by four to solve 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.859
 if you already know the text text 47 that is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.600
 as if it were she accessed his body 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.260
 when you know sir six is â€‹â€‹not one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.929
 Bit of a piece, love, they'll shuffle. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.730
 the staff will take you adriano and still do 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 that in the time 3 by 4 is the first 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.390
 thing that I'm going to do is these means here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.910
 out okay 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.290
 Then I'm part of the inside then to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 begin to do the means so that the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.050
 I make a first bottom layer 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.719
 first to make the central here or these 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 two because against these two I do the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.180
 two outermost 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.520
 It's all Sunday the day you do this. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.289
 part of four pieces is that it's fine then 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.329
 it may be that these two plants 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.129
 really does a low first 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.150
 poem that she must have done the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.619
 orange 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.070
 then my white benefit is in 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.580
 down there he is here I see him here and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 here you have to see a piece that is green and 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.600
 a red and green strip 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.549
 red 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 so look at this piece you have to come here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.850
 because it is unlike this 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 orange and green 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.840
 I obeyed here she had to be 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 Here's left of it heats up there 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.340
 and turn back 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.079
 She's coming forward. She's seriously orange. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 old red pedro now that has to 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.170
 see red and blue have a red 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 blue has that and it's from here anyway 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.000
 because it is unlike the first 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.180
 here she touched the ball back and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 red river and blue 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.220
 you just want a blue and orange one that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.670
 is here and already the opposite 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.890
 See this last pending and 934 does 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.810
 her pair over where she has to with 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.570
 her steps forward here from the other 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.320
 side is going on this side here the ffa is 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.320
 this one here 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:25.700
 the day of blue farm's right hotel here 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.470
 where she was trying yesterday to go to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.720
 right first and the red and blue 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.730
 she's here oh orange and blue the red 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.810
 and blue that 's right is back here 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.730
 also 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.700
 This has to come down then first turn. 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.970
 here on the right, she's back there with 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.330
 who was behind with blue behind 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 the red and blue that was right 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.280
 I already came here and it works from side to side. 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.840
 blue and the other 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.069
 was now will get two 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.160
 players too 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.900
 now buy there and back same in the three 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.360
 Portuguese for four of us all 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.489
 here is like when you finished it the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.430
 top layer sometimes already has two 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.329
 right here oh orange and green orange 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.860
 blue 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.510
 It's only these two that I have to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.120
 change places 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.670
 these two that the algorithm did is that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.049
 I used to do the two with the ceiling 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.670
 behind still and there what was it like to 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.980
 I'll have to replace this layer 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.430
 then all the dirt underneath that direct 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.799
 3 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:36.760
 let's get right ahead and 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:40.010
 do what you kick with three in front 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:47.959
 I go back down and to the right. 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:51.519
 both times down low and okay 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.530
 to hit right here the parts so as to 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.769
 beauty then everything is already right 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.139
 first missile now do the most 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.139
 outer orange 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.139
 I have my head here in orange 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.160
 green 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.329
 I know that it's just contrary to what 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.799
 I'll do it here 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.720
 the summer holidays I came here 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.970
 down 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.239
 the year but I'm drawing here has problem 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.970
 We 'll meet later and get these from here. 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.560
 it 's not so orange and green 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:33.920
 now a green and red here red 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.950
 This red is here and there. 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.010
 Dad just come out here, then orange 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.620
 and green white red red blue 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.490
 there is missing on it here blue and red 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.520
 blue and orange 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.440
 here maybe I was telling you that it 's not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.860
 avoid up there then this one 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.290
 and it 's the opposite so let's go 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.880
 I was right back there, I'm just going 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.940
 move if both of you 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.720
 the layer outside again and back is ok 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.190
 good 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.420
 and then I got everything right for red 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.270
 walked in a place here in the middle of the staff 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.820
 I am no more or less know that after the 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.620
 people get the top ten 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.430
 two who have already been blinded here 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.050
 the red orange lights switched from 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.350
 Then I want to exchange these 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:34.010
 two place with them down there behind 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:39.380
 and make the goal and right front starts at 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:42.140
 down front right bottom make 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.040
 new underneath front 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:50.750
 underneath it and there we can line up 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:56.030
 from the top of the low hour and there we go 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.979
 use it now if you are not all right 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.930
 you better put this one right look 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.490
 for example blue and red 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.400
 the other three I have to change 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.290
 place also does not have to come over here 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.900
 He has to come here and he has to 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.940
 I came here and here we are going to use a 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.760
 thing of three by three which is what 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.100
 This play has to come here neither that 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.130
 over here and that come here for example 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:25.040
 It was easy to get there around noon twice 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.840
 missed a half- time only change 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.180
 these three and it was here that she 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.700
 I already came here because I was with 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.580
 my mother she came here and the yellow already 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.750
 I just came here and I 'm only going to do the part. 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.490
 the middle one 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:43.400
 leads from no shot twice round from 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.500
 noon twice the cup and the line 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.740
 new also yesterday the lineage of the lineages 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.230
 while you're doing the rest is fine 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.490
 and see that white is right and everything 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.460
 right here orange 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.470
 sometimes when you do so that your 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.020
 Orange and green step here in front 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.600
 for example white underneath blank 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.370
 it's okay, cool 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.860
 This happens but then teaches 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.830
 that the street is because I now hill it but I 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.450
 Could you make it cool, shall I say? 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.190
 I stayed here so the blue red 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.640
 and she knows she had a team 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.980
 will do work because they do not move 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.700
 in these media even now that we go 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.780
 same 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:26.030
 Okay, so this part in again three 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.770
 by 3 by 4 is just like staying with 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.169
 dutra doing a little faster here 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.650
 I saw three by three by four 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.650
 beauty
