00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and at first this makes no sense but

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
and at first this makes no sense but
basically<00:01:00.300> they're<00:01:00.600> picking<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.079> sheeny

going mask for use later and basically

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.039 
going mask for use later and basically
as<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> place<00:01:05.729> where<00:01:06.270> Roach

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
as they get to the place where Roach

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.250 
as they get to the place where Roach
American<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> answers<00:01:09.170> everything<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
American get the answers everything is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
American get the answers everything is
being<00:01:10.439> explained<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.070> flashbacks<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
being explained with flashbacks which I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
being explained with flashbacks which I
thought<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> nice<00:01:12.600> touch<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
thought was a nice touch because it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
thought was a nice touch because it
stops<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> dialogue<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
stops like a lot of dialogue in the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
stops like a lot of dialogue in the
moment<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.380> feels<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.009> actually

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
moment so it feels like they're actually

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
moment so it feels like they're actually
going<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> quick<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.270> fast<00:01:18.509> pace

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
going it quick for a pretty fast pace

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.359 
going it quick for a pretty fast pace
and<00:01:18.990> actually<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:19.590> efficient<00:01:19.979> about<00:01:20.189> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and actually pretty efficient about this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.990 
and actually pretty efficient about this
so<00:01:21.180> after<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.860> get<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> mask<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.909> then

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so after that you get the mask and then

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
so after that you get the mask and then
they<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> college<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.439> actually

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
they go they go to college they actually

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
they go they go to college they actually
go<00:01:25.979> into<00:01:26.220> khana<00:01:26.549> ho<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
go into khana ho because I think this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.609 
go into khana ho because I think this
was<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> outskirts<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.500> like
