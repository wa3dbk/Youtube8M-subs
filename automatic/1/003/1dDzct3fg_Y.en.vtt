more fluid political process I think

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
powers why do you think is that both

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.349 
powers why do you think is that both
branches<00:03:17.799> have<00:03:18.519> their<00:03:18.700> constitutional

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
branches have their constitutional

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.869 
branches have their constitutional
powers<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.019> they<00:03:20.650> can<00:03:20.920> use<00:03:21.190> them<00:03:21.459> to

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
powers and they can use them to

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.839 
powers and they can use them to
cooperate<00:03:22.690> if<00:03:23.319> they<00:03:23.500> want<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.799> matter<00:03:24.459> but

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
cooperate if they want to matter but

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.569 
cooperate if they want to matter but
they<00:03:25.090> can<00:03:25.239> also<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.840> as<00:03:25.959> easily<00:03:26.230> use<00:03:27.220> them<00:03:27.430> to

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
they can also just as easily use them to

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.569 
they can also just as easily use them to
try<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.790> frustrate<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.420> stuff<00:03:28.659> each<00:03:28.870> other's

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
try to frustrate and stuff each other's

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.880 
try to frustrate and stuff each other's
policies<00:03:30.579> I<00:03:30.849> think<00:03:31.810> that's<00:03:32.049> really<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
policies I think that's really the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:41.280 
policies I think that's really the
lesson<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.340> some<00:03:33.909> of<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.090> historical

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.839 

I<00:03:41.379> have<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.829> say<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> feel<00:03:42.280> like<00:03:42.489> one<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.670> the

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
I have to say I feel like one of the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:53.880 
I have to say I feel like one of the
trees<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:51.010> seems<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.459> me<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:52.680> some<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.799> the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
trees so it seems to me that some of the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.039 
trees so it seems to me that some of the
evidence<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.849> Jack<00:03:55.239> was<00:03:55.420> talking<00:03:55.900> about<00:03:56.019> I

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
evidence that Jack was talking about I

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.440 
evidence that Jack was talking about I
have<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.439> do<00:03:56.590> with<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.159> you<00:03:57.219> had<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.790> think

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
have to do with that so you had I think

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.800 
have to do with that so you had I think
it's<00:03:58.720> very<00:03:58.780> samey<00:03:59.909> 17th<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:01.329> really<00:04:01.599> did<00:04:01.720> an

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
it's very samey 17th that really did an

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.410 
it's very samey 17th that really did an
18th<00:04:02.140> century<00:04:02.400> struggle<00:04:03.400> between<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.150> king

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
18th century struggle between the king

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.000 
18th century struggle between the king
and<00:04:04.569> parliament<00:04:04.780> over<00:04:05.230> control<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.769> war

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and parliament over control of the war

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.539 
and parliament over control of the war
and<00:04:06.280> was<00:04:07.239> true<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.599> Blackstone<00:04:08.370> provides<00:04:09.370> us

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549

a<00:04:09.579> very<00:04:09.819> formal<00:04:10.359> description<00:04:10.689> of<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.079> Kings

a very formal description of the Kings

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.410 
a very formal description of the Kings
powers<00:04:11.799> were<00:04:11.950> quite<00:04:12.250> broad<00:04:12.609> I<00:04:12.939> think<00:04:13.359> a

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
powers were quite broad I think a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.809 
powers were quite broad I think a
practice<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.230> think<00:04:14.829> it's<00:04:14.950> Jack<00:04:15.129> seven<00:04:15.549> shows

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
practice I think it's Jack seven shows

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.240 
practice I think it's Jack seven shows
there's<00:04:16.449> much<00:04:16.690> more<00:04:16.840> fluid<00:04:17.250> interaction

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
there's much more fluid interaction

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.069 
there's much more fluid interaction
