about<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> adjust

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
about this is that you do have to adjust

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
about this is that you do have to adjust
the<00:01:22.650> puller<00:01:22.950> ends<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
gives it that little bit more of a geeky

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
gives it that little bit more of a geeky
edge<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.479> don't<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.780> actually

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
edge to it don't you think actually

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.960

that's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.180> geeky<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.409> my

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that's a very geeky thing to do in my

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850 
that's a very geeky thing to do in my
opinion<00:01:35.930> alright<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.500> way<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
opinion alright so the way that this

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
opinion alright so the way that this
works<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.820> first<00:01:39.060> need<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> remove<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
works is you first need to remove the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.039 
works is you first need to remove the
battery<00:01:40.790> from<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:41.850> cell<00:01:42.210> phone<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.840> the

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
are inwards like this and yep got it

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.559 
are inwards like this and yep got it
just<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:32.379> here<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.829> test<00:02:33.159> light

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
just right this here is the test light

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.759 
just right this here is the test light
it's<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.959> make<00:02:35.079> sure<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.680> the

which<00:02:38.200> side<00:02:38.409> was<00:02:38.620> +<00:02:38.890> or<00:02:39.040> where<00:02:39.190> sight<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.549> -

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
which side was + or where sight was -

which side was + or where sight was -
this<00:02:40.420> one<00:02:40.629> would<00:02:40.780> let<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.109> know<00:02:41.700> once<00:02:42.700> it's

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
this one would let you know once it's

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:49.640 
this one would let you know once it's
charging<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.750> or<00:02:47.109> once<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.560> get<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.859> you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
charging you or once you get that you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.220 
charging you or once you get that you
take<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:52.180> edge<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.780> two<00:02:52.930> prongs

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
take out the back edge the two prongs

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.270 
take out the back edge the two prongs
that<00:02:53.500> should<00:02:53.650> be<00:02:53.739> plug<00:02:54.099> into<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.609> AC<00:02:55.450> outlet

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that should be plug into the AC outlet

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.020 
that should be plug into the AC outlet
and<00:02:58.560> then<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.920> green<00:03:00.159> language<00:03:00.579> show<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.879> would

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and then in green language show I would

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.879 
and then in green language show I would
show<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.269> guys<00:03:01.569> actually<00:03:02.230> what<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.709> looks

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
show you guys actually what it looks

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.949

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
like but I don't have an extension cord

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.030 
like but I don't have an extension cord
in<00:03:05.109> here<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.620> autofocus<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:08.040> totally

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
in here and autofocus is totally

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.949 
in here and autofocus is totally
unfocused<00:03:10.650> much<00:03:11.650> better<00:03:12.389> but<00:03:13.389> yeah<00:03:13.659> I<00:03:13.690> don't

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
unfocused much better but yeah I don't

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
have an extension cord in here so I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.000 
have an extension cord in here so I
can't<00:03:16.299> really<00:03:16.389> show<00:03:16.629> you<00:03:16.659> exactly<00:03:17.379> what<00:03:17.769> a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
can't really show you exactly what a

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.640 
can't really show you exactly what a
green<00:03:18.459> LED<00:03:18.699> looks<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.359> when<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:20.410> finished

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
green LED looks like when it's finished

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.860 
green LED looks like when it's finished
charging<00:03:21.099> or<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.489> blinking<00:03:22.060> LED<00:03:22.419> looks<00:03:22.660> like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
charging or a blinking LED looks like

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.849 
charging or a blinking LED looks like
when<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.709> charging<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:25.560> needless<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.799> say

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
when it is charging but needless to say

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.599 
when it is charging but needless to say
that<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.730> would<00:03:27.970> do<00:03:28.150> those<00:03:28.329> two<00:03:28.569> things<00:03:29.609> no

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
that it would do those two things no

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.569 
that it would do those two things no
like<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.849> said<00:03:30.910> before<00:03:31.180> we<00:03:31.480> do<00:03:31.660> have<00:03:32.340> one<00:03:33.340> that

like I said before we do have one that

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.150 
like I said before we do have one that
you<00:03:33.730> don't<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.629> adjust<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.470> polarity<00:03:35.980> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
you don't have to adjust the polarity to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.770 
you don't have to adjust the polarity to
and<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.669> know<00:03:36.760> figure<00:03:37.090> out<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.480> take<00:03:37.660> her
