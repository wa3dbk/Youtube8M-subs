00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone welcome to my new 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 tutorial this time it plays a bit the theme 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.360
 of valentine you already know by dates 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.660
 so I wanted to make a very simple look 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.670
 I hope you like it so let's start 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.109
 Start with the proofreader 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.000
 great sleepless nights 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.000
 imperfections in the skin 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.890
 followed by its powder base in my case 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.849
 preferably to leave a tone of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 more even skin 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.540
 and now this look complicated the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.520
 shadows and is that it can be said well here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 above I draw you a diagram so that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.570
 more or less understand me how I position myself 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.890
 the shades since it's a bit complicated 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.890
 for me to explain it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.039
 Y 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.110
 ah 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.110
 no no no 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.980
 and we continue with a white delineator 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.080
 pencil let's delineate our eyelid 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.080
 lower together with our lacrimal 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.800
 and now we return with the same shadows 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.200
 that we use for our eyelids 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.980
 this time to delineate us below 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.980
 our eyelashes 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.530
 and also to give a little shine to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530
 our tear 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.929
 and we continue with the blog first this me 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.299
 contoured a little the face still not 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.030
 perfection to this technique but practice 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.130
 you do not do the master they followed a bit of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.130
 blues or blush on our cheekbones 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.580
 and to finish a bit of illuminator 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.770
 now it's turn of line 2 this time 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.930
 I opted for a less extended delineation already 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.040
 that for this look we look for something more 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.040
 romantic and natural 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.749
 and finally a little of the issstep for 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.749
 that we think we have a name 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 and ready we finished 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.020
 If you have any questions or comments 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.210
 put it down here in the box 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.530
 comments and in the description of 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.220
 video there I will put my networks 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.690
 socials that are facebook twitter 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.230
 and also not only their life lay 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.040
 video if you liked it and then it's all 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.040
 we see the next 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.550
