the<00:00:21.240> way<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> works<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.230> right<00:00:22.529> under<00:00:22.710> that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the way this works is right under that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.250 
the way this works is right under that
button<00:00:23.130> there's<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.340> rod<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.539> rod<00:00:24.570> comes<00:00:24.990> down

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
button there's a rod the rod comes down

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.140 
button there's a rod the rod comes down
and<00:00:25.560> angles<00:00:25.890> back<00:00:26.160> towards<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> back<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and angles back towards the back of the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
door out just a little bit to create an

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.900 
door out just a little bit to create an
opening<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> tool<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:47.160> vehicle<00:00:47.670> calls

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
for the S tool or the vertical linkage

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.770 
for the S tool or the vertical linkage
tool<00:00:52.190> kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> glorified<00:00:53.760> slim-jim<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
tool kind of like a glorified slim-jim I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.799 
tool kind of like a glorified slim-jim I
guess<00:00:55.550> I've<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> rubber<00:00:57.000> tip<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
guess I've got a rubber tip on this in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.459 
guess I've got a rubber tip on this in
here<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:59.550> help<00:00:59.969> grab<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> rod<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.199> doesn't

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
here to help grab the rod so it doesn't

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
here to help grab the rod so it doesn't
just<00:01:02.120> sometimes<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> rod

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just sometimes when you get on the rod

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
just sometimes when you get on the rod
the<00:01:04.470> tool<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.890> wants<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> slide<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.640> down

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the tool just wants to slide up and down

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.480 
the tool just wants to slide up and down
the<00:01:05.909> rod<00:01:06.060> rather<00:01:06.540> than<00:01:06.780> grabbing<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.170> hold<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
the rod rather than grabbing a hold and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
the rod rather than grabbing a hold and
opening<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.080> rubber<00:01:10.229> tip

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
opening it so that little rubber tip

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.580 
opening it so that little rubber tip
helps<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> grab<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:12.119> grab<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> rod<00:01:12.689> so

hook<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.640> both<00:04:19.820> ends<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.829> was<00:04:22.370> gonna<00:04:22.460> start

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
hook on both ends so I was gonna start

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.130 
hook on both ends so I was gonna start
doing<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.940> few<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.150> these<00:04:23.240> lockout<00:04:23.690> videos<00:04:24.020> to
