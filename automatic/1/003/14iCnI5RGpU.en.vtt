out of this field that I thought I
really<00:02:45.310> covered<00:02:45.640> well<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.680> i<00:02:47.740> guess<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
really covered well so i guess that

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.300 
really covered well so i guess that
string<00:02:48.400> as<00:02:48.880> string<00:02:48.940> was<00:02:49.390> worth<00:02:49.600> picking<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.770> so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
string as string was worth picking up so

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
string as string was worth picking up so

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
degrees so we've had some beautiful

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.670

so<00:04:02.950> on<00:04:03.130> so<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:04.380> actually<00:04:05.380> cleaned<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:05.860> over

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
so on so I actually cleaned this over

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
so on so I actually cleaned this over
the<00:04:06.160> water<00:04:06.340> because<00:04:06.550> I<00:04:06.610> thought<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.849> was<00:04:06.970> going

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
the water because I thought it was going

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.309 
the water because I thought it was going
to<00:04:07.120> be<00:04:07.209> an<00:04:07.269> entity<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.599> that<00:04:07.750> one<00:04:07.900> was<00:04:08.050> fairly

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
to be an entity and that one was fairly

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.040 
to be an entity and that one was fairly
deep<00:04:08.760> 20<00:04:09.760> at<00:04:09.850> merck<00:04:10.060> was<00:04:10.269> only<00:04:10.480> about<00:04:10.690> four

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
deep 20 at merck was only about four

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.530 
deep 20 at merck was only about four
inches<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.280> was<00:04:12.519> probably<00:04:12.819> closer<00:04:13.420> to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
inches and this was probably closer to

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.349 
inches and this was probably closer to
six<00:04:13.870> inches<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:15.310> thought<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:16.000> might<00:04:16.030> be<00:04:16.269> an

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
six inches so I thought it might be an

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.360 
six inches so I thought it might be an
Indian<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.780> was<00:04:16.900> kind<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.229> lope<00:04:17.470> any<00:04:17.889> signal

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
Indian it was kind of a lope any signal

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.460 
Indian it was kind of a lope any signal
and<00:04:18.549> but<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.150> wasn't<00:04:19.450> it'll<00:04:19.660> eat<00:04:19.840> i'll<00:04:20.079> take<00:04:20.320> it

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
and but it wasn't it'll eat i'll take it

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.890 
and but it wasn't it'll eat i'll take it
and<00:04:20.560> i'll<00:04:20.799> be<00:04:20.829> back<00:04:21.419> Wow<00:04:23.550> hi<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:25.270> signal<00:04:25.750> was

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
and i'll be back Wow hi this signal was

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.730 
and i'll be back Wow hi this signal was
only<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.260> this<00:04:26.919> thing<00:04:27.100> was<00:04:27.250> showing<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:27.760> a

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
only a this thing was showing like a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.090 
only a this thing was showing like a
1241<00:04:29.850> 1242<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.260> was<00:04:32.380> only<00:04:32.500> about<00:04:32.680> four

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
1241 1242 and it was only about four

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.730 
1241 1242 and it was only about four
inches<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.820> thought<00:04:34.240> sure<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:35.560> was<00:04:35.710> just

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
inches and I thought sure that was just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.680 
inches and I thought sure that was just
going<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.100> be<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> fairly<00:04:36.550> deep<00:04:36.970> memorial<00:04:37.540> but

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
going to be a fairly deep memorial but
