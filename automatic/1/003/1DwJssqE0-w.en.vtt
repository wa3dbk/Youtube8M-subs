cave<00:00:39.300> thing<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> guess<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> cave

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
cave thing I guess is not a cave

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
cave thing I guess is not a cave
obviously<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.399> its<00:00:41.640> resemblance<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
obviously but its resemblance of one and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.389 
obviously but its resemblance of one and
that's<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> call<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that's what I'm going to call it in this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.330 
that's what I'm going to call it in this
video<00:00:45.059> um<00:00:45.390> also<00:00:46.230> starts<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> cool

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
video um also starts off with a cool
lava<00:00:47.760> fall<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.390> could<00:00:48.600> definitely<00:00:48.780> have

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
lava fall so you could definitely have

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.880 
lava fall so you could definitely have
some<00:00:49.170> fun<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
cave that goes off pretty far in the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
cave that goes off pretty far in the
different<00:01:04.199> areas<00:01:04.530> there's<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.040> section

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
different areas there's a little section

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
different areas there's a little section
down<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.720> isn't<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> cave<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.590> said

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
down here this isn't a cave like I said

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
down here this isn't a cave like I said
on<00:01:08.010> an<00:01:08.100> official<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.909> close<00:01:09.119> as

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
on an official one but it's close as

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.910 
on an official one but it's close as
you're<00:01:09.360> gonna<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.380> comes<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you're gonna get and it comes out as a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800 
you're gonna get and it comes out as a
tiny<00:01:11.400> gap<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> actually

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
tiny gap in here which is actually

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.399 
tiny gap in here which is actually
pretty<00:01:13.080> cool

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
pretty cool

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.750 
pretty cool
so<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> could<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.400> back

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so you could have like a little back

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
so you could have like a little back
entrance<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.750> pre-made<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
entrance pretty much pre-made and I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
entrance pretty much pre-made and I
can't<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.340> back<00:01:17.460> through<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> let's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
can't get back through here so let's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
can't get back through here so let's
just<00:01:19.049> break<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.530> again<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.300 
just break that again you know that
never<00:01:20.610> happens<00:01:21.060> alright<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.020> yeah<00:01:22.950> pretty

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
never happens alright so yeah pretty
