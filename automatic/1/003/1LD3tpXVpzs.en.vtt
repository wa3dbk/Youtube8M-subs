00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.029
 I am kiwi variables like fruit but 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.029
 lower 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.630
 mari carmen 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.630
 efe 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 a wheel by button for all we are going to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.590
 make us nails perfect nails there are the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.080
 that are no longer perfect in the air 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 to help Haiti but variable 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.970
 first we have to remove with cotton 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.129
 I know tone this painting that you already had what 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.269
 first thing you have to do is remove 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.160
 the nail polish you had on your nails 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.510
 horrible green paint to make you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 a writing egg first has to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 remove your previous polish and for that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.479
 you can use the power of luck and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.100
 you will need a little cotton if you do not 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.350
 I had them unpainted in the same way 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.200
 put a little acetone to remove the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 greasy and some elicited some cream that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.479
 you've used so that is defined 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.090
 better your lover but do not jump makes us 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 the brightness is going to be true you do not have to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.080
 apply a base gloss and so when you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 apply a painting of colored doors 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.460
 the nail you 're not going to be smeared the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.930
 nails are key because you can say 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.720
 a lot about you 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 which is arranged a detallito the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.320
 people tend to think well instead 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.320
 how they mess up they think because 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 to rescue some nails that are already 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.050
 they had peeled a little because in the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.100
 gym usually happens that I peel 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.479
 nail 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 then I asked Mari Carmen 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.670
 she is an expert to see how she could save 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.070
 this nail if what makes you stand 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.470
 again the brightness of the color and then a 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.780
 of them with transparent brightness placed 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 painting in this way and I extend 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 towards the point 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.350
 in this way I rescue my nails and they look 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350
 fabulous 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.440
 then forget the shape of your nails with 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.080
 a lime and a cut movies and hail 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.130
 for the nails and trim cuticles for 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.130
 its surroundings 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.570
 also rounded 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.000
 and even pointy I like mango from 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.950
 ambiguities square at the time of 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.950
 paint you have to start with a base 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.569
 good but you have to do but you have 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.170
 that doing it for is good and so doing 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.579
 from here now the glazes and that you 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.680
 you can have a lot of fun and there 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.579
 countless colors you can use 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.379
 what I did, you're going to want me to do 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.609
 we can do it with stickers or bugles 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.780
 I learned a new one with sponges 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.639
 referring tics in government has the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.590
 fed me now not only 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.450
 colors but it can also do 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.280
 designs and for that we're going to help 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.879
 for these stickers I'm going to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:12.650
 place this sticker on your nails to 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:15.090
 make a super design to put it on 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.800
 we must make your designs we are going to 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.750

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:28.560

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.410

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:37.470

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.710
