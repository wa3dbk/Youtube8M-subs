 you are looking for a nice souvenir for baby 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.290
 shower then these beautiful 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.290
 little rides with sweets you'll love 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.830
 cardboard corrugated cardboard or foami 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.610
 pastel colors 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.990
 a recycled sheet 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.360
 [Music] 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.820
 compass or an object with which you can 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.490
 circle 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.820

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.320
 [Music] 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.320
 this 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.280
 crepe paper and chinese paper in colors 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.820
 cake and all the stuff you want to 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 decorate 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.670
 we take the recycled sheet and the compass or 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.220
 the round object we mark a circle in 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.110
 the sheet and we cut it the measure of 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.570
 circle you make will also be the size 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.430
 approximate of the stroller so you should 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.290
 calculate how big you need it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.320
 according to what you are going to put in now 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.160
 let's fold the circle in half 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.630
 and again we fold it in half 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.909
 [Music] 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.690
 if we unfold it, you will see that we were left 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.150
 four sections of the same size 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.190
 let's cut only one of these 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.430
 sections the one you want but only 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.430
 a 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.120
 this figure will be our template as well 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.430
 Do not lose it 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.130
 now let's take the corrugated cardboard 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.840
 and on the smooth side we mark two 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.900
 circles of the same measure as the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.030
 template and we cut them since we have 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.340
 the two little circles cut we're going to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.410
 take the template and line it up with 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.600
 one of the circles and we mark with the 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.720
 pencil the section that we cut now 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 let's also cut this section and 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.560
 we do the same with the other little circle 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.649
 very well until now we will have these 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.170
 two stick figures leave them for a moment 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.599
 and we take the template and the rule 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 we fold the template in half and 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.580
 we have the straight part that is to say the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.950
 diameter of our circle 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.440
 now let's take the recycled sheet and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 our little pencil we will take the measure 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.250
 of the circumference of our figure 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.080
 to know what size we should cut 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.080
 the strip that will shape our 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.650
 cart for that we're going to use the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.470
 next network let's multiply 3.14 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.210
 16 for the diameter measurement in my case 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.580
 are 10 centimeters and we do the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.709
 multiplication 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.709
 [Music] 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.780
 and the result is 31.41 centimeters 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.790
 now if you look at our figure no longer 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.620
 it's a complete circle so to the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.370
 diameter measurement we subtract two 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.209
 centimeters 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.030
 in my case it would be 10 minus 2 equals 8 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.519
 these 8 centimeters is what is missing 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.200
 this section therefore we will have to 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:13.389
 subtract the circumference these 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.879
 centimeters like that 31.41 minus 8 equals 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.370
 23.41 centimeters that is the measure that 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.530
 we need for our strip and power 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.019
 to form the carrerita I am going to round 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.150
 centimeters and will be 23.5 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.980
 centimeters if you're socializing in the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.629
 same measures that I no longer have to 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.280
 do all this procedure only 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.469
 you rely on the measures that I am 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.329
 giving in the description of this video you 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.280
 I leave a proportional table with the 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.750
 as your strip should have only 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.930
 you have to look for the diameter measurement 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.849
 of your figure the width of the strip depends 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.280
 how wide you need the stroller 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.699
 I'm going to make it 7 centimeters 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.420
 wide so I'm going to mark a strip of 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.650
 23.5 x 7 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.620
 and I'm going to cut it 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.989
 [Music] 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.090
 and so we have cropped our strip the 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.159
 we leave for a moment and mark the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.230
 cartage love handles you can use it 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.940
 corrugated cardboard option I'm going to 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.069
 use this was my target so that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.690
 highlight the tires and look prettier 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.819
 I'm going to open the compass at 2 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.590
 centimeters or you can use another circle 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.780
 smaller to mark it 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.230
 we're going to need four of these threads 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.230
 cut out 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.440
 and until now we will have two pieces 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.780
 of the carriage lists a strip of 23.5 per 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.120
 seven centimeters and four casters 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.640
 we take the two pieces of the stroller the 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.070
 strip and the silicon and we will give the form 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.260
 of the stroller we put silicone to the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.300
 pull and we're sticking around the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.450
 carrerita we do this with both 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.639
 pieces 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.639
 [Music] 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.340
 ok I know we have the shape of the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.500
 stroller we are going to paste the llantitas of 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.330
 this way try to paste them as much 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.580
 aligned as you can 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.620
 here I also cut four circles 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.479
 smaller pink I'm going to 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.620
 Paste in the center of the love handles for 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.689
 give them a more beautiful touch and highlight 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.689
 [Music] 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.120
 we have finished the carolina now 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.810
 just missing the final touch the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.150
 decor 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.190
 You can use ribbon to decorate 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.350
 around and crepe paper to give it a 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.570
 hair effect the important thing here is 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:31.579
 decorate to your liking 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:31.579
 [Music] 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.500
 and ready here I have finished this 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.110
 beautiful carrió list you can do many 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.420
 strips of china paper how are you from the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.850
 color you prefer we finally put 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.620
 the sweet chocolates chocolates that 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.840
 you want to give at your party or baby 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.410
 shower and it will look like this 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.940
 the truth this is a super super fix 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.100
 beautiful that I recommend from the center of 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.110
 table and well this is a little trick 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.260
 obviously for a girl but here I have 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.080
 this other option for children this is 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.419
 made of foami and also looks very very 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.030
 pretty this is smaller diameter 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.550
 of this cart is 8 centimeters and 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.889
 here I put these white strips and 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.570
 blue and then here you have these two 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.940
 options the truth is that this idea is 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.340
 overcome wench and I assure you that your 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.710

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.080
 our beautiful arrangements because what 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.630
 They can be used as they wore alajeró or 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.669
 simply as an ornament it is even a 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.889
 excellent idea to use it as a little box 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.540
 gift for baby shower can not be 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.880
 expose some wipes some 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.000
 medallita pin or some detail 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.520
 that you are going to give for the baby and good 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.889
 I hope that this idea has pleased you and 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.930
