not be real estate investors thus far we
found<00:00:33.970> that<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.270> demand<00:00:34.600> for<00:00:34.840> our<00:00:34.900> properties

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
found that the demand for our properties

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.700 
found that the demand for our properties
by<00:00:36.160> itself<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.910> sufficient<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.630> make<00:00:38.379> our

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.500 

I<00:01:55.080> think<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.440> very<00:01:55.680> important<00:01:56.160> in<00:01:56.670> any

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
I think it's very important in any

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.510 
I think it's very important in any
market<00:01:57.870> to<00:01:58.260> have<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.740> right<00:01:58.980> local

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
market to have the right local

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.390 
market to have the right local
representation<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:01.050> people<00:02:01.320> who<00:02:01.680> both

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
representation and have people who both

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.370 
representation and have people who both
understand<00:02:02.940> your<00:02:03.090> company<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.200> local

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
understand your company and the local

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.230 
understand your company and the local
market<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.340> era<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> expatriate

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
market I think the era of the expatriate

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.480 
market I think the era of the expatriate
leader<00:02:09.240> who<00:02:10.200> rotates<00:02:10.680> through<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.220> two<00:02:11.400> or

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
leader who rotates through for two or

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.960 
leader who rotates through for two or
three<00:02:11.580> years<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.960> long<00:02:13.860> past<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:15.320> having<00:02:16.320> that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
three years is long past and having that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.860 
three years is long past and having that
right<00:02:17.970> balance<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:20.030> global<00:02:21.030> consistency<00:02:21.780> and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
right balance of global consistency and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
right balance of global consistency and
local<00:02:22.290> relevance<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.160> understanding<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.880> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
local relevance and understanding is so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.130 
local relevance and understanding is so
important<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.720> whether<00:02:24.930> there's<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
important so whether there's a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170 
important so whether there's a
