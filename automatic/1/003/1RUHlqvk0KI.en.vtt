the camera up here I'll show you
something<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> areas<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
something one of the areas that was a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
something one of the areas that was a
problem<00:00:54.379> was<00:00:55.730> these<00:00:56.730> those<00:00:57.090> three<00:00:57.510> rollovers

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
problem was these those three rollovers

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.360 
problem was these those three rollovers
they<00:00:59.160> were<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.609> concave<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.800> ball<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.250> get

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
they were so concave the ball would get

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.200 
they were so concave the ball would get
up<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.710> would<00:01:04.830> sit<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:06.180> know

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
up here and when it would sit you know

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.030 
up here and when it would sit you know
in<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> rollovers<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> won't<00:01:07.830> happen

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
in the rollovers which it won't happen

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.870 
in the rollovers which it won't happen
won't<00:01:08.280> happen<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.869> see<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:10.380> no<00:01:10.880> there's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
won't happen now see there's no there's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280 
won't happen now see there's no there's
nothing<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> smooth

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
nothing there it's nice and smooth

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:28.520 
nothing there it's nice and smooth
moving<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:14.390> there<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.810> stick

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
moving out there just and then stick

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
moving out there just and then stick
with<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> center<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:35.420> it's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
with the center and you can see it's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.160 
with the center and you can see it's
nice<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.689> smooth

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
nice and smooth

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.800 
nice and smooth
the<00:01:38.560> balls<00:01:38.800> not<00:01:39.100> really<00:01:39.630> trajectories<00:01:40.630> not

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
the balls not really trajectories not

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.600 
the balls not really trajectories not
affected<00:01:41.230> by<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.410> inserts<00:01:42.100> anymore

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
affected by the inserts anymore

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.860 
affected by the inserts anymore
it<00:01:43.300> just<00:01:43.510> goes<00:01:43.710> goes<00:01:44.710> right<00:01:44.950> down<00:01:45.870> like

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
it just goes goes right down like

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.960 
it just goes goes right down like
they're<00:01:46.990> not<00:01:47.080> even<00:01:47.140> they're<00:01:47.940> pretty<00:01:48.940> cool

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
they're not even they're pretty cool

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.550 
they're not even they're pretty cool
before<00:01:51.970> sometimes<00:01:52.480> you<00:01:52.900> know<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> ball<00:01:53.350> would

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
before sometimes you know the ball would

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.870 
before sometimes you know the ball would
hit<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:53.980> these<00:01:54.130> things<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.520> do<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:54.850> a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
hit one of these things and do like a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
hit one of these things and do like a
turn<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.570> was<00:01:55.660> kind<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.900> cool<00:01:56.140> looking<00:01:56.700> but

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
turn it was kind of cool looking but

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.030 
turn it was kind of cool looking but
obviously<00:01:59.380> that's<00:01:59.590> not<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.740> way<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.010> game

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
obviously that's not the way the game

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.410 
obviously that's not the way the game
was<00:02:00.310> originally<00:02:00.400> meant<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.970> be<00:02:01.060> played<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.680> now

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
was originally meant to be played so now

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.440 
was originally meant to be played so now
it's<00:02:04.420> nice<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:04.720> smooth<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:06.310> just<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:06.700> in

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
it's nice and smooth it's just like in

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.640 
it's nice and smooth it's just like in
the<00:02:07.480> beginning<00:02:08.200> when<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.160> first<00:02:09.310> came<00:02:09.550> out

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
the beginning when it first came out

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.560 
the beginning when it first came out
there's<00:02:11.650> no<00:02:11.860> no<00:02:12.550> weirdness<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> ball

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
there's no no weirdness with the ball

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:26.750 
there's no no weirdness with the ball
over<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> that's<00:02:20.040> mission<00:02:21.040> accomplished

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.860 

so<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:30.790> over<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:31.000> few<00:02:31.060> other<00:02:31.330> things<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
so go over a few other things on the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.670 
so go over a few other things on the
game<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> touch<00:02:37.780> ups<00:02:38.020> came<00:02:38.260> out<00:02:38.440> pretty

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
game the touch ups came out pretty

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.250 
game the touch ups came out pretty
pretty<00:02:39.070> good<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.310> think<00:02:39.670> if<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:41.230> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
pretty good I think if we can do a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.060 
pretty good I think if we can do a
close-up<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.269> super

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
close-up you know it's not super

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.170 
close-up you know it's not super
high-end<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:47.340> what<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.489> inserts<00:02:48.910> out<00:02:49.090> I

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
high-end I just what the inserts out I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.360 
high-end I just what the inserts out I
went<00:02:49.660> around<00:02:49.750> them<00:02:50.170> with<00:02:50.500> some<00:02:50.769> black<00:02:51.010> paint

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
went around them with some black paint

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.420 
went around them with some black paint
and<00:02:52.830> even<00:02:53.830> though<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.070> not<00:02:54.160> perfect

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
and even though it's not perfect

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.220 
and even though it's not perfect
circle's<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.300> see<00:02:55.480> what<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.660> was<00:02:55.840> talking

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
circle's you can see what I was talking

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.770 
circle's you can see what I was talking
about<00:02:56.290> before<00:02:56.580> where<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:58.150> doesn't<00:02:58.390> look<00:02:58.600> too

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
about before where it doesn't look too

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.430 
about before where it doesn't look too

inserts<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.100> are<00:03:03.190> larger<00:03:03.700> you'll<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.360> what

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
inserts that are larger you'll see what

slight<00:03:19.450> little<00:03:19.720> wisp<00:03:20.310> around<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.489> edge<00:03:21.670> and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
slight little wisp around the edge and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.390 
slight little wisp around the edge and
that<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:23.350> insert<00:03:23.739> had<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> little<00:03:24.190> bit<00:03:24.310> of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
that that insert had a little bit of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.490 
that that insert had a little bit of
wear<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.750> still<00:03:25.930> came<00:03:26.140> out<00:03:26.260> nice

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
wear on it but it still came out nice

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.660 
wear on it but it still came out nice
and<00:03:26.530> smooth<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:29.070> we<00:03:30.070> can<00:03:30.220> look<00:03:30.310> elsewhere

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
and smooth and we can look elsewhere

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.340 
and smooth and we can look elsewhere
around<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:33.640> one<00:03:33.850> over<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.420> came<00:03:35.200> out

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
around this one over here came out

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.310 
around this one over here came out
really<00:03:35.530> nice<00:03:36.330> once<00:03:37.330> again<00:03:37.570> nice<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.049> smooth

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
really nice once again nice and smooth

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.110 
really nice once again nice and smooth
there's<00:03:39.040> still<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> few<00:03:39.640> little<00:03:39.760> touch-ups

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
there's still a few little touch-ups

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.110 
there's still a few little touch-ups
spots<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.860> let's<00:03:42.250> look<00:03:42.400> at<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.580> spot<00:03:42.850> that

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
spots if you let's look at the spot that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.330 
spots if you let's look at the spot that
was<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.600> only<00:03:43.840> major<00:03:44.230> wear<00:03:44.560> spot<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.160> have

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
was the only major wear spot that I have

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.540 
was the only major wear spot that I have
in<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.549> game<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.680> color<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.310> color

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
in the game and the color the color

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.980 
in the game and the color the color
match<00:03:48.760> wasn't<00:03:49.060> too<00:03:49.270> bad<00:03:49.450> there<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.870> right

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
match wasn't too bad there it is right

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.970 
match wasn't too bad there it is right
there<00:03:50.050> it's<00:03:50.440> in<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.620> shot

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
there it's in the shot

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.520 
there it's in the shot
but<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.420> can<00:03:52.569> see<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.900> little<00:03:53.170> spot<00:03:53.470> right

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
but you can see this little spot right

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.949 
but you can see this little spot right
here<00:03:54.129> is<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:56.470> was<00:03:56.620> completely<00:03:57.040> worn<00:03:57.400> down

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
here is that was completely worn down

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.649 
here is that was completely worn down
and<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.709> just<00:03:59.739> used<00:04:00.190> some<00:04:00.340> regular<00:04:01.299> kind<00:04:01.569> of

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
and I just used some regular kind of

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.580 
and I just used some regular kind of
craft<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.830> hobby<00:04:02.980> paint<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:04.230> found<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.349> blue

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
craft and hobby paint I found a blue

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.559 
craft and hobby paint I found a blue
that<00:04:05.830> was<00:04:05.950> closest<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.580> it<00:04:06.819> but<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.450> was<00:04:07.510> a

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
that was closest to it but it was a

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.000 
that was closest to it but it was a
little<00:04:07.720> bit<00:04:07.930> light<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.470> just<00:04:08.709> started

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
little bit light so I just started

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.190 
little bit light so I just started
mixing<00:04:09.250> black<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.360> until<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.750> could<00:04:10.989> match

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
mixing black to it until I could match

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.530 
mixing black to it until I could match
it<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:12.160> dried<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.849> looks<00:04:13.030> pretty<00:04:13.239> darn

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
it and it dried and it looks pretty darn

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.530 
it and it dried and it looks pretty darn
good<00:04:13.629> there's<00:04:14.049> there's<00:04:14.560> some<00:04:15.090> kind<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.150> dirt

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
good there's there's some kind of dirt

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.199 
good there's there's some kind of dirt
and<00:04:16.720> junk<00:04:17.350> around<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.709> edges<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:18.880> I

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
and junk around the edges of it so I

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.439 
and junk around the edges of it so I
still<00:04:20.049> probably<00:04:20.590> need<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.949> maybe<00:04:21.300> put<00:04:22.300> some

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
still probably need to maybe put some

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.740 
still probably need to maybe put some
clear<00:04:22.780> over<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.139> or<00:04:23.289> something<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:25.600> came

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
clear over it or something but it came

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.420 
clear over it or something but it came
out<00:04:25.900> pretty<00:04:26.110> good<00:04:26.289> I<00:04:26.350> think<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.860> actually

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
out pretty good I think you actually

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.520 
out pretty good I think you actually
have<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.699> to<00:04:28.630> know<00:04:28.750> what<00:04:29.260> you're<00:04:29.410> looking

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
have to to know what you're looking

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.100 
have to to know what you're looking
forward<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:29.979> even<00:04:30.070> notice<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.699> it<00:04:31.389> kind<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.780> it

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
forward to even notice it it kind of it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.560 
forward to even notice it it kind of it
kind<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.740> just<00:04:32.919> fades<00:04:33.669> into<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> into<00:04:34.449> the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
kind of just fades into the into the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.590 
kind of just fades into the into the
back<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.990> play<00:04:35.169> field<00:04:35.350> pretty<00:04:35.680> nicely<00:04:36.600> so

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
back of the play field pretty nicely so

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.020 
back of the play field pretty nicely so
there<00:04:38.199> we<00:04:38.350> have<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:39.070> only<00:04:39.340> inserts<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:39.910> I

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
there we have it the only inserts that I

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.370 
there we have it the only inserts that I
didn't<00:04:40.360> mess<00:04:40.510> with<00:04:40.600> were<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> ones<00:04:41.139> up<00:04:41.289> in

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
didn't mess with were the ones up in

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.040 
didn't mess with were the ones up in
here<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.010> they're<00:04:43.000> not<00:04:43.120> too<00:04:43.360> bad<00:04:43.570> but<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:43.930> can

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
here and they're not too bad but you can

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.590 
here and they're not too bad but you can
you<00:04:44.380> can<00:04:44.530> still<00:04:44.800> see<00:04:45.070> like<00:04:45.370> see<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.090> can<00:04:46.360> still

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
you can still see like see I can still

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.189 
you can still see like see I can still
set<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.960> ball<00:04:47.139> there<00:04:47.460> which<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.699> cannot<00:04:49.090> do<00:04:49.360> on

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
set the ball there which I cannot do on

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.339 
set the ball there which I cannot do on
any<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.100> ones<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:52.800> fixed<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:54.610> know

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
any of the ones that I fixed you know

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.469 
any of the ones that I fixed you know
but<00:04:56.400> there's<00:04:57.400> just<00:04:57.610> there<00:04:57.789> are<00:04:57.910> still<00:04:58.210> some

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
but there's just there are still some

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:10.689 
but there's just there are still some
minor<00:04:58.720> little<00:04:59.520> things

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.530 

so<00:05:11.699> there<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:11.970> have<00:05:12.000> it

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
so there you have it

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.480 
so there you have it
I<00:05:12.570> think<00:05:13.230> this<00:05:13.350> machine<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:13.889> pretty<00:05:14.070> pretty

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
I think this machine is pretty pretty

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.990 
I think this machine is pretty pretty
darn<00:05:14.699> close<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.120> being<00:05:15.330> wrapped<00:05:15.570> up<00:05:15.949> I<00:05:17.000> don't

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
darn close to being wrapped up I don't

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.100

think<00:05:23.340> one<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:23.790> best<00:05:24.180> looking<00:05:24.330> bad

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
think one of the best looking bad

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.670 
think one of the best looking bad
glasses<00:05:25.470> ever<00:05:26.310> as<00:05:26.910> far<00:05:26.970> as<00:05:27.180> art<00:05:27.479> but<00:05:27.750> also<00:05:27.870> this

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
glasses ever as far as art but also this

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.100 
glasses ever as far as art but also this
one's<00:05:28.949> in<00:05:29.100> really<00:05:29.430> really<00:05:29.910> amazing<00:05:30.540> condition

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
one's in really really amazing condition

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.740 
one's in really really amazing condition

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750

videos<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.260> just<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.530> general<00:05:34.560> gameplay<00:05:35.340> on

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
videos of just the general gameplay on

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.159 
videos of just the general gameplay on
this<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.180> think<00:05:36.449> I've<00:05:36.570> got<00:05:36.600> some

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
this and and I think I've got some

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.250 
this and and I think I've got some
videos<00:05:37.500> that<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:39.180> gameplay<00:05:39.660> with<00:05:40.080> my

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
videos that of the gameplay with my

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.980 
videos that of the gameplay with my
overhead<00:05:40.740> camera<00:05:41.310> before<00:05:41.850> I<00:05:42.120> did<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.600> insert

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
overhead camera before I did the insert

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.430 
overhead camera before I did the insert
so<00:05:43.290> if<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.530> search<00:05:43.740> on<00:05:44.010> my<00:05:44.930> youtube<00:05:45.930> channel

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
you can see how the gameplay was a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.830 
you can see how the gameplay was a
little<00:05:50.580> bit<00:05:50.700> different<00:05:51.090> before<00:05:51.210> we<00:05:51.510> did<00:05:51.690> these
