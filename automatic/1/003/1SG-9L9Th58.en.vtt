00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 Oo 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:14.280
 I will only discuss the eighth part decaf coffee. 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.940
 Decaffeinated coffee is literally a caffeine-free caffeine. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.510
 Because of the people who drank, the sound technology was developed . 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 The book was first developed by the collapse of a German chemist in 1819 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.510
 And 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.789
 Geureotdam from the man named Lot Dios times after evidence that a business 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.679
 Technology will be widely used 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:40.620
 Now I caffeine sulfur Act Now there are three major solvent extraction under 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:43.559
 There is a solvent extraction method and there is a second water water chopping method. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.210
 The third is supercritical extraction 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.140
 It's divided into three. 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.030
 Apply the beer. Then you put the solvent and you dissolve the pin . 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.980
 So greatly solvent used is a bath-mail application as a global forum benzene deck 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 Put these things into claws color Pen Atlanta Hey, I was required to dissolve 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.990
 I'm calling. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.950
 Now that would be a bad jjokkeum Wondering what about the point that there is still such a solvent 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.360
 I'm worried about the product, so the solvent is often a safety problem. 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.380
 Caffeine is from 1 97 to 99% 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.090
 Here is the second water extraction of water by as red meat Caffeine Fugue 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.979
 That's how I did it. 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.250
 If you've left the water, even if the solvent remains inde little water is left feeling Franc 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.840
 I do not have that brown feeling anyway, so safety is two times that much. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.979
 You do not doubt it. 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.330
 And I use it. I do not care what kind of monster the water is . 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.399
 So economically it would be a little less, so you pay for the glass directly 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:47.509
 It is safe and economical because it does not interfere with raw beans . 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.900
 You can do this. 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:55.369
 Let us state that c5 tr 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.750
 2. If the liquid that occurs to remove the caffeine in saliva that occurs early in Article 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.689
 It is the way 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.130
 It 's a lot of money on the top floor. 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.390
 Selective drive of caffeine, which often has problems with home remedies like solvent extraction 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.410
 Available 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 But you have to look at the money to equip it. 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.329
 Caffeine extraction is something that can get you up to 2% points year joteunge 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.739
 is 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:25.670
 4 Decaffeinated coffee has come to an end. 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:29.090
 As a student you can also control a little rewarded spatiality overall cadet and won what 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.430
 Let's take a look at that book again. 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.200
 Here it is called in earlier books did. What a big coffee cherry fruit p 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:43.459
 There was a lot of cholery to do the job to pull the shell and pulp. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.030
 What do we draw the machining process, so here I'll bring 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.550
 I call it pumping. 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.270
 Well , I think that's what I now survive Tucson . Give me a tree. Yes . 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.970
 What I'll also see what Bo would not it be immersed in the water sseup 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.200
 Yes, it is. 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.020
 M of the announcement must be retired even if the beans are finished like this 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.370
 The mucus is going to be a living fetus . 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:14.209
 Well, then why do not you just eat it right here in the castle? 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.290
 , I have a hard pods surrounding it that warmth will pay beotge 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.790
 I did it. 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.280
 Now I can finish he passed away coasters Hunt looks as you see here. 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.370
 It's hard . Now the field is a problem. 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.620
 So what are called color beotge Sting 8 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.630
 Now, when the touch monitor is removed, it is now being imported into Korea . 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.580
 It will be imported to our country. 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.470
 Now go back to the lock's life would sound very jakeunde saengeol also commit to fight 10 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.420
 What did that say? 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:48.950
 Silver Steam Earrings Silver Skins Silver Skins are kept in the factory 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.280
 Drawing is something very difficult for me. But that's what that guy is pulling chairs butter 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.299
 And then it also has a bad influence on the taste of spikes. 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.470
 It's paying. 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:02.060
 But if you stick it inside then it will peel off naturally if you roast it. 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:07.070
 If you hear it when you are in it, the silver skin is naturally separated now 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.880
 Now that we got that silver did was so skinny separation 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.440
 After roasting yoreotge Now, did that do to the pool and then the beans 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.829
 By the way. 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.820
 Was a way to break up when Ross and right in poly student transcripts 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.690
 There is a way 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.019
 What do you call it? Then it's called polishing. 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.640
 That's it. 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:30.380
 But it was a bit difficult Ripper bouncing What is the reason that hey draw 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.360
 It's not exactly what you are doing, but if you take it off, 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.080
 It's neat and pretty. 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.760
 So now we'll see that battle but look like and sprained stripped it 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.300
 I do not think I need to do that . 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.900
 The system will polish the funds that are eaten by peeling work 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.190
 What a hurry to be one of the world's high-tech pyramids in the Jamaica Blue Mountains world 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.690

 Polishing was done because the whole coffee process was re-done Ah 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:19.249
 I told you once.
