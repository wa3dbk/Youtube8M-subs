00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
and I decided to get these highlights I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.410 
and I decided to get these highlights I
got<00:00:27.710> copper<00:00:28.340> gold<00:00:28.610> I<00:00:28.910> think<00:00:29.120> that<00:00:29.240> was<00:00:29.390> the

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
got copper gold I think that was the

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.499 
got copper gold I think that was the
name<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:30.410> I<00:00:31.220> think<00:00:31.490> they<00:00:31.610> really<00:00:32.119> blend

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
name of it and I think they really blend

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.590 
name of it and I think they really blend
in<00:00:32.689> well<00:00:32.960> with<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.320> rest<00:00:33.649> of<00:00:33.829> my<00:00:34.039> hair<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:34.850> I

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
in well with the rest of my hair and I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.520 
in well with the rest of my hair and I
must<00:00:35.870> note<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.309> i<00:00:37.309> had<00:00:37.670> used<00:00:38.059> a<00:00:38.359> henna<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.199> the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
must note that i had used a henna in the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.709 
must note that i had used a henna in the
past<00:00:39.769> I've<00:00:39.980> used<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.280> two<00:00:40.429> times<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.059> that<00:00:41.480> has

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
past I've used it two times and that has

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.809 
past I've used it two times and that has
given<00:00:41.899> me<00:00:42.170> some<00:00:42.440> really<00:00:43.010> low<00:00:43.370> reddish

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:43.819 
given me some really low reddish

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:45.700 
given me some really low reddish
brownish<00:00:44.089> undertones<00:00:44.690> already<00:00:45.109> so<00:00:45.589> i<00:00:45.620> think

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
brownish undertones already so i think

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.219 
brownish undertones already so i think
that<00:00:45.980> helped<00:00:46.460> these<00:00:47.149> highlights<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.839> blend<00:00:48.109> in

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
that helped these highlights to blend in

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.559 
that helped these highlights to blend in
really<00:00:48.469> well<00:00:48.649> of<00:00:48.979> my<00:00:49.190> hair<00:00:49.519> it<00:00:49.999> may<00:00:50.179> be<00:00:50.239> hard<00:00:50.510> to

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
really well of my hair it may be hard to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.599 
really well of my hair it may be hard to
see<00:00:50.780> cuz<00:00:50.929> but<00:00:51.319> the<00:00:51.530> henna<00:00:51.679> doesn't<00:00:52.460> really

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
see cuz but the henna doesn't really

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.020 
see cuz but the henna doesn't really
show<00:00:52.999> up<00:00:53.350> unless<00:00:54.350> you're<00:00:54.979> in<00:00:55.159> the<00:00:55.190> sun<00:00:55.879> at
