typical power supply here this is the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.859 
typical power supply here this is the
power<00:01:37.380> cable<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> plugs<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> wall<00:01:38.869> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
power cable the plugs into the wall this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.560 
power cable the plugs into the wall this
will<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> power<00:01:41.100> cable<00:01:41.670> well<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.299> plugs

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
will be the power cable well this plugs

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.889 
will be the power cable well this plugs
into<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> wall<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.479> plug<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> the

if for some reason you need to do that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.699 
if for some reason you need to do that
now<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.659> see<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> lot<00:02:37.109> of<00:02:37.140> computers<00:02:37.590> don't

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
they've done it in previous laptops but

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.740 
they've done it in previous laptops but
supposed<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.319> be<00:04:01.409> pretty<00:04:01.590> cool<00:04:01.799> nonetheless

you've<00:04:03.750> got<00:04:03.959> USB<00:04:04.560> port<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.280> power<00:04:05.699> jack

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
you've got USB port the power jack

you've got USB port the power jack
headphone<00:04:06.810> jack<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.919> see<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> tiny<00:04:08.729> little

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
headphone jack you see a tiny little

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.009 
headphone jack you see a tiny little
microphone<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.449> you<00:04:09.540> probably<00:04:09.690> can't<00:04:09.959> see

in<00:04:10.199> the<00:04:10.290> video<00:04:10.500> there<00:04:10.739> we've<00:04:11.340> got<00:04:11.370> another<00:04:11.699> USB

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
in the video there we've got another USB

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.559 
in the video there we've got another USB

port and the display port there and that

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.449 
port and the display port there and that
is<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.079> very<00:04:16.260> simple<00:04:16.470> computer

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
is it it's a very simple computer

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.550 
is it it's a very simple computer
obviously<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.209> you're<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.229> going<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.440> see

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
obviously it's you're not going to see

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.050 
obviously it's you're not going to see
the<00:04:19.680> drives<00:04:19.949> here<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.340> you'd<00:04:20.430> see<00:04:20.579> another

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the drives here that you'd see another

laptops<00:04:21.630> that's<00:04:22.500> sort<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.830> whole<00:04:22.889> point

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
laptops that's sort of the whole point

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.050 
laptops that's sort of the whole point
here<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.669> actually<00:04:23.969> has<00:04:24.440> solid<00:04:25.440> state<00:04:25.860> memory

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
here it actually has solid state memory

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.570 
here it actually has solid state memory
instead<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.800> hard<00:04:28.800> drive<00:04:28.950> as<00:04:29.160> well<00:04:29.190> now

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
instead of a hard drive as well now

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.250 
instead of a hard drive as well now
that's<00:04:29.760> internal<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:30.360> we're<00:04:30.840> told<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.139> not

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
that's internal but we're told it's not

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.930 
that's internal but we're told it's not
an<00:04:31.410> SSD<00:04:31.919> drive<00:04:32.190> because<00:04:32.400> as<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.610> can<00:04:32.760> tell

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
an SSD drive because as you can tell

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.730 
an SSD drive because as you can tell
there's<00:04:33.300> no<00:04:33.389> way<00:04:33.510> they<00:04:33.660> could<00:04:33.780> fit<00:04:34.020> an<00:04:34.169> SSD

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
there's no way they could fit an SSD

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.010 
there's no way they could fit an SSD
drive<00:04:35.040> inside<00:04:36.000> here<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.330> mean<00:04:36.480> if<00:04:36.600> they<00:04:36.630> did

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
drive inside here I mean if they did

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.360 
drive inside here I mean if they did
they<00:04:37.620> wouldn't<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:37.950> room<00:04:38.070> for<00:04:38.220> much<00:04:38.340> else

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
they wouldn't have room for much else

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.690 
they wouldn't have room for much else
but<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.389> actually<00:04:39.540> memory<00:04:40.230> chips<00:04:40.700> built

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
but it's actually memory chips built

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.909 
but it's actually memory chips built
onto<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.090> board<00:04:42.300> much<00:04:42.630> like<00:04:42.870> an<00:04:43.020> iPad<00:04:43.440> or<00:04:43.500> an

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
onto the board much like an iPad or an

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.610 
onto the board much like an iPad or an
iPod<00:04:44.550> we<00:04:44.730> have<00:04:44.910> so<00:04:45.510> there<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.200> go<00:04:46.230> that's<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
iPod we have so there you go that's the

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.290 
iPod we have so there you go that's the
unboxing<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.400> new<00:04:47.430> macbook<00:04:48.150> air<00:04:48.330> 11-inch
