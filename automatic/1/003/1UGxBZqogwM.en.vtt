right<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
right now I don't really have the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.950 
right now I don't really have the
Earth's<00:00:34.590> record<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.460> used<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.090> guess<00:00:36.570> it's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
Earth's record as I used to I guess it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.520 
Earth's record as I used to I guess it's
due<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> fact<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.590> um<00:00:38.329> my<00:00:39.329> uh<00:00:39.410> how<00:00:40.410> I'm

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
due to the fact that um my uh how I'm

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.069 
due to the fact that um my uh how I'm
living<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
living right now it's it the way I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
living right now it's it the way I
record<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.680> turned<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.399> something

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
record it just turned into something

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
record it just turned into something
that<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.329> had<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.260> attempt

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that I actually had to you know attempt

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
that I actually had to you know attempt
to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.219> where<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> first<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.120> started<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
to do like where is first I started and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.229 
to do like where is first I started and
I<00:00:49.469> could<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.829> record<00:00:50.309> whenever<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.850> felt<00:00:51.120> like

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I could just record whenever I felt like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
I could just record whenever I felt like
it<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.710> point<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.250> have

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it and now it's to the point that I have

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
it and now it's to the point that I have
to<00:00:53.640> actually<00:00:53.820> find<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.360> selective<00:00:54.750> time<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.980> do

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to actually find a selective time to do

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
to actually find a selective time to do
so<00:00:56.399> meaning<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> only<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.930> record

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so meaning that I can only really record

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.430 
so meaning that I can only really record
now<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.609> house<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.059> pretty<00:01:01.020> freakin

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like I used to be able to record in the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.950 
like I used to be able to record in the
middle<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> day<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.960> become

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
middle of the day but now it's become

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.980 
middle of the day but now it's become
pretty<00:01:46.500> darn<00:01:47.040> impossible<00:01:47.759> um<00:01:47.909> trying<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> look

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
pretty darn impossible um trying to look

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.679 
pretty darn impossible um trying to look
up<00:01:49.110> ways<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> maybe<00:01:50.000> soundproof<00:01:51.000> my<00:01:51.210> room<00:01:51.450> or

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
up ways to maybe soundproof my room or

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.950 
up ways to maybe soundproof my room or
something<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.140> isolator<00:01:52.710> move<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.310> hopefully

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
something or isolator move out hopefully

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.580 
something or isolator move out hopefully
somewhere<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.110> future<00:01:55.380> hopefully

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
somewhere in the future hopefully

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.060 
somewhere in the future hopefully
sometime<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.520> soon<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.840> um<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.469> stands

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.240 
it's like I kind of lose my enthusiasm
just<00:03:07.350> because<00:03:07.620> I'm<00:03:07.739> getting<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.100> little

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
just because I'm getting a little

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.729 
just because I'm getting a little
pessimistic<00:03:08.640> view<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.620> recording<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
pessimistic view on recording and

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.770 
pessimistic view on recording and
what-have-you<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.519> if<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.239> seize<00:03:12.420> my<00:03:12.540> poor

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
what-have-you so if they seize my poor

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.540 
what-have-you so if they seize my poor
lighting<00:03:13.140> right<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.650> um<00:03:13.769> yeah<00:03:13.950> that's<00:03:14.190> I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
lighting right here but um yeah that's I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.400 
lighting right here but um yeah that's I
just<00:03:15.360> felt<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.690> video<00:03:15.930> had<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.140> made

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
just felt like this video had to be made

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.580 
just felt like this video had to be made
uh<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.040> said<00:03:17.250> before<00:03:17.400> hopefully<00:03:17.760> um

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
uh like I said before hopefully um

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.410 
uh like I said before hopefully um
things<00:03:19.590> will<00:03:19.890> come<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.970> better<00:03:21.180> for

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
things will come out for the better for

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.020 
things will come out for the better for
me<00:03:22.220> I'm<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.640> anywhere

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
me I'm not going anywhere

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.720 
me I'm not going anywhere
um<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:25.110> guess<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.620> could<00:03:25.829> probably<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.370> wish<00:03:26.640> I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
um I guess I could probably I wish I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.830 
um I guess I could probably I wish I
could<00:03:26.880> use<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.120> time<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.360> record<00:03:27.720> right<00:03:27.810> now

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
could use this time to record right now

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.380 
could use this time to record right now
but<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.140> just<00:03:28.640> don't<00:03:29.640> even<00:03:29.820> like<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.360> that

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
but I just don't even like have that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.300 
but I just don't even like have that
