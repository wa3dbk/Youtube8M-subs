can't have save States some roms like
this<00:02:12.370> allow<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.850> actually<00:02:13.150> save<00:02:13.420> right<00:02:13.720> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
this allow you to actually save right to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.110 
this allow you to actually save right to
the<00:02:13.989> ROM<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.500> does<00:02:14.709> work<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.190> save<00:02:15.459> as<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the ROM and it does work to save as you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.630 
the ROM and it does work to save as you
can<00:02:16.329> see<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> started<00:02:16.989> out<00:02:17.079> here<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:18.310> um<00:02:18.459> you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
can see I started out here but um you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.460 
can see I started out here but um you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
middle of a level save it you can't do

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.289 
middle of a level save it you can't do
that<00:02:24.400> yet<00:02:24.610> not<00:02:24.880> yet

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
that yet not yet

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.440 
that yet not yet
I<00:02:25.329> say<00:02:25.900> yet<00:02:26.140> being<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> key<00:02:26.650> word<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.549> it's<00:02:28.239> all

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
I say yet being the key word so it's all

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.789 
I say yet being the key word so it's all
coming<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.079> for<00:02:29.260> now<00:02:29.350> I'm<00:02:29.500> just<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.769> to

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
coming but for now I'm just going to

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.920 
coming but for now I'm just going to
show<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.070> level

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:54.770 

okay<00:02:33.930> I'm<00:02:34.080> at<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> checkpoint<00:02:34.560> there<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:53.780> miss

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
okay I'm at a checkpoint there I miss

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.780 
okay I'm at a checkpoint there I miss
Yoshi<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.560> don't<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.130> one<00:02:56.340> I'm<00:02:57.180> depressed

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.630 

okay<00:03:02.790> very<00:03:03.090> easy<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.950> prove<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.370> running

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
okay very easy and to prove it's running

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.670 
okay very easy and to prove it's running
on<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> PlayStation<00:03:09.390> 3<00:03:13.490> there<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.610> go

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
on the PlayStation 3 there you go

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.660 
on the PlayStation 3 there you go
doesn't<00:03:16.680> get<00:03:16.740> much<00:03:16.860> more<00:03:17.100> convincing<00:03:17.400> than

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
doesn't get much more convincing than

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.180 
doesn't get much more convincing than
that<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.850> don't<00:03:18.090> think<00:03:20.300> but<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.900> does<00:03:22.110> work

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
that I don't think but so it does work

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.800 
that I don't think but so it does work
knocking<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.460> sucks<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.540> want<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
knocking that sucks is if you want to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.710 
knocking that sucks is if you want to
switch<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.200> rom<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.830> have<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.190> quit<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:27.570> go

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
switch a rom you have to quit it and go

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.270 
switch a rom you have to quit it and go
back<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> cross<00:03:28.350> Twinkie<00:03:28.680> bar<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.100> then

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
back to the cross Twinkie bar and then

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.800 
back to the cross Twinkie bar and then
relaunch<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.820> emulator<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.600> feature

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
relaunch the emulator that's a feature

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.780 
relaunch the emulator that's a feature
that<00:03:30.900> kind<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.320> sucks<00:03:31.530> right<00:03:31.710> now<00:03:31.770> but<00:03:32.520> like<00:03:32.700> I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
that kind of sucks right now but like I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.220 
that kind of sucks right now but like I
said<00:03:32.850> that's<00:03:33.120> all<00:03:33.270> going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.600> implemented

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
said that's all going to be implemented

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.410 
said that's all going to be implemented
in<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.620> future<00:03:34.650> try<00:03:35.490> in<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.730> couple<00:03:36.030> days<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.390> a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
in the future try in a couple days to a

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.210 
in the future try in a couple days to a
week<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> month<00:03:37.320> I'd<00:03:37.710> say<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.070> will

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
week to a month I'd say this will

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.270 
week to a month I'd say this will
probably<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.790> running<00:03:38.940> perfectly<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.160> I'm

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
probably be running perfectly but so I'm

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.050 
probably be running perfectly but so I'm
going<00:03:41.460> to<00:03:41.520> do<00:03:41.610> another<00:03:41.820> demonstration

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
going to do another demonstration

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.670 
going to do another demonstration
proving<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.990> be<00:03:43.080> run<00:03:43.230> off<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.500> hard

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
proving that can be run off the hard

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.130 
proving that can be run off the hard
drive<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> here<00:03:45.390> here's<00:03:45.600> an<00:03:45.690> emulator<00:03:45.990> I'm

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
drive so here here's an emulator I'm

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:55.800 
drive so here here's an emulator I'm
gonna<00:03:46.260> cue<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.590> again

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.260 

okay<00:03:56.560> now<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.770> see<00:03:56.980> these<00:03:57.100> little<00:03:57.340> two<00:03:57.550> arrows

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
okay now you see these little two arrows

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.199 
okay now you see these little two arrows
here<00:03:58.540> we<00:03:59.290> go<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.709> hit<00:03:59.830> back<00:04:00.160> I'm<00:04:00.910> going<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.120> go

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
here we go and hit back I'm going to go

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.850 
here we go and hit back I'm going to go
to<00:04:01.270> dev<00:04:01.870> hard<00:04:02.740> drive<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:04.319> here<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.350> have<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> ROM

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
to dev hard drive and here I have a ROM

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.550 
to dev hard drive and here I have a ROM
I<00:04:06.100> copied<00:04:06.550> using<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.880> FTP<00:04:07.360> server<00:04:07.560> Google

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
I copied using the FTP server Google

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.059 
I copied using the FTP server Google
super<00:04:08.890> ghouls<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.280> ghosts<00:04:10.200> now<00:04:11.200> I'm<00:04:11.590> not<00:04:11.890> sure

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
super ghouls and ghosts now I'm not sure

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.850 
super ghouls and ghosts now I'm not sure
why<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.550> interesting

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
why this is interesting

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.840 
why this is interesting
there's<00:04:14.860> someone<00:04:15.160> put<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.400> little<00:04:15.670> cheat

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
there's someone put like a little cheat

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.750 
there's someone put like a little cheat
back<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.209> here<00:04:16.389> cool<00:04:16.620> anyway<00:04:17.620> um<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:18.730> a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
back in here cool anyway um this is a

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.550 
back in here cool anyway um this is a
game<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.299> has<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> prime<00:04:20.019> example<00:04:20.530> that

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
game that has is a prime example that

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.900 
game that has is a prime example that
the<00:04:20.859> audio<00:04:21.130> doesn't<00:04:21.340> work<00:04:21.549> all<00:04:21.730> that<00:04:21.850> well<00:04:23.910> if

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
the audio doesn't work all that well if

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.030 
the audio doesn't work all that well if
you<00:04:25.090> can<00:04:25.270> hear<00:04:25.419> that<00:04:25.540> it's<00:04:25.750> staticky<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:26.800> not

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
you can hear that it's staticky it's not

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.700 
you can hear that it's staticky it's not
good<00:04:27.310> at<00:04:27.430> all<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.870> could<00:04:29.140> just<00:04:29.260> be<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.440> ROM

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
good at all so it could just be the ROM

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.200 
good at all so it could just be the ROM
or<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.100> could<00:04:30.280> be<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.520> emulator<00:04:30.850> having<00:04:31.150> a

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
or it could be the emulator having a

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.670 
or it could be the emulator having a
trouble<00:04:31.570> with<00:04:31.690> having<00:04:31.930> problems<00:04:32.440> with<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
trouble with having problems with the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.010
