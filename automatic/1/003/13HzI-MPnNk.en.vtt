watch the video you know that I am in
love<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.480> way<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> texture<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.910> like

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
love with this way the texture is like

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.509 
love with this way the texture is like
african-american<00:01:01.230> hair<00:01:01.470> repond

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
african-american hair repond

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.630 
african-american hair repond
so<00:01:03.089> it's<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.809> synthetic<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.250> comes

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so it's a synthetic way but it comes

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.810 
so it's a synthetic way but it comes
across<00:01:05.940> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.510> realistic<00:01:06.870> I<00:01:07.580> love<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> way

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

already you know and you can add heat
sort<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.620> sense<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.010> 400<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> synthetic

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
sort of a sense of 400 on a synthetic

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
sort of a sense of 400 on a synthetic
wig<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.440> not<00:01:28.680> add<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:30.270> heat<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.690> 400<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
wig I would not add the heat to 400 I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.010 
wig I would not add the heat to 400 I
will<00:01:32.400> go<00:01:32.580> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> low<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.719> haven't

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
will go kind of low but I haven't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.880 
will go kind of low but I haven't
flattening<00:01:34.829> any<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> these<00:01:36.000> wigs<00:01:36.240> yet<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.890> I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
try a different color you know see how I
look<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.950> color<00:01:50.189> looks<00:01:50.280> pretty<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.909> I'm

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
look and the color looks pretty good I'm

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.709 
look and the color looks pretty good I'm
not<00:01:51.539> used<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:53.509> wearing<00:01:54.509> um<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.549> like

not used to wearing um you know like
two-tone<00:01:57.719> colors<00:01:58.109> I'm<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.649> used<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.789> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
two-tone colors I'm not used to it so I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429

of people do like it
but<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:04.109> it<00:02:04.200> looks<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.619> night

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
but I think it looks really good night

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.919 
but I think it looks really good night
it's<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.429> colors<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.240> color<00:02:06.450> blends

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
it's like the colors the color blends

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
it's like the colors the color blends
really<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.039> said<00:02:11.280> before<00:02:11.430> like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
really good it like I said before like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.320 
really good it like I said before like
this<00:02:12.180> weight<00:02:12.810> brush<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.590> very<00:02:13.650> well<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.520> you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this weight brush is very well and you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.760 
this weight brush is very well and you
don't<00:02:15.480> really<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:16.020> much<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.620> you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
don't really have to do much to it you

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.440 
don't really have to do much to it you
know<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.100> don't<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> go<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.000> only

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
know if I don't want to go the the only

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.850 
know if I don't want to go the the only
downfall<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.710> um<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.410> partings<00:02:22.410> face<00:02:22.620> is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
downfall is that um the partings face is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.400 
downfall is that um the partings face is
not<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> lot<00:02:23.450> but<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.660> really<00:02:25.050> not<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
not a lot but this is really not that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.880 
not a lot but this is really not that
