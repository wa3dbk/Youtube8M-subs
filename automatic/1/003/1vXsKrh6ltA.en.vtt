00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.620
 continuing with the advance of this 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:09.669
 interesting course we will enter the phase 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.589
 3 called network topology I leave 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.019
 with the engineer age muÃ±oz so that we 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:19.600
 keep sharing your knowledge of 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:22.020
 this topic thanks toni the topology of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.020
 the net 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.430
 the network topology is defined as the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.340
 chain of communication used by arrangement 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.390
 that can be physical or logical that 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.190
 form a network to communicate and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.040
 interconnect with each other on a medium 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.989
 of physical topology communication is 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.660
 refers to the current design of the medium of 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.390
 Network transmission logical topology 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.059
 it is defined to the logical trajectory of a 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.910
 signal on its way through the nodes of the network 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.040
 in some cases you can use the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.309
 word architecture in a sense 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.100
 relaxed to talk at once about the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.760
 physical layout of wiring and how 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.550
 the protocol considers such cabling 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.100
 next we will explain the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.560
 various types of topology 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.120
 ring bus topology and topology 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.920
 star 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.410
 ring topology the topology of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.490
 ring would be explained as each node 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.740
 station or hub as in the presentation 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.140
 the station is connected to the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.020
 next and the last one is connected to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.990
 the first one is like a ring every job 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.270
 has a receiver and a transmitter that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.970
 makes the repeater function by passing the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.180
 signal to the next hub in this kind of 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.370
 network communication is given by the passage of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.860
 a token that delivers and picks up packages 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.140
 of information in this way is avoided 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.900
 eventual loss of information from 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.729
 packages a disadvantage is that if some 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.460
 node of the network stop working 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.380
 all communication is lost ring 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 in the image it is appreciated that there are two 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.880
 rings which allows the data to be 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130
 send in both directions this 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.470
 configuration creates redundancy what 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.510
 means that if one of the rings 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.810
 fails the data can be transmitted by 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.850
 the other also do not get carried away by the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.590
 circular shape can be a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.750
 distribution of ring as in the image 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.240
 2 without looking like it but it fulfills 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.560
 definition of being connected to the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.560
 first to last 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 bus topology this topology where 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.970
 use a single communication channel 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.040
 called trunk duct bus or backbone 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 which connects to the different 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.599
 devices in this way all 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.209
 devices share a single trunk 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.099
 to communicate with each other in the image 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.129
 it is appreciated that there is only one channel where 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.680
 the hubs or devices are connected and 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.459
 see how the communication is established 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.989
 advantage is that it can grow easily 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.790
 Its main disadvantage is that 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.909
 to break the trunk would fall to all 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.909
 system 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:13.000
 when the cable between 1 and 2 the hub 5 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.000
 it would no longer work 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.730
 star topology in the topology of 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.560
 stars all the devices in this 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.620
 case hub are connected to a 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.990
 concentrator or main header from 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.480
 which redirects the data to the hub 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.160
 adequate main disadvantage is that the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.170
 main header there is a large 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.360
 concentration of cables 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.300
 I continue with my questions I cut the cable 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.680
 between the main header and the hub one 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.760
 the entire network would no longer work 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.930
 it just would not work in hub 1 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.420
 advantages and disadvantages toni me you could 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.680
 support with the summary 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.549
 Right 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.909
 by the ring low cost advantages for 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.209
 long distance advantage load more 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.629
 good channels high advantage 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.579
 Advantage of fiber advantage 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.579
 clustering remote cluster ning 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.530
 the typology star advantage quality of 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.930
 the highest signal low cost 4 serves as 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.030
 links from a medium distance can 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.540
 optimize dividing signals in the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.260
 inadequate header disadvantage for 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.380
 long installation routings 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:42.070
 high amount of fiber in the header 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.040
 for the bus typology long advantages 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.970
 distances point to point low charge of 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.660
 fiber disadvantage requires electronics 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.330
 back-to-back in the intermediate nodes and 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.470
 4 fibers middle node 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.199
 thanks everything below I leave you 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.729
 to continue in the next session with 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.729
 the transmission media chapter 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.530
 yes
