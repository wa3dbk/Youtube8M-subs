you throughout the whole game and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
you throughout the whole game and
customize<00:01:57.780> guns<00:01:58.049> will<00:01:58.259> broaden<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> range<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
customize guns will broaden the range of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
customize guns will broaden the range of
options<00:01:59.280> during<00:01:59.759> missions<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.600> stealthy

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
options during missions so stealthy

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920 
options during missions so stealthy
versus<00:02:01.409> loud<00:02:01.619> scope<00:02:02.100> etc<00:02:02.640> they've<00:02:03.600> moved<00:02:03.780> on

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
versus loud scope etc they've moved on

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
versus loud scope etc they've moved on
from<00:02:04.200> static<00:02:04.619> fights<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.040> free<00:02:05.250> focus<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.969> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
from static fights to free focus so you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
from static fights to free focus so you
can<00:02:06.210> quick<00:02:06.450> quickly<00:02:06.810> switch<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.560> focus<00:02:07.740> to

other enemies no longer needed to lock

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.600 
other enemies no longer needed to lock
onto<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> enemies<00:02:10.800> although<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.430> lock

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
onto the enemies although you can lock

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.430 
onto the enemies although you can lock
on<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> wish<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
on to if you wish to but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080 
on to if you wish to but
hits<00:02:13.590> are<00:02:13.830> much<00:02:13.950> more<00:02:14.160> satisfying<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:14.940> you'll

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
hits are much more satisfying so you'll

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.550 
hits are much more satisfying so you'll
know<00:02:15.300> when<00:02:15.540> you've<00:02:15.660> actually<00:02:15.810> hit<00:02:16.140> someone<00:02:16.380> or

melee<00:02:22.380> capabilities<00:02:23.270> expect<00:02:24.270> some<00:02:24.420> really

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
melee capabilities expect some really

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.820 
melee capabilities expect some really
cool<00:02:24.780> destruction<00:02:25.350> carnage<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.920> damage<00:02:27.830> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
cool destruction carnage and damage so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.250 
cool destruction carnage and damage so
as<00:02:29.100> I've<00:02:29.460> said<00:02:29.520> before<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.020> see<00:02:31.050> in

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
as I've said before and you can see in

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.720 
as I've said before and you can see in
the<00:02:31.350> gameplay<00:02:31.650> trailer<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> TGF<00:02:32.370> I've<00:02:32.490> had

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the gameplay trailer the TGF I've had

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.660 
the gameplay trailer the TGF I've had
quite<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.210> them<00:02:34.670> destructible

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
quite a bit of them destructible

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.950 
quite a bit of them destructible
environments<00:02:36.150> from<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.360> walls<00:02:36.540> breaking

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
environments from the walls breaking

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.270 
environments from the walls breaking
down<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.440> off<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.130> would<00:02:38.220> be

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
down just off like that so that would be

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.550 
down just off like that so that would be
pretty<00:02:38.430> cool<00:02:38.610> combat<00:02:39.540> AI<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:40.140> much<00:02:40.320> more

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
pretty cool combat AI are much more

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.810 
pretty cool combat AI are much more
advanced<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:41.040> more<00:02:41.280> knowledge<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
advanced with more knowledge of the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.820 
advanced with more knowledge of the
environment<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.900> they<00:02:43.020> know<00:02:43.200> what's<00:02:43.530> around

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
environment so they know what's around

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.520 
environment so they know what's around
them<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.160> where<00:02:44.520> they<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.670> take<00:02:44.910> cover<00:02:45.150> etc

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
them and where they can take cover etc

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.810 
them and where they can take cover etc
enemies<00:02:46.530> will<00:02:46.710> behave<00:02:46.950> differently<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.760> who

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
enemies will behave differently by who

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.970 
enemies will behave differently by who
they<00:02:48.150> are<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> SWAT<00:02:49.020> teams<00:02:49.260> after<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
they are so the SWAT teams after the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.680 
they are so the SWAT teams after the
police<00:02:50.220> are<00:02:50.430> organized<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.180> gang<00:02:51.660> members

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
police are organized and gang members

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.820 
police are organized and gang members
are<00:02:52.170> more<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.770> gung-ho<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:54.830> do

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
are more like gung-ho kind of like do

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.170 
are more like gung-ho kind of like do
whatever<00:02:56.010> they<00:02:56.190> want<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.490> free-for-all<00:02:56.970> kind

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
whatever they want to free-for-all kind

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.210 
whatever they want to free-for-all kind
of<00:02:57.240> thing<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.110> three<00:02:58.380> protagonists<00:02:58.950> will<00:02:59.040> feel

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
of thing so three protagonists will feel

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.590 
of thing so three protagonists will feel
natural<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.820> will<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.180> feel<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
natural and will not feel like a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.330 
natural and will not feel like a
balancing<00:03:01.140> act<00:03:01.260> allowing<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> game<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> feel

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
balancing act allowing the game to feel

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.340 
balancing act allowing the game to feel
more<00:03:02.550> natural<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.600> Franklin<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.110> Michael

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
more natural so if Franklin and Michael

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.780 
more natural so if Franklin and Michael
are<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> car<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.100> drive<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.430> Michael

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
are in a car you can drive as Michael

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
switch to Franklin and Michael will

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
switch to Franklin and Michael will
continue<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.830> drive<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.940> shooting<00:03:09.270> steps
