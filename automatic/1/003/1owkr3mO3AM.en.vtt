00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.730
 for more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.730
 ah 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.550
 so much 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 increase 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.250
 in this part of the experiment we have 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.060
 a bottle of water with liquid with 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 pink artificial coloring we place you 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.490
 a tube of a pen with plasticine this 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.260
 will help us to mark where 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.640
 the water arrives and to mark the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.619
 difference of how far it will go 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.619
 when we put the hot water 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.170
 here we are placing the brand where 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.640
 the water arrives mainly without having 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.640
 placed next to hot still 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.080
 here I will go through the abarth that is 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.030
 living in the stove to place it in 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.180
 the container with the water bottle 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.180
 tibia 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.980
 when placing the water what is going to happen 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.260
 is that the water molecules in the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 bottle will start to heat up and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.940
 consequently, they will advance to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.849
 expand will increase its size is 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.519
 that's why as we can see in the tube 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.140
 from the pen the water starts to rise and 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.510
 this way you will get to a brand 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.959
 determined that we're going to next 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.959
 show 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.210
 and well this was the measure 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.780
 how much the water was seen after 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.580
 get warm 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.580
 place in the brand 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.580
 Thank you
