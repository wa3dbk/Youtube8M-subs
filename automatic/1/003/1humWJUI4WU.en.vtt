my Hama beads things so I just put like

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.680 
my Hama beads things so I just put like
parchment<00:00:16.080> paper<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.039> type<00:00:17.400> thing<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
parchment paper that type thing over the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
parchment paper that type thing over the
entire<00:00:19.170> um

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
entire um

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.560 
entire um
objects<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:23.250> within<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.420> an

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
objects and then I go within with an

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
objects and then I go within with an
iron<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.650> small<00:00:26.010> circular<00:00:26.310> motions

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
iron and I go in small circular motions

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.050 
iron and I go in small circular motions
and<00:00:27.289> make<00:00:28.289> sure<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.070> edges<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.550> well

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and make sure to get the edges very well

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
and make sure to get the edges very well
because<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:31.349> anything<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.040> close<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.489> mostly

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
because if anything is close it's mostly

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.319 
because if anything is close it's mostly
there<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> middle<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> bigger<00:00:34.350> pieces

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
there or in the middle of bigger pieces

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.470 
there or in the middle of bigger pieces
so<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.140> slowly<00:00:37.680> upwards<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.670> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
so I'm just going slowly upwards and you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
so I'm just going slowly upwards and you
can<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.829> starting<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.370> melt<00:00:41.700> when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
can see that it's starting to melt when

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
can see that it's starting to melt when
it's<00:00:42.270> kind<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.960> getting<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.440> sticky<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it's kind of getting a little sticky to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.889 
it's kind of getting a little sticky to
paper<00:00:45.289> make<00:00:46.289> sure<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> keep<00:00:47.280> using<00:00:47.899> baking

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
paper make sure you keep using baking

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.810 
paper make sure you keep using baking
paper<00:00:49.230> though<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> doesn't<00:00:50.370> stick<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
paper though so it doesn't stick to the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
paper though so it doesn't stick to the
paper<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> can't<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> off<00:00:53.360> yeah<00:00:54.469> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
paper and you can't get it off yeah so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.680 
paper and you can't get it off yeah so
just<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:56.129> over<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.730> entire<00:00:57.120> thing<00:00:57.510> and

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.820 

sometimes<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.899> also<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> correct

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
sometimes you also have to correct

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.780 
sometimes you also have to correct
mistakes<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.750> some<00:01:06.750> beads<00:01:06.990> might<00:01:07.260> pop<00:01:07.500> up

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
mistakes or some beads might pop up

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:18.679 
mistakes or some beads might pop up
anything<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:10.040> yeah

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.239 

what<00:01:19.689> I'm<00:01:19.780> doing<00:01:20.020> now<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.289> I'm<00:01:20.409> going<00:01:20.710> over<00:01:20.950> to

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
what I'm doing now is I'm going over to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.569 
what I'm doing now is I'm going over to
ears<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:23.229> will<00:01:23.259> check<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:23.950> everything

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
okay so I'm going to lift up the paper

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.160 
okay so I'm going to lift up the paper
and<00:01:26.679> check<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.310> your<00:01:27.429> feed<00:01:27.609> sort<00:01:27.909> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and check it and your feed sort of

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
following up with the paper and then

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.779 
following up with the paper and then
often<00:01:32.499> there<00:01:32.709> are<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.219> that's<00:01:33.310> why<00:01:33.549> I'm<00:01:33.609> so

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
often there are and that's why I'm so

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.429 
often there are and that's why I'm so
careful<00:01:34.240> because<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.719> don't<00:01:34.869> want<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.109> ruin<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
careful because I don't want to ruin the

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:45.630 
careful because I don't want to ruin the
piece<00:01:35.679> if<00:01:35.890> there<00:01:36.069> are<00:01:36.219> any<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:44.219> as<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:45.429> can<00:01:45.579> see

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
piece if there are any so as you can see

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.089 
piece if there are any so as you can see
it's<00:01:46.000> not<00:01:46.119> covering<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.990> whole<00:01:47.439> tail<00:01:47.770> so

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
it's not covering the whole tail so

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.240 
it's not covering the whole tail so
we'll<00:01:48.280> take<00:01:48.579> it<00:01:48.759> off<00:01:48.879> and<00:01:49.149> place<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.569> over<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
we'll take it off and place it over that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
we'll take it off and place it over that
way<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.869> turned<00:01:53.530> pale<00:01:54.189> properly

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.940 

and<00:02:11.450> now<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.600> time<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:13.020> me<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.170> iron<00:02:13.710> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and now it's time for me to iron the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.330 
and now it's time for me to iron the
other<00:02:14.130> side<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.300> usually<00:02:15.960> carry<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:17.010> entire

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.830 
of thing it doesn't matter which side is
up<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.430> you're<00:02:50.580> writing<00:02:50.820> letters<00:02:51.330> then

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
up but if you're writing letters then

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.170 
up but if you're writing letters then
make<00:02:52.170> sure<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.920> side<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
make sure that the side that is the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.020 
make sure that the side that is the
right<00:02:54.210> way<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:56.070> rightmost<00:02:56.580> even<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.730> this

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
right way is the rightmost even so this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.630 
right way is the rightmost even so this
will<00:03:00.270> also<00:03:00.420> make<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.080> piece<00:03:01.710> look<00:03:01.980> better<00:03:02.340> if

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
will also make the piece look better if

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.200 
will also make the piece look better if
you're<00:03:02.850> going<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.210> hang<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.600> or<00:03:03.840> sell<00:03:04.080> it
