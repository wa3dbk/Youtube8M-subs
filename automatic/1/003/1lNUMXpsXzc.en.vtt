forwards<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.549> walk<00:01:45.329> forwards<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
forwards like so walk forwards when you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
forwards like so walk forwards when you
do<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.490> walk<00:01:47.640> forwards<00:01:48.090> when

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
do it if you don't walk forwards when

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.760 
do it if you don't walk forwards when
you<00:01:48.450> zoom<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> knife<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.530> gonna<00:01:49.680> work

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you zoom in a knife it's not gonna work

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.130 
you zoom in a knife it's not gonna work
so<00:01:50.159> basically<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:54.140> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
so basically you just do that and you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.980 
so basically you just do that and you
have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.439> walking<00:01:55.649> forwards<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
have to be walking forwards when you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.880 
have to be walking forwards when you
knife<00:01:58.259> also<00:01:58.850> like<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.320> see<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.710> stand

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
knife also like that see if I just stand

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.450 
knife also like that see if I just stand
still<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.899> both<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:05.040> doesn't<00:02:05.399> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
still on both of them it doesn't do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
still on both of them it doesn't do
anything<00:02:05.670> okay<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> doesn't<00:02:06.509> work<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.750> have

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
anything okay it doesn't work you have

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.900 
anything okay it doesn't work you have
to<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.200> moving<00:02:07.500> forwards<00:02:07.920> when<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.489> walk<00:02:08.670> on

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
to be moving forwards when you walk on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.820 
to be moving forwards when you walk on
and<00:02:10.819> when<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.970> knife

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
and when you knife

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.000 
and when you knife
okay<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.150> part's<00:02:14.420> pretty<00:02:14.690> simple<00:02:15.080> now

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
okay so that part's pretty simple now

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.050 
okay so that part's pretty simple now
there's<00:02:16.420> three<00:02:18.070> different<00:02:19.070> ways<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.910> do

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
there's three different ways you can do

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.850 
there's three different ways you can do
this<00:02:20.090> I'm<00:02:20.540> doing<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:20.960> right<00:02:21.140> now<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.440> TDM

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
this I'm doing this right now in TDM

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.770 
this I'm doing this right now in TDM
just<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.060> would<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.270> doing<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.600> for

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
just like you would be doing it for

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.510 
just like you would be doing it for
floaters<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.830> hit<00:02:24.980> something<00:02:25.250> it's

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
floaters so if I hit something it's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.250 
floaters so if I hit something it's
going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.880> floater<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
going to be a floater so this is the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.300 
going to be a floater so this is the
first<00:02:28.130> way<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.400> do<00:02:28.670> these<00:02:28.850> knife<00:02:29.300> lunges<00:02:29.780> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
first way to do these knife lunges and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.220 
first way to do these knife lunges and
this<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.670> I'd<00:02:32.180> say<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> second<00:02:33.110> best

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
this is I'd say this is the second best

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.690 
this is I'd say this is the second best
way<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> do<00:02:33.680> them<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:34.070> because<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.490> kind<00:02:34.670> of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
way to do them just because you kind of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.010 
way to do them just because you kind of
have<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.910> wait<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.330> bots<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.750> be<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
have to wait for the bots to be in the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.470 
have to wait for the bots to be in the
right<00:02:36.140> spot<00:02:36.670> cuz<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.820> gotta<00:02:37.970> wait<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:38.360> we

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
right spot cuz you gotta wait for one we

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600 
right spot cuz you gotta wait for one we
like<00:02:38.660> over<00:02:38.900> there<00:02:39.020> or<00:02:39.200> something<00:02:39.460> or<00:02:40.460> if

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
like over there or something or if

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.520 
like over there or something or if
you're<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:40.910> off<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.170> wait<00:02:42.290> for<00:02:42.440> them

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
you're going off this in a wait for them

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.740 
you're going off this in a wait for them
to<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.710> on<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> other<00:02:43.040> side<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.450> little

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
to be on the other side so it's a little

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.410 
to be on the other side so it's a little
bit<00:02:44.840> harder<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.740> do<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.090> cooler

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
bit harder to do this but it is cooler

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.440 
bit harder to do this but it is cooler
because<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:48.080> floaters<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.300> yeah<00:02:50.300> that's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
because it's floaters and yeah that's

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.540 
because it's floaters and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:50.600> much<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.930> for<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:52.310> other

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
pretty much it for this one the other

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.220 
pretty much it for this one the other
way<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:53.060> set<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.570> up<00:02:53.600> for<00:02:53.660> capture<00:02:54.110> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
way you can set it up for capture the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.860 
way you can set it up for capture the
flag<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.450> set<00:02:56.450> up<00:02:56.540> your<00:02:56.660> capture

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
flag you can just set up your capture

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.320 
flag you can just set up your capture
the<00:02:57.050> flag<00:02:57.170> game<00:02:57.470> mode<00:02:57.740> so<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.640> bots<00:02:58.820> will<00:02:59.030> set

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
the flag game mode so the bots will set

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.820 
the flag game mode so the bots will set
up<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.750> try<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> capture<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.350> flag<00:03:00.500> with<00:03:00.740> the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
up and try to capture the flag with the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.830 
up and try to capture the flag with the
camera<00:03:01.130> turn<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:02.150> way<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.390> could<00:03:02.600> have

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
camera turn it that way you could have

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.080 
camera turn it that way you could have
all<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.200> bots<00:03:03.380> set<00:03:04.130> up<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.490> general<00:03:04.910> area

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
all the bots set up in this general area

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.640 
all the bots set up in this general area
and<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.480> could<00:03:05.630> knife<00:03:05.780> lunch<00:03:06.080> off<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.410> thing

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and you could knife lunch off this thing

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.800 
and you could knife lunch off this thing
it's<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.730> little<00:03:07.820> bit<00:03:07.970> harder<00:03:08.300> because<00:03:08.450> not<00:03:08.780> all

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
it's a little bit harder because not all

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.150 
it's a little bit harder because not all
the<00:03:08.990> bots<00:03:09.200> are<00:03:09.350> going<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.530> stand<00:03:09.740> on<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.920> flag

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
the bots are going to stand on the flag

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.290 
the bots are going to stand on the flag
a<00:03:10.190> lot<00:03:10.550> of<00:03:10.640> them<00:03:10.730> are<00:03:10.820> just<00:03:10.850> going<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.209> be

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
a lot of them are just going to be

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.600 
a lot of them are just going to be
running<00:03:11.540> around<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.840> map<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:13.250> it's<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.520> little

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
running around the map so it's a little

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.340 
running around the map so it's a little
bit<00:03:13.700> harder<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.240> sense<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:14.870> can<00:03:15.110> put

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
bit harder in that sense but you can put

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.470 
bit harder in that sense but you can put
the<00:03:15.440> bots<00:03:15.620> wherever<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.190> want<00:03:16.480> essentially

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
the bots wherever you want essentially

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.620 
the bots wherever you want essentially
so<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.530> part<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:19.100> kind<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.000> bonus<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.540> can

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
so that part is kind of a bonus you can

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.630 
so that part is kind of a bonus you can
just<00:03:20.810> put<00:03:20.930> them<00:03:21.019> wherever<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.350> want<00:03:21.650> which<00:03:22.430> is

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
just put them wherever you want which is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.940 
just put them wherever you want which is
cool<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.810> third<00:03:24.170> way<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.410> do<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:24.739> is

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
cool and the third way to do this is

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.360 
cool and the third way to do this is
split<00:03:25.910> screen<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.600> could<00:03:26.810> just<00:03:27.590> sign<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.310> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
split screen you could just sign it I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.970 
split screen you could just sign it I
got<00:03:28.519> another<00:03:28.910> controller<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.780> just<00:03:30.440> not<00:03:30.769> have

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
got another controller and just not have

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.970 
got another controller and just not have
any<00:03:31.130> bots<00:03:31.370> on<00:03:31.580> at<00:03:31.730> all<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.690> only<00:03:33.410> bad<00:03:33.560> part<00:03:33.590> is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
any bots on at all the only bad part is

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.800 
any bots on at all the only bad part is
one<00:03:34.430> obviously<00:03:34.910> it's<00:03:35.120> going<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.360> be<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.540> split

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
one obviously it's going to be in split

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.479 
one obviously it's going to be in split
screen<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:37.090> it's<00:03:38.090> going<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.269> look<00:03:38.360> kind<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.870> bad

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
screen so it's going to look kind of bad

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.430 
screen so it's going to look kind of bad
before<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.790> kill<00:03:41.000> cam<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.570> also<00:03:42.019> on<00:03:42.140> split

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
before the kill cam and also on split

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.949 
before the kill cam and also on split
screen<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:43.010> can't<00:03:43.250> spin<00:03:43.519> as<00:03:43.670> fast<00:03:43.810> I'm<00:03:44.810> not

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
screen you can't spin as fast I'm not

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.170 
screen you can't spin as fast I'm not
exactly<00:03:45.260> sure<00:03:45.470> how<00:03:45.860> fast<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.340> can<00:03:46.370> spin<00:03:46.880> but

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
exactly sure how fast you can spin but

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.050 
exactly sure how fast you can spin but
um<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:48.440> was<00:03:48.800> testing<00:03:49.130> out<00:03:49.190> out<00:03:49.340> earlier<00:03:49.730> and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
um I was testing out out earlier and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.340 
um I was testing out out earlier and
doing<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.480> knife<00:03:50.660> lunge<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:51.200> here<00:03:51.620> with<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.850> guy

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
doing a knife lunge up here with the guy

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.570 
doing a knife lunge up here with the guy
your<00:03:54.350> other<00:03:54.500> split<00:03:54.830> screen<00:03:55.130> controller

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
your other split screen controller

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.060 
your other split screen controller
standing<00:03:56.090> over<00:03:56.510> here<00:03:56.720> like<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.080> top<00:03:57.230> here<00:03:57.560> you

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
standing over here like on top here you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.790 
standing over here like on top here you
can<00:03:58.250> barely<00:03:58.640> do<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> 720<00:03:59.630> so<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.500> spend

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
can barely do like a 720 so you spend

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.229 
can barely do like a 720 so you spend
pretty<00:04:01.010> slow<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.400> split<00:04:01.760> screen<00:04:02.030> which<00:04:02.209> is

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
pretty slow and split screen which is

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.250 
pretty slow and split screen which is
kind<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.350> only<00:04:03.530> bad<00:04:04.250> part<00:04:04.540> but<00:04:05.540> yeah

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
kind of the only bad part but yeah

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.729 
kind of the only bad part but yeah
there's<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:06.860> positives<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.640> negatives

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
there's a this positives and negatives

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.949 
there's a this positives and negatives
to<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.580> ways<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:10.970> doing<00:04:11.269> this<00:04:11.299> I'm<00:04:11.750> just

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
to all the ways of doing this I'm just

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.960 
to all the ways of doing this I'm just
doing<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.350> in<00:04:12.500> here<00:04:12.860> because<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.519> like<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.910> the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
doing it in here because I like this the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.060 
doing it in here because I like this the
best<00:04:14.290> capture<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.350> flag<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.709> still<00:04:15.830> pretty

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
best capture the flag is still pretty

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.590 
best capture the flag is still pretty
good<00:04:16.310> but<00:04:16.609> split<00:04:16.910> screen<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.269> just<00:04:17.330> kind<00:04:17.570> of

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
good but split screen is just kind of

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.690 
good but split screen is just kind of
like<00:04:17.720> last<00:04:17.959> resort<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.590> really<00:04:18.859> can't<00:04:19.100> get

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
like last resort you really can't get

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.820 
like last resort you really can't get
the<00:04:19.820> knife<00:04:20.000> lunge<00:04:20.239> without<00:04:20.739> having<00:04:21.739> it

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
the knife lunge without having it

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.590 
the knife lunge without having it
another<00:04:22.190> person<00:04:22.580> set<00:04:22.970> up<00:04:23.120> right<00:04:23.390> in<00:04:23.419> that

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
another person set up right in that

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.010 
another person set up right in that
specific<00:04:23.810> spot

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
specific spot

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.809 
specific spot
so<00:04:25.139> I'm<00:04:25.440> just<00:04:25.620> gonna<00:04:25.800> go<00:04:26.370> over<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.580> one<00:04:26.759> more

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
so I'm just gonna go over this one more

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.550 
so I'm just gonna go over this one more
time<00:04:27.150> zoom<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.940> walk<00:04:29.940> forwards<00:04:30.449> knife<00:04:31.139> it's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
time zoom in walk forwards knife it's

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.200 
time zoom in walk forwards knife it's
not<00:04:31.740> gonna<00:04:31.860> let<00:04:31.949> your<00:04:32.099> knife<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.550> then<00:04:33.090> you

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
not gonna let your knife and then you

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.089 
not gonna let your knife and then you
want<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.389> be<00:04:33.479> slowly<00:04:33.810> knifing<00:04:34.379> slowly<00:04:34.860> walking

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
want to be slowly knifing slowly walking

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.309 
want to be slowly knifing slowly walking
forwards<00:04:35.610> when<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:35.879> knife<00:04:36.090> okay<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.080> that's

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
forwards when you knife okay so that's

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.710 
forwards when you knife okay so that's
pretty<00:04:37.500> much<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.919> basics<00:04:38.610> for<00:04:38.789> this<00:04:38.970> now

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
pretty much the basics for this now

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.649 
pretty much the basics for this now
there's<00:04:40.169> um<00:04:40.590> there's<00:04:41.069> one<00:04:41.909> way<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.270> can<00:04:42.509> do

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
there's um there's one way you can do

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:43.760 
there's um there's one way you can do
this<00:04:42.780> where<00:04:43.020> it's<00:04:43.110> going<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.289> make<00:04:43.409> you<00:04:43.560> lunch

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
this where it's going to make you lunch

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.350 
this where it's going to make you lunch
even<00:04:44.099> higher<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:44.909> i'm<00:04:45.030> going<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.180> show<00:04:45.330> you

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
even higher so i'm going to show you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.960 
even higher so i'm going to show you
example<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:45.930> what<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.139> looks<00:04:46.289> like<00:04:46.460> before<00:04:47.460> you

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
example of what it looks like before you

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.700 
example of what it looks like before you
do<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.419> a<00:04:48.479> specific<00:04:48.690> way<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.110> then<00:04:49.409> after

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
do it in a specific way and then after

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.010 
do it in a specific way and then after
so<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.039> is<00:04:50.159> what<00:04:50.280> i<00:04:50.310> was<00:04:50.580> doing<00:04:50.759> before<00:04:51.020> he

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
so this is what i was doing before he

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.850 
so this is what i was doing before he
just<00:04:52.229> like<00:04:52.560> shocked<00:04:53.009> judge<00:04:53.250> cancel<00:04:53.729> and

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
just like shocked judge cancel and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.140 
just like shocked judge cancel and
that's<00:04:55.860> pretty<00:04:56.099> much<00:04:56.220> how<00:04:56.580> high<00:04:56.759> you<00:04:56.819> would<00:04:57.000> go

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
that's pretty much how high you would go

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.659 
that's pretty much how high you would go
right<00:04:57.300> there<00:04:57.630> doing<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.949> normal<00:04:59.159> way<00:04:59.340> but

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
right there doing it the normal way but

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.939 
right there doing it the normal way but
if<00:05:00.449> you<00:05:00.599> hold<00:05:00.900> out<00:05:01.050> whatever<00:05:01.409> your<00:05:01.710> knife

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
if you hold out whatever your knife

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.460 
if you hold out whatever your knife
cancelling<00:05:02.520> with<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.909> little<00:05:03.599> bit<00:05:03.720> longer<00:05:03.990> if

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
cancelling with a little bit longer if

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.809 
cancelling with a little bit longer if
you<00:05:04.590> hold<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:04.889> like<00:05:04.919> as<00:05:05.159> long<00:05:05.190> as<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.610> can

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
you hold it like as long as you can

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.580 
you hold it like as long as you can
you're<00:05:06.449> gonna<00:05:06.539> go<00:05:06.750> higher<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.020> you're<00:05:07.470> going

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
you're gonna go higher and you're going
