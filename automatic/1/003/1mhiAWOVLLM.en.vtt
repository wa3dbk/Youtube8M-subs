00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 besides youtuber good and bad being the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.120
 samsung galaxy s3 mini invited them to their 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
 and you go to my channel to this video that is 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.740
 very short and very simple I bring not them 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.450
 It may seem like a little 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.160
 necessary but surely if they are 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.350
 seeing is because they looked for it and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 I will teach how to remove the lid on samsung 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.410
 galaxy s3 mini is very simple is the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 top simply requires putting the nail 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 over here and make a and pull the lid towards 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 back we're going to do then first that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.359
 all turn off the phone and we pay the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.610
 phone in case we want 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.980
 until the stage to change the battery or 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 change the micro sd or change the sim 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 card we simply wait for the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.890
 phone at the same time we turn off and remember 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.480
 that the folder has a small sample 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.790
 and what we should do is 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.399
 just enter our fingers by 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.370
 here do a little pressure towards 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.500
 back as you will see the part was already withdrawn 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.410
 go forward and put the nail here 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.960
 we take a tour of the edges and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.269
 that way we can remove the lid without 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.190
 make a lot of effort and now we have 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.250
 a lot of confidence with the lid this stage 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.290
 Polycarbonate Polycarbonate lid 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.780
 very strong normally what one does 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.479
 is to enter the nail and remove the lid 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 being a bit of force we should not 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.410
 of products are those by iran and that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.300
 stage as I told you is very strong and 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.680
 outside that is very economical easily 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.170
 can get a replacement this stage 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 so it's easy to remove the lid on 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.820
 samsung galaxy is 3 min to enter 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.820
 simply put back what 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.520
 we do is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.409
 either above or below or we 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 can obviate by those little notches 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.760
 these little notches are the ones that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.070
 they stay here simply what 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.650
 we can start it by putting it down 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.020
 there's down, it was perfectly placed and 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.710
 we are doing pressure by their sides 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.220
 very gently and so they are again 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 the lid on without having to do much 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.540
 effort on her 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.299
 so it's simple was again in the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.429
 phone with its lid on we are going to 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.039
 remove it again very quickly 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.230
 brad and jen we enter the finger the nail 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.230
 up here makes a little pressure 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.550
 as we have done the little 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.030
 Pressure 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.250
 let's go back remember that sometimes 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.620
 this can generate a little bit of fear and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.230
 go to damage the lid then the best thing is 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.260
 and the removed and little more puts the other 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.950
 time in that attempt says it very very 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.230
 necessarily here we removed a little 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.110
 I really did hard what I did not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.060
 I want to teach them to simply do what 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.980
 that we put our finger here a little 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.840
 As you will see by removing and 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.660
 because the side was removed more we use 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.630
 the nail and we make a tour through 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.200
 of the phone by its edges to go 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.540
 gently removing go by removing 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.819
 and so it's simple we remove it without 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 put less today broken cover 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.800
 of the year but as I said earlier 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.180
 this stage is very resistant by the 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.180
 video thank you very much for the video
