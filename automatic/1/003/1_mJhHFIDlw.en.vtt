00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.330
 one of the main pests in apple cultivation 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.580
 the apple wrapper is the unwinder 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.410
 In the middle of May the fly will start 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.840
 gifted females then lay on the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.029
 small fruits from their eggs and the 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.830
 the caterpillars slip out of the eggs and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.759
 these robberies are boring in the apple 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.999
 cologne the conclusion of them out and 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.179
 make the fruit inferior 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:33.260
 So inedible or fall the apples 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.990
 then already at the tree and perish 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.200
 for that reason you have to go against the 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.330
 take action and we 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.700
 We decided to have a beer 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.340
 technical measure to use 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.180
 That's the confusion in the mess 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 one uses the sexual communication of the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.200
 settler in favor of fruit and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.230
 although one uses the spencer's 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.270
 you hang in the plants from the end of april 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.409
 this distance results in a sex hormone 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.630
 from a so-called pheromone and this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 pheromone settles as a very big one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.490
 cloud over the whole apple plant and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.140
 this leads to the fact that the male the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.539
 females can no longer find them 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 can not be based on the smell 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.319
 because they just believe there is only 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.999
 female in the plant you will find her 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.539
 not for mating therefore there is also 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.799
 no eggs on the apples and 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.389
 As a result, no warning 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.450
 that's a very simple trick of the 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:38.850
 this leads to no insecticide 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.729
 to carry out spraying against the defense 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.759
 what must be in turn for the one 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.319
 user and for the environment a big one 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 advantage is and ultimately natural 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.569
 first and foremost the consumer too good 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.579
 there is no residue with 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.270
 insecticides then on the jars again 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.270
 can be found
