00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.689
 two 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.310
 I used this piece of my cage 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.700
 good friend n to explain how she has 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 what to be 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.200
 the ideal cage of a chinchilla and how 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.419
 You see the first thing that draws attention is 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.579
 height and dimensions 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.680
 chinchillas need a lot of space 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.110
 because they are very athletes they love 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.510
 jump from one platform to another we 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.010
 we have invented this structure that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.079
 It is normally sold for cats because 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.970
 has several platforms and because it has 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.390
 several holes where they like 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.970
 be as well as you know the chinchillas 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.060
 they are animals that live in the highlands 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.150
 from the Andes mountain range this is 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.090
 that live on rocks and practically not 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.770
 there is no vegetation removing therefore the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.570
 hay and herbs but yes there are 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.210
 many rocks and many holes where 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.070
 they like to get in and where they like 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.470
 jump, well, you are going to see that they are very 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.079
 athletes they jump a lot and they do 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.689
 a lot of exercise as well you see the 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.880
 The most important measure of the cage is 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.720
 a little the height and the width has to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.340
 have space 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.180
 as I already told you to give those 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.740
 jump and then we will cover this 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.680
 but now I want before I cover what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.660
 you can approach a little and see a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.760
 little how are these recesses these 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.440
 cottages ideally for each chinchilla 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.030
 that there has to be a gap 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.010
 to have a little house and if you see each 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.530
 one usually likes to be in a 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.980
 different site although in this case 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.780
 Both Nile and Mesh are pairs but 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.930
 well, if you see here, everyone has it 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.170
 in a different place as you can see 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.990
 also all the soil is composed or 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.880
 is full of paper nature leader 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 you already know very well what is this 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.940
 substrate that is what we 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.890
 we recommend for practically all 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.080
 the pets because it is a floor that is 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.900
 made from newspaper and is 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.770
 completely innocuous for them another 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.020
 section where we will put the food and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.780
 a very important thing in chinchillas 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.690
 is the bathroom with sand if you want 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.690
 I will show you 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.710
 as nilo uses it we have put 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.770
 inside your house the sand and here the 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.770
 you have 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.730
 is very similar to beach sand and 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.480
 you will find in practically all 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.480
 the animal stores 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.030
 it's one it's going to cost us it's a sand 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.310
 special is called sand for bathroom 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.610
 chinchilla and it's a sand they use 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.970
 to scrub and keep healthy and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.030
 clean his coat so more or less the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.100
 structure is here you see the whole 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.240
 try to recreate the closest thing to this 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.010
 possible and now I will ask for the help of my 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.780
 favorite sound technician called 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.940
 jordi I hope you help me to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.900
 place the top part to the cage 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.920
 hello jordi 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.959
 we go there very carefully 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.420
 you have to tilt a little bit so you do not 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.810
 center 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.810
 there 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.480
 perfect 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.370
 we will fix the cage 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.780
 down 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.550
 phenomenal 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.370
 and more or less you see how the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.550
 structure of an ideal cage for 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.110
 chinchilla is a bit cumbersome because 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.319
 It is very voluminous and you will have to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.250
 handle between two people and finally 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.569
 let's put a little bit of food and the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.569
 water that has no mystery 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.710
 the chinchillas are mountain animals 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.140
 therefore the cold they hold it enough 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.330
 well you have to have in this case more 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.460
 be careful with the heat very careful 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.320
 when the hostels at home on terraces 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.260
 glazed windows that can be reheated 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.730
 too much water is worth at a level that 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.420
 can do without problem 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.410
 and a little handful 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.720
 of food that food already contains hay 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.420
 that the animal needs and as I said 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.420
 cold without any problems are 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.760
 animals with hair one of the hairs 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.550
 denser nature prepared 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.610
 to withstand temperatures at 4000 meters 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.350
 of height so imagine yourself but a lot 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.570
 careful with the heat especially with the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.340
 Sun exposure and direct above all 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.620
 temperatures rise above and 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.540
 28 degrees can already mean a 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.340
 problem and always fresh and clean water 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.630
 at your disposal like all animals 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.630
 Thank you so much guys
