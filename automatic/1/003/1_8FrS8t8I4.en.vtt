 no no I am drawn to ends 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.040

 identity take back your name 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.969
 abused by the clan 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.450
 when they ask me for my colludes where 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.730

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.000
 pride pulls it all out to the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 the same way the casalesi that one behind 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.200
 the other offer themselves as ambassadors 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.930
 of their own land to welcome 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.390
 tourists and tell them the beauty in a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.090
 extraordinary project that looks like one 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.829
 madness as all challenges bring works 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.500
 prestigious of the most important museum 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.969
 and dozens of men and women of casal di 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.430
 prince to build the real body 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 diplomatic of this revolution is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
 the opportunity to resolve once for 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.600
 all the theme in the shadows 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.030
 because here the Camorra has really lost and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.830
 trust is winning the works 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 the common theme will arrive in June 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 contrast between light and shadow is the title 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.210
 of the exhibition offers the meaning of 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 challenge that also a chance to go 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.259
 beyond to exceed the limits exceeded 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.479
 once he sometimes says I can go there or 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 I can't go there but so can we when 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.780
 we entered here we can enter or not 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 we can enter the person who was 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.950
 off we drove revenue there 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.939
 worry don't bag then enter e 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 is a moment to go through the door 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780
 hard 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.780

 villa confiscated a camorrista then 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.690
 abandoned for years and now transformed 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.640
 in a museum or not I call the presence 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 organized number does not call me there 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.420
 were tragic phenomena in this 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.920
 our reality but today we think that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.080
 is a reconstruction phase there 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.270
 reconstruction of a sense of community of 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.399
 a real community and art e 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.090
