00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.730
 hello here we are sitting deep in the rolli 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.100
 then maybe you can collapse 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.100

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.509

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.009
 Thank you sammer are you with the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.000
 camera because I think that fits the 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.529
 Wheelchair not at all 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.559

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.730
 I even have a wheelchair 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.930
 it is so very easy 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.220
 athletic to fold the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.280
 Do you take it everywhere and irony is 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.239
 very sparse 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.930
 why can not you push yourself? 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.309

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.770
 I feel a little bit in my situation 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.910
 I would like comfort when I walk 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.910
 then i could run 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.190
 say, and if we are very slow 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:02.380
 ancestors I 'm sorry 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.220
 our minibuses with ramp are almost 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.140
 all on the way 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.630
 the next one is in at least one 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.760
 hour there are mine again 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.930
 usually that comes but bowl 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.780
 these 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.090
 It is not serious 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:40.460
 so once the first stock I have in front of him 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.460
 drives, there are the few meters 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.950

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 class belt I'm off white 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.910
 also regine when you hear this environment 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.910
 I 'm not telling you alone 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.069

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.569

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.800
