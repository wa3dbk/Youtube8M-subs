like that that's why I will demonstrate
right<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> springs<00:01:19.679> in<00:01:19.829> place

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.459 

notice<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.299> defender<00:01:24.749> came<00:01:25.020> over<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
notice that the defender came over to

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.469 
notice that the defender came over to
block<00:01:25.740> me<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.219> was<00:01:26.399> just<00:01:26.429> passing<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.179> once

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
block me but I was just passing out once

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.499 
block me but I was just passing out once
I<00:01:27.630> beat<00:01:27.840> level<00:01:28.079> one<00:01:28.469> I<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.609> move<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.999> I'll

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I beat level one I want to move on I'll

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.789 
I beat level one I want to move on I'll
just<00:01:30.630> look<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.020> springs<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.649> little

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
just look at the springs here a little

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.520 
just look at the springs here a little
more<00:01:31.890> closely<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.749> this<00:01:33.810> again

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
more closely so if I this again

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.849 
more closely so if I this again
represents<00:01:35.069> level<00:01:35.399> one<00:01:35.609> spring<00:01:36.090> two

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
represents level one spring two

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.209 
represents level one spring two
represents<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:37.920> level<00:01:38.219> two<00:01:38.460> level<00:01:39.619> three<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
represents the level two level three you

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.770 
represents the level two level three you
put<00:01:41.609> both<00:01:41.850> Springs<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:43.109> and<00:01:43.380> two<00:01:43.619> together

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
put both Springs one and two together

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.459 
put both Springs one and two together
level<00:01:45.780> four<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.439> spring<00:01:49.590> by<00:01:49.920> itself

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
level four is the for spring by itself

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.719 
level four is the for spring by itself
five<00:01:52.469> is

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
five is

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.029 
five is
four<00:01:55.390> plus<00:01:55.600> one<00:01:56.880> six<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.299> four<00:01:59.259> plus<00:01:59.409> two<00:01:59.530> and

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
four plus one six is four plus two and

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.109 
four plus one six is four plus two and
level<00:02:01.000> 7<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:02.009> 4<00:02:03.009> plus<00:02:03.250> two<00:02:03.399> plus<00:02:03.549> one<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:04.030> you

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
level 7 is 4 plus two plus one so you

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.999 
level 7 is 4 plus two plus one so you
just<00:02:04.270> add<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.780> bands<00:02:05.020> together<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.740> get<00:02:05.829> the

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
just add the bands together to get the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.580 
just add the bands together to get the
level<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.490> will<00:02:07.360> go<00:02:08.080> ahead<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.259> demonstrate

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
level I will go ahead and demonstrate

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.750 
level I will go ahead and demonstrate
with<00:02:09.129> level<00:02:09.459> four<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.840> show<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:12.489> can<00:02:12.700> be

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
with level four to show that it can be

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.210 
with level four to show that it can be
quite<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> bit<00:02:13.209> quicker<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.769> move<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.099> in

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
quite a bit quicker when you move up in

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.440 
quite a bit quicker when you move up in
levels<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.450> here's<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.810> level<00:02:20.170> four<00:02:20.380> shot

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
levels so here's a level four shot

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.759 
levels so here's a level four shot
notice<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.810> time<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.140> didn't<00:02:23.530> shoot<00:02:23.709> the

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
notice that that time I didn't shoot the

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.150 
notice that that time I didn't shoot the
shot<00:02:24.040> fast<00:02:24.549> enough<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:26.709> guy<00:02:26.890> beat<00:02:27.130> me

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
shot fast enough and this guy beat me

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.229 
shot fast enough and this guy beat me
that's<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.849> point

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
that's the point

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.229 
that's the point
is<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:30.160> get<00:02:30.310> better<00:02:30.580> by<00:02:30.849> trying<00:02:31.090> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
is that you you get better by trying to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.330 
is that you you get better by trying to
beat<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.569> guy<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.380> let<00:02:32.530> me<00:02:32.620> try<00:02:32.769> harder<00:02:33.010> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
beat this guy so let me try harder this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.160 
beat this guy so let me try harder this
time<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.760> speed<00:02:34.030> make<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> level<00:02:34.720> four<00:02:34.930> shot<00:02:37.170> to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
time to speed make a level four shot to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.920 
time to speed make a level four shot to
get<00:02:38.410> through<00:02:38.650> all<00:02:38.799> all<00:02:39.160> seven<00:02:39.790> levels<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.420> you

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
get through all all seven levels and you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.400 
get through all all seven levels and you
want<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.200> move<00:02:41.319> up<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:43.180> higher<00:02:43.390> levels<00:02:43.840> you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
want to move up to the higher levels you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.920 
want to move up to the higher levels you
actually<00:02:44.769> move<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.340> spring<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.630> different

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
actually move the spring to a different

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.160 
actually move the spring to a different
position<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.410> move<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.709> down<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.220> between<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
position you move it down to between the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.009 
position you move it down to between the
second<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.290> third<00:02:50.760> three<00:02:51.760> men<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.329> then

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
second and third three men and then

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.750 
second and third three men and then
between<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:54.269> last<00:02:55.269> man<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.500> two<00:02:57.040> men<00:02:57.220> rod<00:02:57.459> and

tip<00:03:36.969> up<00:03:37.150> you're<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.500> put<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.189> in<00:03:39.310> that

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
tip up you're going in put it in that

little hole push down and then slide it
into<00:03:43.329> place<00:03:44.250> basically<00:03:45.250> what<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.609> does<00:03:45.909> is

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
into place basically what this does is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.170 
into place basically what this does is
leaves<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.530> corners<00:03:47.950> open<00:03:48.159> and<00:03:48.579> forces<00:03:49.090> you

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
