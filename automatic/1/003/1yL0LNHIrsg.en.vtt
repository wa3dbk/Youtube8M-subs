00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.250
 plus 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.109
 we are in the presentation of the new 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:21.640
 toyota auris let's see how much it gives of itself 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:24.289
 the 1.2 turbo logo here behind are 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.789
 laser and camera are the systems of 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.789
 safety of the new peugeot out 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 you can adjust the distance to which 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.290
 the system of paris acts 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.530
 in a fairly large space for 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.470
 legs here in the part on the right 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.380
 it does not bother me anything I have a very good 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 support for the left foot tell me 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.050
 when you saw, he had some more controls 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.759
 intuitive easier to handle the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.800
 completion perhaps these are the only 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.600
 a little complicated because they are muscles 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.229
 rotary you have to pass all 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.780
 all of them something that you know but 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.550
 here we have the help of the screen 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.869
 superior that will indicate what is 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.869
 what is happening in each moment 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.619
 the space for the legs is 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.619
 frankly good 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.630
 how can you check the space for 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.630
 The legs of the passenger is very broad 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.869
 And below 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.819
 they expand all the connectivity they have 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.310
 beware the trimmings are the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.840
 humanitos the appearance the touch of all 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.280
 the plastics above this area of 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 plastics where you have a little more 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.590
 cold actually also moves the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.650
 console are hard plastics too 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.810
 little color and well this is the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.090
 part in fried improved as there is 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.269
 say everything attentive because it is that here 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.269
 It fits a goal is deep 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.950
 and trunk that looks like it's not very 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.519
 great what happens is that below has 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.519
 a double bottom
