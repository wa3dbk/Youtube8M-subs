is of the lag there's no lag in this

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.639 
is of the lag there's no lag in this
game<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.899> hit<00:01:22.049> detection<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649

enough time to play all of them but it's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
do recommend buying it if you can and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.720 
do recommend buying it if you can and
some<00:02:25.680> things<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.980> I've<00:02:26.160> noticed<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.640> this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
some things that I've noticed in this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
some things that I've noticed in this
game<00:02:27.000> as<00:02:27.180> I'm<00:02:27.420> playing<00:02:27.630> team<00:02:27.900> deathmatch<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
game as I'm playing team deathmatch the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.250 
game as I'm playing team deathmatch the
spawn<00:02:29.280> point<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.450> crazy<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:30.989> game

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
spawn point is really crazy in this game

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710 
spawn point is really crazy in this game
people<00:02:31.860> spawn<00:02:32.340> all<00:02:32.610> over<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> place<00:02:33.269> in<00:02:33.510> team

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
people spawn all over the place in team

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.809 
people spawn all over the place in team
deathmatch<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.190> hard<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.550> spawn

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
deathmatch so it's really hard to spawn

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.759 
deathmatch so it's really hard to spawn
trapped<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.870> really<00:02:37.140> hard<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.620> keep

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
trapped and it's really hard to keep

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.470 
trapped and it's really hard to keep
track<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.099> your<00:02:38.340> enemies<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.790> where<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
track of your enemies and where the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.650 
track of your enemies and where the
spawn<00:02:39.750> points<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:41.280> learning<00:02:41.819> spawn

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
spawn points are so I'm learning spawn

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.509 
spawn points are so I'm learning spawn
point<00:02:42.959> still<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.560> once<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.980> learn<00:02:44.220> I'll

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
point still and once I learn I'll

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.550 
point still and once I learn I'll
probably<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:45.480> better<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.230> look<00:02:46.350> at<00:02:46.470> this

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
probably do better but look at this

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
probably do better but look at this
situation<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.400> know<00:02:47.970> there<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.360> guy<00:02:48.540> around

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
situation I know there is a guy around

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.570 
situation I know there is a guy around
the<00:02:48.959> corner<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.440> someone<00:02:49.799> blows<00:02:50.190> him<00:02:50.430> up

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the corner and someone blows him up

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.059 
the corner and someone blows him up
right<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:50.970> front<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.390> me<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.319> one<00:02:52.860> that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
while I was kind of shocked this game

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.809 
while I was kind of shocked this game
feels<00:03:00.299> like<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.599> movie<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.140> be<00:03:01.260> honest<00:03:01.560> and

down<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.200> when<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.799> go<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.730> approach<00:03:30.209> a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
down so when you go and approach a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.539 
down so when you go and approach a
target<00:03:31.170> just<00:03:31.590> make<00:03:31.769> sure<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:32.100> watch<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
target just make sure you watch the

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.309 
target just make sure you watch the
windows<00:03:32.910> because<00:03:33.239> usually<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.930> have<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.109> lot

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
windows because usually you have a lot

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.259 
windows because usually you have a lot
of<00:03:34.350> snipers<00:03:34.859> there<00:03:35.069> or<00:03:35.250> high<00:03:35.850> elevated

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
of snipers there or high elevated

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.569 
of snipers there or high elevated
positions<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.140> make<00:03:37.350> sure<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.859> that<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
positions so make sure you have that and

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.630 
positions so make sure you have that and
I<00:03:39.299> mean<00:03:39.810> campers<00:03:40.230> always<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.890> exist<00:03:41.190> but

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
I mean campers always going to exist but

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.910 
I mean campers always going to exist but
if<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.030> play<00:03:42.209> smart<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.530> play

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
if you play smart and you play

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830 
if you play smart and you play
strategically<00:03:44.459> then<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.209> definitely<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
strategically then you definitely have a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.870 
strategically then you definitely have a
good<00:03:45.930> game<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.530> one<00:03:47.069> thing<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.340> noticed<00:03:47.549> in

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
good game and one thing I noticed in

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.270 
good game and one thing I noticed in
this<00:03:48.000> game<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.650> absolutely<00:03:49.650> important<00:03:50.160> is

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.330 
this game is absolutely important is
flanking<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.930> think<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.410> some<00:03:52.769> degree<00:03:52.829> I've

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
flanking and I think to some degree I've

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.190 
flanking and I think to some degree I've
done<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.940> I've<00:03:54.209> been<00:03:54.480> rushing<00:03:54.780> from

done this I've been rushing from
majority<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.859> game<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.280> I've<00:03:56.730> been

majority of the game and I've been
flanking<00:03:57.420> my<00:03:57.769> enemies<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.040> that's<00:03:59.250> how<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.430> got
