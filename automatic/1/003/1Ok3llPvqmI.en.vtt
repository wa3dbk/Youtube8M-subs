00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
temperature setting it turns out to be I

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.179 

but<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.450> definitely<00:02:49.870> would<00:02:50.019> recommend<00:02:50.500> getting

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
but I definitely would recommend getting

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.660 
but I definitely would recommend getting
this<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.510> only<00:02:52.689> downfall<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.250> product

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
this the only downfall to the product

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.130 
this the only downfall to the product
that<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.959> would<00:02:56.469> see<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.219> it<00:02:57.519> would<00:02:58.180> be<00:02:58.239> no

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
that I would see in it would be no

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.280 
that I would see in it would be no
control<00:02:59.709> settings<00:03:00.099> for<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> temperature<00:03:00.939> and

control settings for the temperature and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.069 
control settings for the temperature and
the<00:03:02.290> automatic<00:03:02.650> shutoff<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
the automatic shutoff so if you

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.710 
the automatic shutoff so if you
accidentally<00:03:05.680> leave<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.720> definitely

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
accidentally leave this on definitely

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.220 
accidentally leave this on definitely
bust<00:03:08.019> that<00:03:08.170> u-turn<00:03:08.590> come<00:03:09.459> back<00:03:09.640> home<00:03:09.909> and<00:03:10.420> shut

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230
