00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello everyone with you andrew lights 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 Andreevich my site all-all dot ru 1500 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.389
 86 task find three-tenths of the number 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 150 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.080
 we have the number 150 we need from him 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.119
 find three tenths how to do it before 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.199
 you just need to multiply by 3 tenths and all 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 further find three-tenths of the number 600 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.189
 from the number 600 to find three tenths 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.700
 need what to do 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.800
 multiply by 3 tenths then we have the number 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:46.129
 what what shall we do yes the same thing 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:49.340
 the last number 5 is also multiplied by 0.3 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.340
 let's count 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.039
 so 150 multiply by 0.3 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's 03 for 003 for 5-15 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:16.409
 5 we write 1 in mind 3 by 13 to 1 you 4 0 on 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 0 0 0 to 0 0 0 to 0 0 to 10 to 5 0 and 0 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:25.350
 10 still does not work 0540 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:31.740
 commas here for one sign then and here 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:37.950
 on one sign forty five point forty five 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.400
 whole and so on, you can multiply 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.119
 principle, that's how he looks at 0.3 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.210
 multiply by 600 setting aside zeros 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.009
 then 0 and just rewrite further 6 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.780
 on 3 18 8 we write 1 in the mind 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.229
 6 to 0 0 to 1 in mind 1 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:05.880
 commas here for one sign then and here 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:10.360
 on one sign 180 180 it turns out here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.600
 generally easy to watch 0.3 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.010
 we multiply that number by 100 when we 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.760
 multiply by 100 ma simply comma 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.730
 we transfer to the right by 2 signs one-two and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.670
 Now, here is why 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.720
 so 2 characters 20 and a hundred, so two 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.270
 sign to the right 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.230
 here , no more in the empty space 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.830
 enter 0 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.480
 that there were two times that there were numbers through 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.640
 which is like stepping over then 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.770
 ahead 0 we do not need and we 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.380
 here the principle is also no longer necessary because 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.620
 that after it there are no numbers and that 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.620
 it turns 30 here it turns 30 and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:03:00.690
 the last number but the principle of the column 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:09.370
 count 5 multiply by 0.3 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:15.880
 5 to 3 15 5 we write as well and we write 15 a 0 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:18.130
 5 is 0 we add up we get 15, 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.970
 here on one sign then I'm here on one 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.709
 sign and a half 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.890
 it turns out a half and so we 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:34.000
 it turned out the values ​​are 45 180 30 and a half 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.810
 1.5 This is not such a difficult task 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.810
 all all bye
