00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:12.070
 how to grow such a miracle tree which 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.389
 called the world i'm big you can 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.740
 view this size 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:26.250
 and so we will grow it with 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:30.279
 cuttings from the cutting of a large bush 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:41.500
 I need you to cut the grafts 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:46.059
 show the size and now compare this 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.730
 we have a cutting green here with us 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:57.699
 brownish is better to take a little bit 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:01:04.560
 stiffened and shafts 58 centimeters well 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:08.790
 Here I am a little bit zilla goes 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.790
 remove the lower leaves 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.280
 here is from this cherry night to here this 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:36.460
 tree me and a half years that is growing 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.140
 he quickly takes a small 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.860
 potty 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.400
 which later we will 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.400
 transplant 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:02.149
 just pour water on the little moon 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:05.920
 we plant like ordinary plants here with me 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.920
 then our land 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:18.650
 and be sure to cover the jar plant 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:25.730
 under the jar or under the film like this 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.890
 that's the way I tried to plant without 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.770
 jars they sit a few months but 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.770
 then in the end it still does not grow 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:49.110
 I have already grown small 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.110
 tree can see 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:02.040
 here I have already cut it off how am I 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.890
 he cut off that is when our plants 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.220
 will go to growth you will see here will be 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.460
 fresh little green leaves that is they 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.090
 will differ in color being cut off 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.380
 them so the crown then I 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.320
 example is cut off the top of the head and then 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:36.660
 side leaflets here are these side 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:38.310
 leaves start to go in height 2 3 4 then 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.150
 There are four side foxes. 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.610
 I went in height, I already did the second 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.370
 pruning that is staggering shimmers you 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:56.160
 after the second cutting, I cut already here 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:00.480
 these four leaflets further on 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.250
 will we grow and this continues 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.500
 grow forking 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:13.020
 that is, it is already beginning to form 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.690
 under a piece that is, I planted this 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.690
 he was, that is, this is all that grew 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.600
