and it was phenomenal it took me a

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.480 
and it was phenomenal it took me a
little<00:00:17.330> less<00:00:17.630> than<00:00:17.779> a<00:00:17.900> week<00:00:18.110> to<00:00:18.349> to<00:00:18.800> build<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.279> I

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
little less than a week to to build it I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.409 
little less than a week to to build it I
build<00:00:20.359> it<00:00:20.480> out<00:00:20.599> of<00:00:20.829> foam<00:00:21.880> foam<00:00:22.880> that<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:23.210> got

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
build it out of foam foam that I got

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.380 
build it out of foam foam that I got
from<00:00:23.570> Home<00:00:23.840> Depot<00:00:24.259> and<00:00:24.640> also<00:00:25.640> six<00:00:25.939> millimeter

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
from Home Depot and also six millimeter

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.960

deeper<00:00:26.960> now<00:00:27.829> what<00:00:27.980> I'm<00:00:28.099> doing<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:28.550> I'm<00:00:28.759> trying

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
deeper now what I'm doing is I'm trying

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.250 
deeper now what I'm doing is I'm trying
to<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.929> make<00:00:30.109> sure<00:00:30.349> that<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:31.279> C<00:00:31.519> of<00:00:31.640> G<00:00:31.849> is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
to to make sure that the C of G is

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.520 
to to make sure that the C of G is
a-okay<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.920> battery<00:00:34.309> is<00:00:34.460> full<00:00:34.790> forward<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.870> I

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
a-okay the battery is full forward and I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.270 
a-okay the battery is full forward and I
have<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.949> pretty<00:00:37.190> big<00:00:37.400> more<00:00:37.940> or<00:00:38.120> two<00:00:38.300> but<00:00:39.280> it

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
have a pretty big more or two but it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.090 
have a pretty big more or two but it
seems<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:41.000> still<00:00:41.300> still<00:00:41.809> heavy

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.299 

now<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:50.360> take<00:00:50.629> off<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.129> break<00:00:52.129> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
now in this take off I break the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.000 
now in this take off I break the
propeller<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:53.750> don't<00:00:54.020> notice<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:54.800> I

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
propeller and I don't notice that I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.279 
propeller and I don't notice that I
broke<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:56.690> take<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.930> look<00:00:57.140> at

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
broke it so you take a look at

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.770 
broke it so you take a look at
everything<00:00:57.559> I<00:00:58.010> do<00:00:58.969> my<00:00:59.239> quick<00:00:59.480> inspection

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
everything I do my quick inspection

everything I do my quick inspection
except<00:01:00.769> that<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:00.980> didn't<00:01:01.340> see<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.489> propeller

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
except that I didn't see the propeller

first flight sounds quite heavy no it
looks<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.679> little<00:01:18.800> telltale<00:01:19.580> heavy<00:01:19.910> I'm

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
looks a little telltale heavy I'm

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.380 
looks a little telltale heavy I'm
putting<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.649> little<00:01:21.950> bit<00:01:22.039> of<00:01:22.160> trim<00:01:22.459> forward<00:01:22.729> but

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
putting a little bit of trim forward but

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.919 
putting a little bit of trim forward but
I<00:01:24.369> managed<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.399> fly<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.849> and<00:01:26.119> get<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.720> good

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
I managed to fly it and get a good

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:36.880 
I managed to fly it and get a good
landing<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:31.700> looks<00:01:31.910> good<00:01:32.179> I<00:01:33.310> like<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.489> noise

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:46.190 

you<00:01:37.460> see<00:01:37.700> in<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> CEO

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.550 

sounds<00:01:47.200> like<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.380> real<00:01:47.680> plane

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.230 

I<00:01:57.899> put<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.930> bunch<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.320> pennies<00:01:59.560> to<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.939> get<00:02:01.119> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
I put a bunch of pennies to to get the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.710 
I put a bunch of pennies to to get the
weight<00:02:01.479> in<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.409> nose<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.579> a<00:02:04.149> little<00:02:04.570> bit

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
weight in the nose and then a little bit

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:59.210 
weight in the nose and then a little bit
of<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.860> elevator

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:13.559 

it's<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.340> cool<00:03:00.520> plane<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> fly

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.420

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.850 

yeah<00:05:35.520> this<00:05:35.730> plane<00:05:36.030> is<00:05:36.240> 90<00:05:37.170> centimeters

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
yeah this plane is 90 centimeters

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.600 
yeah this plane is 90 centimeters
wingspan<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.880> 80<00:05:39.750> cm<00:05:40.050> x<00:05:40.350> NT<00:05:40.590> meters<00:05:40.950> long<00:05:41.250> and

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
wingspan and 80 cm x NT meters long and

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.870 
wingspan and 80 cm x NT meters long and
it's<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:42.030> point<00:05:42.330> 75<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:46.430> blender<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.640> the

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
it's a point 75 of the blender that the

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.170 
it's a point 75 of the blender that the
guys<00:05:48.150> from<00:05:48.450> flight<00:05:48.780> test<00:05:49.080> build<00:05:50.040> and<00:05:50.820> this<00:05:51.030> is

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
guys from flight test build and this is

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.200 
guys from flight test build and this is
made<00:05:51.480> out<00:05:51.630> of<00:05:51.660> those<00:05:51.960> plans<00:05:52.670> just<00:05:53.670> multiplied

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
made out of those plans just multiplied
