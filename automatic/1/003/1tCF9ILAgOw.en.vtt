check<00:00:24.250> out<00:00:24.400> my<00:00:24.520> neighbor's<00:00:24.880> lawn<00:00:25.060> over<00:00:25.270> there

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
check out my neighbor's lawn over there

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.740 
check out my neighbor's lawn over there
he<00:00:26.170> insists<00:00:27.010> on<00:00:27.100> mowing<00:00:27.670> it<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.150> low<00:00:28.390> that<00:00:28.420> it's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
he insists on mowing it so low that it's

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.660 
he insists on mowing it so low that it's
all<00:00:28.990> browned<00:00:29.320> out<00:00:29.560> so<00:00:30.100> if<00:00:30.220> you<00:00:30.340> leave<00:00:30.490> the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
all browned out so if you leave the

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.580 
all browned out so if you leave the
grass<00:00:30.880> tall<00:00:31.300> it<00:00:31.480> will<00:00:31.570> preserve<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:32.110> moisture

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
grass tall it will preserve the moisture

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.380 
grass tall it will preserve the moisture
and<00:00:32.739> keep<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.309> green<00:00:33.640> color<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.059> you're

and keep that green color that you're
looking<00:00:34.420> for<00:00:34.899> you<00:00:35.469> may<00:00:35.620> also<00:00:35.829> notice<00:00:36.399> that

looking for you may also notice that

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.579 
looking for you may also notice that
there's<00:00:36.700> a<00:00:36.760> lot<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:37.030> clover<00:00:37.449> on<00:00:37.600> this<00:00:38.289> lawn

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
there's a lot of clover on this lawn

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.200 
there's a lot of clover on this lawn
these<00:00:39.249> plants<00:00:39.640> right<00:00:39.699> here

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
these plants right here

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.419 
these plants right here
I've<00:00:40.870> actually<00:00:41.440> planted<00:00:41.829> them<00:00:41.949> there<00:00:42.219> on

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
I've actually planted them there on

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.090 
I've actually planted them there on
purpose<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.030> added<00:00:43.269> clover<00:00:43.870> seed<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.829> lawn

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
purpose I added clover seed to the lawn

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.950 
purpose I added clover seed to the lawn
seed<00:00:45.399> mix<00:00:45.670> when<00:00:45.820> I<00:00:45.909> planted<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.449> lawn

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
seed mix when I planted this lawn

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.410 
seed mix when I planted this lawn
clover<00:00:47.859> does<00:00:48.010> some<00:00:48.190> really<00:00:48.579> special<00:00:48.909> things

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
clover does some really special things

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.259 
clover does some really special things
it<00:00:49.839> traps<00:00:50.260> nitrogen<00:00:51.069> from<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.339> atmosphere<00:00:51.429> in

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
it traps nitrogen from the atmosphere in

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.970 
it traps nitrogen from the atmosphere in
its<00:00:53.050> own<00:00:53.260> roots

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
its own roots

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.189 
its own roots
so<00:00:54.460> therefore<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:55.149> soil<00:00:55.449> can<00:00:55.719> use<00:00:55.960> that

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
so therefore the soil can use that

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.469 
so therefore the soil can use that
nitrogen<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:57.190> grow<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.579> grass<00:00:57.760> plants

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
nitrogen to grow the grass plants

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.229 
nitrogen to grow the grass plants
it's<00:00:58.659> called<00:00:58.929> nitrogen<00:00:59.589> fixation<00:01:00.159> I'd<00:01:00.940> like

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
it's called nitrogen fixation I'd like

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's called nitrogen fixation I'd like
you<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.539> watch<00:01:01.719> something<00:01:02.350> right<00:01:02.649> now<00:01:02.829> by<00:01:03.010> my

is<00:01:11.890> dark<00:01:12.250> green<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.670> more<00:01:13.119> drought<00:01:13.570> resistant

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
is dark green and more drought resistant

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.800 
is dark green and more drought resistant
than<00:01:14.439> the<00:01:14.619> grass<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.340> if<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.180> look<00:01:16.390> very

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
than the grass and if you look very

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.170

closely<00:01:17.290> you<00:01:17.890> may<00:01:18.159> be<00:01:18.219> able<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.579> find<00:01:18.909> a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
closely you may be able to find a

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.709 
closely you may be able to find a
four-leaf<00:01:19.719> clover<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.710> we<00:01:21.340> all<00:01:21.549> know<00:01:21.909> what

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
four-leaf clover and we all know what

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.209 
four-leaf clover and we all know what
good<00:01:23.020> luck<00:01:23.289> they<00:01:23.710> are<00:01:24.630> bees<00:01:25.630> get<00:01:26.140> nectar<00:01:26.740> from

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
good luck they are bees get nectar from

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.179 
good luck they are bees get nectar from
the<00:01:27.340> white<00:01:27.549> flowers<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.659> we<00:01:29.439> in<00:01:29.619> turn<00:01:29.649> get

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
the white flowers and we in turn get

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.929 
the white flowers and we in turn get
pure<00:01:30.789> clover<00:01:31.509> honey<00:01:31.689> from<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.289> bees<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
pure clover honey from the bees but the

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.770 
pure clover honey from the bees but the
best<00:01:34.240> part<00:01:34.539> is<00:01:34.810> what's<00:01:35.530> underground<00:01:36.250> on<00:01:36.909> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
best part is what's underground on the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.649 
best part is what's underground on the
roots<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.320> white<00:01:38.619> clover<00:01:38.979> are<00:01:39.369> little<00:01:40.030> nodules

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
roots of white clover are little nodules

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.060 
roots of white clover are little nodules
