there I needed to keep them because they

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.760 
there I needed to keep them because they
were<00:00:34.270> really<00:00:34.600> useful<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:35.110> block<00:00:35.290> out<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.470> Sun

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
were really useful to block out the Sun

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.590 
were really useful to block out the Sun
in<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> afternoon<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:36.850> I<00:00:36.879> hung<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> curtain

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
in the afternoon so I hung a curtain

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.270 
in the afternoon so I hung a curtain
panel<00:00:37.960> in<00:00:38.140> front<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.590> blinds<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:39.100> hide

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
panel in front of the blinds to hide

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.250 
panel in front of the blinds to hide
them<00:00:39.519> when<00:00:39.699> they're<00:00:39.850> not<00:00:39.879> being<00:00:40.210> used<00:00:40.300> I<00:00:40.870> ended

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
them when they're not being used I ended

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.990 
them when they're not being used I ended
up<00:00:41.350> using<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.980> curtain<00:00:42.280> panel<00:00:42.580> that<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.760> already

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
up using a curtain panel that I already

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.960 
up using a curtain panel that I already
had<00:00:43.360> from<00:00:43.570> Ikea<00:00:44.080> but<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:44.920> had<00:00:45.100> tabs<00:00:45.400> which<00:00:45.790> were

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
had from Ikea but it had tabs which were

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.880 
had from Ikea but it had tabs which were
going<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.239> show<00:00:46.360> below<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.989> plastic<00:00:47.440> cornice

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
going to show below the plastic cornice

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.130 
going to show below the plastic cornice
so<00:00:48.190> an<00:00:48.309> easy<00:00:48.489> fix<00:00:48.879> was<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.269> pin<00:00:49.510> them<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.960> make

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
so an easy fix was to pin them to make

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.160 
so an easy fix was to pin them to make
the<00:00:50.290> curtains<00:00:50.589> hang<00:00:50.830> higher<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.839> slid<00:00:53.140> a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
the curtains hang higher then I slid a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.869 
the curtains hang higher then I slid a
quarter<00:00:53.559> inch<00:00:53.680> wood<00:00:53.950> dowel<00:00:54.190> through<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.610> tabs

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
quarter inch wood dowel through the tabs

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.850 
quarter inch wood dowel through the tabs
and<00:00:55.180> hung<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.750> dowel<00:00:55.930> from<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.469> cornice

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
and hung the dowel from the cornice

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.740 
and hung the dowel from the cornice
brackets<00:00:57.370> tucking<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.120> tabs<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.629> they

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
brackets tucking in the tabs so they

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.750 
brackets tucking in the tabs so they
don't<00:00:58.960> show<00:00:59.199> from<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.530> front<00:00:59.770> now<00:01:00.309> I<00:01:00.340> can<00:01:00.579> open

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
don't show from the front now I can open

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.000 
don't show from the front now I can open
and<00:01:01.090> close<00:01:01.120> my<00:01:01.420> blinds<00:01:01.719> easily<00:01:02.379> but<00:01:02.590> I<00:01:02.620> don't

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
and close my blinds easily but I don't

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.469 
and close my blinds easily but I don't
have<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.370> look<00:01:03.520> at<00:01:03.670> them<00:01:03.789> when<00:01:03.910> I'm<00:01:04.059> not<00:01:04.210> using

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
have to look at them when I'm not using

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.400 
have to look at them when I'm not using
them<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:06.460> for<00:01:06.520> my<00:01:06.789> entryway<00:01:07.210> window<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:08.110> didn't
