00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.370
 and this is the story of a man 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.510
 current that wrote stories about 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 Extraordinary people 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.130
 one morning his muse left him on the way 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 along the shore and into the waves 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.210
 it became yes 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.970
 then the imagination of the writer 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.970
 He dried and was not able to dream again 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.789
 chasing the woman he went into 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.880
 the depths through a gap of 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.590
 earth and the mysterious and warm sea will 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.640
 he wrapped whispering words that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640
 They caressed their year 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.690
 good 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 I travel under the waters and although I searched 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.900
 found still in some however of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.900
 his head began to sprout ideas 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.149
 everything was down there from 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 always waiting to be discovered as 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.990
 a coveted treasure 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.000
 the creatures of the reef danced 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
 colorful dances for days but the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.940
 man was alone in the vastness 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.870
 silent so I imagine a friend someone 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.300
 current as he with whom he talks 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.030
 when he looked back he saw that in front 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.550
 from his eyes from the sand had arisen a 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.220
 imposing stone man approached 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.470
 contemplate it then the appeared charged 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 life and spoke that man out of his 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.160
 imagination was called manuel and it was 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.200
 lobster fisherman 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.630
 he soon realized that in that world 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.300
 submerged the ideas materialized 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.370
 just want it so he invented things 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.840
 that sprouted before his eyes even more 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.790
 radiant of what he had 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.579
 imagined 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.980
 but above all he thought people who 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.810
 lives of being listened to told him the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 details of their ordinary lives 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.060
 he soon had a whole army of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.689
 characters of pieces whispering their 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.040
 names their kinships their longings their 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:59.640
 dreams his eyes his passions his 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 stories 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.810
 There were so many data that the writer 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.409
 decided to take note of everything for 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.030
 do not forget and for hundreds of nights 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.540
 wrote everything that suggested those 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.540
 maids 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.920
 I pass the time while the writer 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.100
 he wove the lives of those mysterious 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.100
 characters 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.460
 after a few months the creatures 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.470
 submarines colonized their bodies 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.670
 stone in a hug that would bind them to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.670
 reef forever 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.180
 soon the arms of the woman who 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.170
 rose from the nap were 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.970
 seaweed cutlery 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.420
 while the fish played with their 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.420
 around 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.750
 the faces of the worried man and the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.050
 child who looks at the moon were filled with 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.050
 coral 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.940
 the objects were also home to 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.600
 tiny beings advancing 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.270
 slowly and the pregnant woman's feet and 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.520
 of the philosopher were attached to the bed 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.770
 Marine 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.900
 That was when the writer was given 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.750
 mind that his work would be buried 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.270
 in a short time but when he tried to take out 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.500
 everything from there your own body 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.539
 He already belonged to the sea and his heart 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.810
 turned into stone throbbed to the rhythm of 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.810
 waves 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.550
 and that man now extraordinary 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.970
 he kept writing stories about people 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.970
 current 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.940
 nobody knew his submerged world or read 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.490
 never one of his stories but each 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.520
 once you write one a new reef 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.030
 emerge in the ocean 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.030
 do not
