00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.570 

I<00:03:22.500> wish<00:03:23.500> my<00:03:23.620> mom<00:03:23.769> had<00:03:23.830> taken<00:03:24.040> me<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.370> check

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
I wish my mom had taken me the check

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.470 
I wish my mom had taken me the check
when<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:24.970> 10

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
when I was 10

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.780 
when I was 10
you<00:03:25.989> can't<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.349> world<00:03:26.560> champion<00:03:26.799> now<00:03:27.250> can<00:03:27.760> i

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
you can't be a world champion now can i

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.640 
you can't be a world champion now can i
right

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.289 

the<00:03:30.739> approach<00:03:30.980> speed<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.459> turning<00:03:31.849> point<00:03:32.120> for

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the approach speed and turning point for

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.110 
the approach speed and turning point for
both<00:03:32.540> lighters<00:03:33.049> is<00:03:33.200> very<00:03:33.470> similar<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.879> what

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
both lighters is very similar so what

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.000 
both lighters is very similar so what
was<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.450> key<00:03:35.659> difference<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.290> got<00:03:36.439> this<00:03:36.709> one

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
was the key difference that got this one

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.839 
was the key difference that got this one
through<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.670> put<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.360> one<00:03:38.599> in<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.019> dirt

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
through and put this one in the dirt

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.140 
through and put this one in the dirt
let's<00:03:40.849> look<00:03:41.090> again<00:03:41.209> at<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:43.220> lazy<00:03:43.519> steering

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
let's look again at this lazy steering

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.059 
let's look again at this lazy steering
rate<00:03:44.299> even<00:03:44.810> if<00:03:45.079> you<00:03:45.200> lead<00:03:45.409> it<00:03:45.500> over<00:03:45.769> further

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
rate even if you lead it over further

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.190 
rate even if you lead it over further
the<00:03:46.549> results<00:03:47.000> would<00:03:47.150> have<00:03:47.180> been<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.659> same<00:03:47.900> or

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
the results would have been the same or

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.580 
the results would have been the same or
worse<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:50.269> simple<00:03:50.659> solution<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.200> flicking

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
worse the simple solution is flicking

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.369 
worse the simple solution is flicking
the<00:03:51.709> bike<00:03:51.859> quick<00:03:52.159> enough<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.430> make<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.879> line

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
the bike quick enough to make the line

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.839 
the bike quick enough to make the line
now<00:03:54.379> what<00:03:54.680> will<00:03:54.859> happen<00:03:54.890> when<00:03:55.310> they<00:03:55.430> increase

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
now what will happen when they increase

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.920 
now what will happen when they increase
their<00:03:56.120> turn<00:03:56.359> entry<00:03:56.780> speed

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.710 

his<00:04:00.560> results<00:04:01.010> would<00:04:01.189> just<00:04:01.400> get<00:04:01.579> worse

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
his results would just get worse

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.180 
his results would just get worse
with<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> higher<00:04:04.989> entry<00:04:05.380> speed<00:04:05.650> than<00:04:05.830> before

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
with a higher entry speed than before

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.000 
with a higher entry speed than before
this<00:04:06.790> rider<00:04:07.120> still<00:04:07.720> makes<00:04:07.959> his<00:04:08.140> line<00:04:08.349> it's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
this rider still makes his line it's

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.089 
this rider still makes his line it's
quite<00:04:09.250> simple<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.970> terms<00:04:10.180> like<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:11.110> as<00:04:11.440> the

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
quite simple in terms like this as the

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.979 
quite simple in terms like this as the
speed<00:04:12.340> increases<00:04:12.569> so<00:04:13.569> must<00:04:13.870> your<00:04:14.110> flick<00:04:14.440> rate

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
speed increases so must your flick rate

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.750 
speed increases so must your flick rate
