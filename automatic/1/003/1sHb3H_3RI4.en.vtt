to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.910> there's<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.600> really<00:02:21.870> thin<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.380> don't

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
to do there's a really thin that don't

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.940 
to do there's a really thin that don't
need<00:02:22.710> very<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.190> glue<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.680> tape

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
need very much glue so I have my tape

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.050 
need very much glue so I have my tape
and<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.220> wind<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.060> around<00:02:30.710> like<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.160> this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and I just wind it around like so this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.240 
and I just wind it around like so this
gives<00:02:33.330> me<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:34.110> thin<00:02:34.410> line<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.950> apply

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
gives me a really thin line to apply

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.420 
gives me a really thin line to apply
glue<00:02:35.930> now<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.350> little<00:02:37.560> too<00:02:37.860> thin<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
glue now if it's a little too thin and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
glue now if it's a little too thin and
take<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.120> scissors<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.780> cut<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.620> a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
take your scissors and just cut just a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.230 
take your scissors and just cut just a
tiny<00:02:41.040> bit<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.400> off<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.000> still

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
tiny bit of that off because we still

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.380 
tiny bit of that off because we still
want<00:02:46.520> first<00:02:47.520> thing<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.150> put

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
want first thing I'm going to do is put

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.870 
want first thing I'm going to do is put
right<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.870> line<00:02:49.130> my<00:02:50.130> line<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.790> glue<00:02:55.880> see

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
right on this line my line of glue see

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:07.490 
right on this line my line of glue see
how<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.150> gives<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.840> cool<00:02:57.870> line

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.050 

then<00:03:08.500> we're<00:03:08.740> gonna<00:03:08.830> go<00:03:09.040> all<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.280> way<00:03:09.490> here<00:03:09.820> now

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
then we're gonna go all the way here now

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.140 
then we're gonna go all the way here now
I<00:03:10.090> did<00:03:10.390> pre<00:03:10.660> measure<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.170> chain<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:12.150> I've

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
I did pre measure this chain and I've

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.580 
I did pre measure this chain and I've
actually<00:03:13.510> found<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.020> chain<00:03:14.320> at<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
actually found this chain at the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.730 
actually found this chain at the
hardware<00:03:15.130> store<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:17.320> gonna<00:03:17.440> put<00:03:17.710> that

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
hardware store and I'm gonna put that

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.360 
hardware store and I'm gonna put that
right<00:03:18.160> into<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.790> blue<00:03:19.300> line<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:21.070> glue<00:03:21.250> is

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
right into that blue line the glue is

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.390 
right into that blue line the glue is
going<00:03:21.490> to<00:03:21.550> dry<00:03:21.610> completely<00:03:21.970> clear<00:03:22.600> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:24.310> I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
going to dry completely clear I think I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.990 
going to dry completely clear I think I
want<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.640> cut<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.000> little<00:03:25.210> bit<00:03:31.140> like<00:03:32.140> so

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
want to cut that a little bit like so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.820 
want to cut that a little bit like so
now<00:03:34.000> we're<00:03:34.510> gonna<00:03:34.630> start<00:03:34.960> gluing<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> rest<00:03:35.710> of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
now we're gonna start gluing the rest of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.590 
now we're gonna start gluing the rest of
our<00:03:35.920> things<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.670> time<00:03:36.910> i'm<00:03:37.120> using<00:03:37.300> the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
our things and this time i'm using the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.200 
our things and this time i'm using the
aleene's<00:03:37.650> super<00:03:38.650> thick<00:03:38.830> tacky<00:03:39.070> glue<00:03:39.490> it's

aleene's super thick tacky glue it's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.870 
aleene's super thick tacky glue it's
really<00:03:41.050> perfect<00:03:41.320> for<00:03:41.560> hard<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.190> hold<00:03:42.340> items

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880

and I poured a little bit out on my
tabletop<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.460> is<00:03:48.580> gonna<00:03:48.760> be<00:03:48.910> my<00:03:49.290> tires

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.860

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
now on this one I'm not worried about my

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.580 
now on this one I'm not worried about my
my<00:03:56.530> actual<00:03:57.010> line<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:59.020> I'm<00:03:59.140> gonna<00:03:59.230> because<00:03:59.470> I'm

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
my actual line so I'm gonna because I'm

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.720 
my actual line so I'm gonna because I'm
putting<00:03:59.740> it<00:03:59.950> right<00:03:59.980> over<00:04:00.130> there<00:04:00.490> but<00:04:00.640> I'll

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730

show you in just a second where you need
to<00:04:02.680> erase<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.160> line<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:04.210> just<00:04:04.240> start

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
to erase the line and just start

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.920 
to erase the line and just start
stacking<00:04:05.650> things<00:04:05.800> on<00:04:06.040> top<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.430> each<00:04:06.490> other

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.100 

like<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:13.180> find<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.630> found<00:04:13.930> this

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
like so and just find I found this

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.560 
like so and just find I found this
really<00:04:14.320> cool<00:04:14.650> piece<00:04:15.610> I<00:04:15.820> actually<00:04:15.970> had<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.420> my

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
really cool piece I actually had in my

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.010 
really cool piece I actually had in my
studio<00:04:16.960> that<00:04:17.260> um<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:19.450> was<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:19.720> little

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
studio that um it was like a little

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.479 
studio that um it was like a little
frame<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> thought<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:20.950> was<00:04:21.070> great<00:04:21.190> for<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
frame I thought it was great for the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.000 
frame I thought it was great for the
windows<00:04:21.820> also<00:04:22.060> I've<00:04:22.540> found<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.530> netting

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
windows also I've found this netting

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.080 
windows also I've found this netting
that<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.760> was<00:04:24.970> perfect<00:04:25.750> for<00:04:26.410> putting<00:04:27.100> on<00:04:27.460> the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
that it was perfect for putting on the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.700 
that it was perfect for putting on the
window<00:04:28.420> because<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.870> know<00:04:28.960> those<00:04:29.140> Nascars

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
window because you know those Nascars

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.350 
window because you know those Nascars
have<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.070> little<00:04:30.310> netting<00:04:30.760> at<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.000> window

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
have that little netting at the window

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.240 
have that little netting at the window
and<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:34.120> this<00:04:34.270> was<00:04:34.480> gonna<00:04:34.660> glue<00:04:34.900> right<00:04:35.080> there

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
and then this was gonna glue right there

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.120 
and then this was gonna glue right there
now<00:04:36.250> if<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.580> wanted<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> glue<00:04:37.300> something<00:04:38.130> see

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
now if I wanted to glue something see

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.350 
now if I wanted to glue something see
really<00:04:39.790> quick<00:04:40.030> have<00:04:40.900> these<00:04:41.050> things<00:04:41.320> here<00:04:41.680> I

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
really quick have these things here I
