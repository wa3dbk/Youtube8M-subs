00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 the situation between rodrigues and us 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 warendorf's at first sight 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.790
 you can not see anything and then 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 comes the slow motion which gets some 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.219
 wolf you say neutral 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.760
 position videos have got down on 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.939
 the foot year so I would again 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.449
 to agree with is elfmeter than the first 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.650
 scene then but that's stupid for big ones 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 Rooms can be slow and evil now 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 Ghosts believe because the noses as teeth 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.260
 with the final whistle, too 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.430
 would have eleven meters where you would have 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.410
 can give eleven meters 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 Three may but does not have decisions 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.649
 three times against the bvb i wanted this one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 but it brings more should take off 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.640
 and forwards a bit more 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 or an idea i hate to lose 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.440
 he will make the defeat so firm 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.109
 then it is completely wrong because 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.399
 that also work up chronologically 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.870
 Of course, the bvb can eventually 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.400
 but if you do it, you do it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.840
 has the watch the game we had 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.470
 even before 1 or 2 0 in leadership 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 can go 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.299
 that's a bit short so far 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.299
 come 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.320
 in a round even friends said 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.829
 No, that was me they had 20 drive 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.840
 I could say she agrees 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.179
 applause correctly yes I take everything 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 back 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:34.560
 Sunday morning under some strokes 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 that the penalty decision 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 could have been hit the other way 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.140
 and that jürgen klop the trainer of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.229
 bvb at the press conference 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.909
 of course , but has expressed very much 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.470
 Nobel 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.670
 Mr Drews has my name earlier than you 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.140
 Coach was a lot of friendly games 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.700
 Whistled by us because he was ours 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
 Therefore, he was not allowed to whistle the Bundesliga 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.259
 comes from directly against and I know 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 what ever since points behind more 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.670
 it probably was already there 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.130
 then certainly not work on the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.400
 decisions they would have thought that 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.349
 Your trainer can take back so 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.140
 the wild jury that is not the right one now 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.030
 you have to be careful now that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.940
 The jürgen klop not always 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.489
 tries in the poetic two games 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.440
 we do not give totally great 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.810
 Coach also a great guy though 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.100
 yesterday also in the first foul of 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.780
 bender, he jumps as if from the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.400
 Tarantula stung on front at 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.420
 fourth league card for manni that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.609
 happens before 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.139
 but it is only wrong now 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.030
 on jürgen klopp and jürgen klopp too 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.060
 look that makes every coach you times 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.609
 As a trainer you are under massive pressure 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.380
 and that comfort and I think that 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:51.870
 He was doing very well there yesterday 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.910
 expressed and the youth office also has a lot 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 much praise comes from walter states as we 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.930
 us in the round sits in one today 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 column in the picture on sunday next what 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.599
 has integrated into it, I have to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.099
 admit we had with another 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.380
 We already had reactions 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.669
 dreamed of headlines klop raging 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.669
 something is raging 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.800
 yes, always very grateful 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.690
 No I found it in the moment you notice 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.670
 yes interview with the colleagues of 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.620
 scale with the words and rank 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.500
 finally fought for and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.630
 a review but a soft criticism and 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.310
 regular review decided 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.430
 that was it, I think I'm smart 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.420
 and I do not know if he is now 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.040
 has changed or if the uefa lock him 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.210
 but has taken a bit deeper and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.490
 remembers a bit back there 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.540
 At least one had the impression 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.430
 he was a bit 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.090
 withdrawn so reserved 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.610
 that yours on the drawer is waiting for many 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.250
 drawers 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.020
 somehow it is this again 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.600
 clash of jürgen klopp until 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.520
 referee drees after the game 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.070
 Yesterday we also look at the pictures 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.709
 It was then very withdrawn 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.180
 went to push the impartial 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.290
 for a player on the side of himself 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.800
 got excited and then the great list 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.230
 then he passes the rotary hand 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.840
 and that was the first thing for 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.260
 The TV cameras are doing so far 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.760
 Well 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.550
 You really have to go to the background 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.050
 Mr. Drews also knows the man of 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.210
 in the last match the goal of dortmund 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.430
 against hope home had to give first 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.320
 had then withdrawn was all 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.380
 By the way, recording is correct 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.750
 but not descended and the same after 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.419
 Dreesch is also the man of five 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.310
 years a game hsv against dortmund 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 whistle was on the pictures 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.570
 already one comes to play 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.460
 duplicity of events also there the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.460
 for your club immediately become drews 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.979
 and then 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.169
 but then without a hard blow away and what 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.810
 at that time, the episode was already in memory 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.030
 At that time, Jürgen Klopp received 12,000 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.220
 euro fine for the number of 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.220
 also learned it sparingly 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.730
 Youth already pays his own punishment 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.480
 but is schwabe and from 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.070
 therefore a bit economical 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.110
 quite defensive and set 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.730
 therefore a good thing and he has 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.980
 maybe yesterday but no 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.450
 I also think he has seen overall 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.740
 of course, that can not be over 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.510
 Compare five years ago today 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.400
 a very different radiance yes there 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.310
 hardly anyone does not admire him for it 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.020
 who can stand that if something hype around 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.660
 him and happens even if he completely 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.250
 the normal everyday scenes has the 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.140
 can no longer live a normal life and 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:59.360
 that's what you would be for 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.360
 had to somehow assess whether the 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.980
 Yesterday, very much to take back 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.030
 respond as he has responded, we 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.140
 do not even know what he is to schiri 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.140
 I said wait first 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.530
 pleasing is not to say but me 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.730
 I think it's overdone even before five 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.990
 years this story if you then 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.090
 after the game to shoot there goes 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.470
 and tell him something I appeal 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.060
 again this communication 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.990
 between players and trainers 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.700
 It's easy for referees to do this 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.470
 improvement that happens 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.760
 just yelling in the moment yesterday 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.160
 i also believe its players easy 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.440
 he wants to protect the blanket he has brought 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.090
 also said afterwards and he should 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:40.729
 Just kid off the kid something 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:42.140
 do not assume he was doing something yesterday 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.550
 said but that's part of how but 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.070
 said also that is so after 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.140
 play and knows none of us what 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.250
 both because brat beat or 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.610
 not even when he says you are one 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.169
 blind you have a bad whistle yes 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.910
 it is noticeable that again and again 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:00.229
 clash of Mr. Drews with 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.780
 borussia dortmund is wants the dfb 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.580
 continue to make a little supplies 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.169
 rather if we do that we have nothing 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.870
 but we would not do it 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.070
 no, that's not to be ok 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.530
 they would not have surrendered if that 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.840
 dfb at the beginning now on it 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.990
 pay attention to other games 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.580
 Prince Jochen Drees also under pressure though 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.470
 he now the next game in the foreseeable future 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.240
 time of the bvb celebrated he had the same 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.090
 problem that all with argusaugen again 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.250
 So I'm assuming 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.750
 maybe that too from the dfb 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.639
 since I am a bit diplomatic 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:34.380
 handles and while we have against the 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.380
 persons drews there is no code
