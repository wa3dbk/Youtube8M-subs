for<00:00:10.300> this<00:00:10.510> stitch<00:00:10.870> work<00:00:11.350> on<00:00:11.620> any<00:00:12.010> multiple<00:00:12.610> of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
for this stitch work on any multiple of

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.750 
for this stitch work on any multiple of
two<00:00:13.180> and<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:14.260> pattern<00:00:14.590> also<00:00:14.800> suggests<00:00:15.610> adding

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
two and the pattern also suggests adding

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.660 
two and the pattern also suggests adding
one<00:00:16.150> stitch<00:00:16.450> on<00:00:16.660> each<00:00:17.020> end<00:00:17.380> for<00:00:17.619> salvage<00:00:18.430> and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
one stitch on each end for salvage and

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.000 
one stitch on each end for salvage and
I've<00:00:18.850> done<00:00:19.060> that<00:00:19.180> here<00:00:19.240> as<00:00:19.660> you<00:00:20.410> can<00:00:20.439> see<00:00:20.830> the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
I've done that here as you can see the

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.519 
I've done that here as you can see the
edges<00:00:21.220> are<00:00:21.580> still<00:00:21.970> pretty<00:00:22.720> sloppy<00:00:23.110> so

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
edges are still pretty sloppy so

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.080 
edges are still pretty sloppy so
depending<00:00:24.040> on<00:00:24.130> what<00:00:24.279> I<00:00:24.340> was<00:00:24.520> making<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.060> would

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
depending on what I was making I would

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.390 
depending on what I was making I would
definitely<00:00:25.689> add<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.869> more<00:00:26.200> substantial<00:00:26.950> border

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
definitely add a more substantial border

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.350

see<00:00:31.599> and<00:00:31.869> it's<00:00:32.470> just<00:00:32.710> repeating<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.460> same<00:00:33.700> row

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
see and it's just repeating the same row

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.220

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.270 

and<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.840> would<00:02:25.990> do<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:29.280> each

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
and that is what you would do for each

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.460 
and that is what you would do for each
side<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.480> fabric<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.320> this

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
side of the fabric and I think this

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.930 
side of the fabric and I think this
would<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> really<00:02:36.040> nice<00:02:36.220> stitch<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:36.820> you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
would be a really nice stitch if you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.930 
would be a really nice stitch if you
wanted<00:02:37.240> like<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.420> springy<00:02:38.050> or<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:39.090> summer<00:02:40.090> scarf

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
wanted like a springy or a summer scarf

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.690 
wanted like a springy or a summer scarf
it's<00:02:42.940> nice<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.420> lacy<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:47.130> at<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> end<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
it's nice and lacy and at the end of the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's nice and lacy and at the end of the
row<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.150> knit<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.840> edge<00:02:49.930> stitch<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:55.170> that
