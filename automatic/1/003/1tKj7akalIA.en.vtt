okay<00:00:00.960> today<00:00:01.290> we'll<00:00:01.800> be<00:00:01.979> changing<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.639> spark

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay today we'll be changing the spark

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.039 
okay today we'll be changing the spark
plugs<00:00:03.179> on<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.680> 2005<00:00:04.680> Dodge<00:00:05.279> Neon<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.990> want<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
plugs on a 2005 Dodge Neon I want to

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.680 
plugs on a 2005 Dodge Neon I want to
simplify<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.560> for<00:00:08.250> everyday<00:00:08.700> man<00:00:09.030> because<00:00:09.360> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
simplify it for everyday man because I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.450 
simplify it for everyday man because I
am<00:00:09.809> an<00:00:09.929> everyday<00:00:10.139> man<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.190> don't<00:00:11.250> know<00:00:11.429> all

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
am an everyday man and I don't know all

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.459 
am an everyday man and I don't know all
the<00:00:11.670> terms<00:00:11.880> but<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.360> know<00:00:12.480> what<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> know

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the terms but you know what now I know

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.790 
the terms but you know what now I know
not<00:00:13.740> spend<00:00:14.099> over<00:00:14.190> $100<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> tune-up<00:00:15.800> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
not spend over $100 on a tune-up the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
not spend over $100 on a tune-up the
first<00:00:17.070> thing<00:00:17.220> we're<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:18.420> take

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
first thing we're going to do is take

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.130 
first thing we're going to do is take
off<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.260> cap<00:00:20.539> when<00:00:21.539> we're<00:00:21.689> taking<00:00:21.810> off<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
off the cap when we're taking off the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.509 
off the cap when we're taking off the
caps<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.560> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.100> by<00:00:23.279> one

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
caps we want to do them one by one

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.420 
caps we want to do them one by one
because<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.720> got<00:00:24.869> mixed<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
because we don't got mixed up on the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.359 
because we don't got mixed up on the
Dodge<00:00:27.119> Neon<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> numbered<00:00:29.250> up

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
Dodge Neon it actually has a numbered up

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.770 
Dodge Neon it actually has a numbered up
here<00:00:29.580> 1<00:00:30.090> 2<00:00:30.480> 3<00:00:30.929> 4<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.149> it'll<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.239> easier<00:00:33.480> seed

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
here 1 2 3 4 and it'll be easier seed

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.889 
here 1 2 3 4 and it'll be easier seed
for<00:00:34.110> yourself<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> start

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
for yourself that I'm going to start

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
for yourself that I'm going to start
with<00:00:36.989> 1<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> easiest<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> take<00:00:39.600> off

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
with 1 so the easiest way to take off

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.119 
with 1 so the easiest way to take off
this<00:00:39.930> cap<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:42.590> pull<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> from<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
this cap is to pull it from the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
this cap is to pull it from the
distributor<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.559> then<00:00:47.809> pull<00:00:48.809> twist<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
distributor and then pull twist and it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.880 
distributor and then pull twist and it
come<00:00:51.629> out

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 

it<00:00:56.550> takes<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.239> muscle<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:57.840> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it takes a little bit muscle but it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
it takes a little bit muscle but it's
not<00:00:58.110> too<00:00:58.320> hard<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.520> need

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
not too hard and you really don't need

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
not too hard and you really don't need
any<00:00:59.850> tools<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.110> don't<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.440> buy<00:01:01.590> any

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
any tools for it so don't go buy any

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.420 
any tools for it so don't go buy any
tools<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.780> next<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:03.870> gonna<00:01:03.960> take<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> wrench

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
tools for next we're gonna take a wrench

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.660 
tools for next we're gonna take a wrench
just<00:01:05.430> stick<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> inside<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.330> engine<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.670> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just stick it inside the engine and it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.410 
just stick it inside the engine and it
you'll<00:01:09.270> find<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:10.640> size<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.060> your

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you'll find the right size for your

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.370 
you'll find the right size for your
spark<00:01:12.690> plug<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.729> go<00:01:14.729> left<00:01:15.560> pull<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.830> Oh

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.090 

easy<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.550> get<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> spark<00:01:24.030> plug<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
easy way to get the spark plug out is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.420 
easy way to get the spark plug out is
actually<00:01:26.100> used<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.420> cover<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.860> stick<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.310> back

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
actually used the cover so stick it back

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:43.810 
actually used the cover so stick it back
in

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.990 

Oh<00:01:43.850> -<00:01:44.390> easier<00:01:45.020> way

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.540 

let's<00:01:52.480> try<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.780> again<00:01:53.040> might<00:01:54.040> not<00:01:54.190> be<00:01:54.340> all<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
let's try it again might not be all the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:08.949 
let's try it again might not be all the
way<00:01:54.640> lease<00:02:01.620> sign<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.770> up<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.390> go

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.580 

and<00:02:09.109> if<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:11.030> want<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.329> loosen<00:02:11.930> up<00:02:12.109> at<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.439> end

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and if you want to loosen up at the end

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.990 
and if you want to loosen up at the end
you<00:02:13.489> can<00:02:13.609> also<00:02:13.700> turn<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.269> way<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.790> this

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
you can also turn it this way but this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.750 
you can also turn it this way but this
is<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.329> easier<00:02:17.629> way<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.989> get<00:02:18.200> out<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:19.489> spark

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
is the easier way to get out this spark

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.119 
is the easier way to get out this spark
plug<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.969> actually<00:02:20.540> new<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.920> bought<00:02:22.099> it

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
plug is actually new I just bought it

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.660 
plug is actually new I just bought it
from<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.430> store<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.290> replace<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.680> all<00:02:25.549> right

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
from the store I replace the all right

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.229 
from the store I replace the all right
took<00:02:25.849> out<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.209> four<00:02:26.450> previous<00:02:26.750> spark<00:02:27.139> plugs

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
took out the four previous spark plugs

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.140 
took out the four previous spark plugs
just<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.329> save<00:02:29.540> time<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:31.040> they're<00:02:31.340> real<00:02:31.760> dirty

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
just to save time but they're real dirty

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.809 
just to save time but they're real dirty
corroded<00:02:33.019> there's<00:02:33.680> rust<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.159> them<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.549> lot<00:02:34.700> of

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
corroded there's rust on them a lot of

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.330 
corroded there's rust on them a lot of
carbon<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.980> you're<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.159> want<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
carbon and you're going to want to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.110 
carbon and you're going to want to
change<00:02:37.430> them<00:02:37.639> out<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.430> save<00:02:43.639> time<00:02:43.849> I've

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
change them out so to save time I've

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.069 
change them out so to save time I've
already<00:02:44.299> taken<00:02:45.139> out<00:02:45.260> all<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.470> spark<00:02:45.919> plugs

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
already taken out all the spark plugs

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.210 
already taken out all the spark plugs
when<00:02:48.079> you're<00:02:48.200> replacing<00:02:48.470> your<00:02:48.739> spark<00:02:48.829> plug

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
when you're replacing your spark plug

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.789 
when you're replacing your spark plug
you<00:02:49.669> want<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.879> know<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> gauge<00:02:50.359> the<00:02:51.290> gauge<00:02:51.500> you

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
you want to know the gauge the gauge you

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.399 
you want to know the gauge the gauge you
can<00:02:51.829> actually<00:02:52.099> find<00:02:52.459> inside<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.150> hood<00:02:53.409> you'll

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
can actually find inside the hood you'll

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.199 
can actually find inside the hood you'll
see<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.709> next<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.099> your<00:02:55.219> VIN<00:02:55.879> number<00:02:56.180> and

everything<00:02:56.659> else<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.319> spark<00:02:57.739> plugs<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.540> gap

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
everything else a spark plugs the gap

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.580 
everything else a spark plugs the gap
that's<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.040> gap<00:03:01.340> you'll<00:03:01.519> need<00:03:02.349> you<00:03:03.349> can<00:03:03.469> also

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
that's the gap you'll need you can also

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.399 
that's the gap you'll need you can also
get<00:03:03.829> one<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.069> these<00:03:04.159> tools<00:03:05.139> they're<00:03:06.139> fairly

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
get one of these tools they're fairly

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.569 
get one of these tools they're fairly
cheap<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:08.389> you<00:03:08.659> just<00:03:08.840> find<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.799> number<00:03:10.099> this

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
cheap and you just find the number this

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.909 
cheap and you just find the number this
is<00:03:10.639> a<00:03:10.819> 3.5<00:03:11.709> our<00:03:12.709> spark<00:03:13.069> plug<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.709> put<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.829> in

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
is a 3.5 our spark plug so put it in

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.000 
is a 3.5 our spark plug so put it in
there<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:18.260> one<00:03:18.409> thing<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.829> look

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
there and the one thing you want to look

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.890 
there and the one thing you want to look
for<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.970> make<00:03:20.000> sure<00:03:20.209> it's<00:03:20.359> not<00:03:20.449> rattle

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
for is to make sure it's not rattle

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.439 
for is to make sure it's not rattle
around<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.379> sort<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.620> snug<00:03:22.000> let's<00:03:23.000> say<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.239> get

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
around and sort of snug let's say to get

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.780 
around and sort of snug let's say to get
uh<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:25.129> one<00:03:25.310> two<00:03:25.459> three<00:03:26.379> so<00:03:27.379> we<00:03:27.579> stick<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.669> in

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
uh this one two three so we stick it in

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.490 
uh this one two three so we stick it in
there<00:03:29.199> so<00:03:30.199> rattles<00:03:31.269> get<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.629> higher<00:03:32.989> one<00:03:33.290> you

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
there so rattles get like higher one you

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.490 
there so rattles get like higher one you
might<00:03:33.590> want<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.829> fit<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.669> four<00:03:35.500> won't

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
might want to fit in that's a four won't

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.319 
might want to fit in that's a four won't
fit<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.769> at<00:03:36.889> all<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.180> one<00:03:38.359> works<00:03:38.540> for<00:03:38.900> a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
fit in at all so this one works for a

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.339 
fit in at all so this one works for a
3.5<00:03:41.329> perfect

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.119 

so<00:03:44.980> when<00:03:45.400> you're<00:03:45.519> changing<00:03:45.939> it<00:03:46.799> we<00:03:47.799> can<00:03:47.980> use

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
so when you're changing it we can use

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.629 
so when you're changing it we can use
the<00:03:48.629> again<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.780> plug<00:03:52.950> also<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.430> want<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:54.579> make

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
the again the plug also you want to make

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.520 
the again the plug also you want to make
sure<00:03:54.849> you<00:03:54.969> have<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.269> washer<00:03:55.719> on<00:03:55.810> there<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.109> is

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
sure you have the washer on there it is

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.449

very<00:03:56.709> important<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.129> have<00:03:57.249> the<00:03:57.400> washer<00:03:58.409> so

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
very important to have the washer so

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.270 
very important to have the washer so
slide<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.609> back<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.879> with<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> plug<00:04:02.099> sign<00:04:03.099> it

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
slide it back in with the plug sign it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:17.360 
slide it back in with the plug sign it
up<00:04:03.430> go<00:04:04.359> right<00:04:04.599> go<00:04:05.439> towards<00:04:05.739> your<00:04:05.799> right<00:04:05.950> hand
