less than a minute and though it's going

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.820 
less than a minute and though it's going
to<00:01:55.610> hook<00:01:55.729> up<00:01:55.970> here<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:58.160> registration<00:01:58.850> wasn't

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
to hook up here the registration wasn't

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.800 
to hook up here the registration wasn't
perfect<00:02:00.830> so<00:02:01.490> that's<00:02:01.640> how<00:02:01.880> easy<00:02:01.910> it<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.570> to

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
perfect so that's how easy it is to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.510 
perfect so that's how easy it is to
actually<00:02:02.990> pair<00:02:03.470> up<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:03.740> Bluetooth<00:02:04.009> cell

the Bluetooth has been linked to the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.979 
the Bluetooth has been linked to the
vehicle<00:02:12.580> okay<00:02:13.580> hopefully<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.600> made<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.900> a

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
vehicle okay hopefully that made it a

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.100 
vehicle okay hopefully that made it a
lot<00:02:15.170> easier<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.860> people<00:02:16.489> with<00:02:16.790> droids<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
lot easier for people with droids and it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.710 
lot easier for people with droids and it
will<00:02:18.200> actually<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.770> used<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:19.790> iPhones<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.570> can

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
will actually be used on iPhones you can

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.310 
will actually be used on iPhones you can
use<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.989> on<00:02:21.110> iPhones<00:02:21.530> too<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:23.110> quickies<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
use it on iPhones too so quickies the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.740 
use it on iPhones too so quickies the
explanation<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.360> takes<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.450> lot<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.660> that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
explanation and takes a lot of that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.850 
explanation and takes a lot of that
difficulty<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.620> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
difficulty out of it
