00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.180 

so<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.250> look<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.149> side<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.809> boat

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
so if we look at the side of the boat

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.240 
so if we look at the side of the boat
you<00:00:38.190> could<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.239> seam<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
you could see we have a little seam of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.950 
you could see we have a little seam of
cracking<00:00:41.250> over<00:00:41.520> here

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.170 

okay<00:00:48.559> what<00:00:49.370> we're<00:00:49.520> going<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.700> do<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.030> we're

the<00:00:57.949> years<00:00:57.980> cracking<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.239> we're<00:00:59.360> going<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.540> use

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
the years cracking so we're going to use

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.680 
the years cracking so we're going to use
a<00:00:59.780> little<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.260> grinder<00:01:00.829> like<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:02.480> we're

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
a little a grinder like this and we're

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.790 
a little a grinder like this and we're
going<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:05.210> notch<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.690> out<00:01:05.810> ok<00:01:06.560> we're<00:01:06.710> going

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
going to to notch it out ok we're going

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.740 
going to to notch it out ok we're going
to<00:01:06.860> notch<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.369> out<00:01:07.490> put<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.759> little<00:01:07.940> v-notch<00:01:08.509> in

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
to notch it out put a little v-notch in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.350 
to notch it out put a little v-notch in
here<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.290> then<00:01:09.979> go<00:01:10.009> over<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.700> we're<00:01:11.180> going<00:01:11.300> to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
here and then go over it we're going to

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.710 
here and then go over it we're going to
send<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:12.950> whole<00:01:13.159> area<00:01:13.550> with<00:01:14.180> about<00:01:14.420> 80

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
send this this whole area with about 80

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.380 
send this this whole area with about 80
grit<00:01:15.190> then<00:01:16.190> we're<00:01:16.399> going<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.580> fill<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.180> with

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
grit then we're going to fill it in with

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.560 
grit then we're going to fill it in with
our<00:01:17.630> kitty<00:01:17.930> hair<00:01:18.229> putty<00:01:18.530> it's<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.830> fiberglass

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
our kitty hair putty it's a fiberglass

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.169 
our kitty hair putty it's a fiberglass
body<00:01:20.570> filler<00:01:21.020> mixture<00:01:21.560> that's<00:01:22.550> great<00:01:22.850> for

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
body filler mixture that's great for

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.480 
body filler mixture that's great for
marine<00:01:23.600> stuff<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.320> boats<00:01:24.649> and<00:01:24.860> fiberglass

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
marine stuff and boats and fiberglass

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.779 
marine stuff and boats and fiberglass
stuff<00:01:26.080> because<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.890> fiberglass<00:01:28.340> and

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
stuff because this is fiberglass and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.639 
stuff because this is fiberglass and
we're<00:01:29.000> going<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.149> fill<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.960> seam<00:01:30.200> around<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
we're going to fill the seam around the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.490 
we're going to fill the seam around the
whole<00:01:30.830> boat<00:01:31.270> sand<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.420> down<00:01:32.450> prime<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.170> get

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
whole boat sand it down prime it and get

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.669 
whole boat sand it down prime it and get
it<00:01:33.530> ready<00:01:33.710> for<00:01:33.860> paint<00:01:34.009> okay<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:36.500> just

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
it ready for paint okay so it's just

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.499 
it ready for paint okay so it's just
another<00:01:36.950> easy<00:01:37.250> way<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.610> fix<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.149> it's<00:01:38.390> a

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
another easy way to fix that it's a

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.480 
another easy way to fix that it's a
minor<00:01:38.780> problem<00:01:39.200> this<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.560> not<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> big<00:01:40.100> deal<00:01:40.280> at

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
minor problem this is not a big deal at

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.790 
minor problem this is not a big deal at
all<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:40.909> common<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.509> lot<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.869> boats<00:01:42.080> it

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
all this is common on a lot of boats it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.950 
all this is common on a lot of boats it
happens<00:01:43.220> over<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.640> years<00:01:43.940> they<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.450> because

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
happens over the years they just because

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.590 
happens over the years they just because
of<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.170> fiberglass<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.069> flexes<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.819> it<00:01:47.390> just

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
of the fiberglass it flexes and it just

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.850 
of the fiberglass it flexes and it just
cracks<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:50.060> can<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.630> some<00:01:51.080> scuff

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
the bottom of the hull doesn't look too

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.510 
the bottom of the hull doesn't look too
bad<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:06.259> has<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.770> all<00:02:06.920> be<00:02:06.950> sanded<00:02:07.640> down

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
to refill it and then when we're done
with<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.239> we're<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.109> put<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.350> rubber

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
with that we're going to put a rubber

with that we're going to put a rubber
molding<00:04:17.640> around<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.060> whole<00:04:18.270> side<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
molding around the whole side of the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.380 
molding around the whole side of the
boat<00:04:19.230> here<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:20.190> way<00:04:20.400> if<00:04:20.520> it<00:04:20.640> bumps<00:04:20.850> against<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
boat here this way if it bumps against a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.200 
boat here this way if it bumps against a
piece<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.630> wood<00:04:21.930> or<00:04:22.550> part<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.669> harbor<00:04:24.180> or

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
piece of wood or part of the harbor or

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.120 
piece of wood or part of the harbor or
anything<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:25.200> have<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> little<00:04:25.650> bit<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.860> cushion

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
anything we have a little bit of cushion

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.680 
anything we have a little bit of cushion
so<00:04:26.520> we're<00:04:26.640> going<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.820> get<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.940> thick<00:04:27.270> piece<00:04:27.480> of

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
so we're going to get a thick piece of

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.470 
so we're going to get a thick piece of
rubber<00:04:28.380> molding<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.040> put<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.150> all<00:04:30.330> around

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
across the front of the boat so it'll

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.820
