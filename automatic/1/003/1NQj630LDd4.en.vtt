00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
layers yeah I do that and then I go like

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.850 
layers yeah I do that and then I go like
on<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.820> top<00:02:13.090> or<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.390> bottom<00:02:13.510> whatever<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.709> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
on the top or the bottom whatever and I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
on the top or the bottom whatever and I
go<00:02:15.100> like<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:18.340> kind<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.209> probably<00:02:19.810> want

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
go like this you kind of probably want

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.120 
go like this you kind of probably want
to<00:02:19.959> do<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.200> tops<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> later<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
to do on the tops of you later on the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.690 
to do on the tops of you later on the
top<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.550> bottom<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.420> then<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
top in the bottom but then I do that and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.530 
top in the bottom but then I do that and
then<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.300> close<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.020> like<00:02:26.440> slowly<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.830> um<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
then I close it like slowly but um and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
then I close it like slowly but um and
that<00:02:31.570> creates<00:02:32.020> all<00:02:32.260> my<00:02:32.530> layers<00:02:32.860> um<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.790> guess

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
that creates all my layers um I guess

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.729 
that creates all my layers um I guess
that<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.150> really<00:02:34.450> really<00:02:34.720> short<00:02:35.110> ones<00:02:35.410> i

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
that have really really short ones i

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.990 
that have really really short ones i
