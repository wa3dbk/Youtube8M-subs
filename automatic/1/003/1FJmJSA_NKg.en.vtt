you<00:02:24.790> got<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.120> read<00:02:25.269> this<00:02:25.450> one<00:02:25.720> too<00:02:25.989> from<00:02:26.709> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
you got to read this one too from the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.009

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
first chapter that I've already read it

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.039 
first chapter that I've already read it
is<00:02:29.950> kind<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.700> different<00:02:31.000> from<00:02:31.480> Twilight

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
is kind of different from Twilight

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.650 
is kind of different from Twilight
obviously<00:02:32.830> because<00:02:33.010> not<00:02:33.940> from<00:02:34.239> Bella's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
obviously because not from Bella's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.250 
obviously because not from Bella's
perspective<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.799> from<00:02:36.040> free<00:02:36.370> who<00:02:37.209> was<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.840> girl

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
perspective is from free who was a girl

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.640 
perspective is from free who was a girl
in<00:02:38.470> eclipse<00:02:38.890> who<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:40.180> newborn<00:02:40.690> vampire<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:50.370 
in eclipse who is a newborn vampire and
I<00:02:42.610> think<00:02:42.910> she<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:45.340> made<00:02:45.730> by<00:02:48.450> she<00:02:49.450> was<00:02:49.599> made<00:02:49.840> by

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
I think she was made by she was made by

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.370 
I think she was made by she was made by
these<00:02:50.920> other<00:02:51.400> newborn<00:02:52.120> vampires<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.110> then
