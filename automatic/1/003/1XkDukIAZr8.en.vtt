you might want to add one or more of

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.430 
you might want to add one or more of
these<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> single<00:02:22.850> vessel<00:02:23.200> additionally<00:02:24.200> it

so<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:32.990> example<00:02:33.350> here<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.740> talked<00:02:33.980> about<00:02:34.010> some

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
so for example here we talked about some

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.510 
so for example here we talked about some
of<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.640> operation<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:36.080> MCU<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.220> can<00:02:37.370> see

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
of the operation of the MCU you can see

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.570 
of the operation of the MCU you can see
here<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.330> dedicated<00:02:39.020> home<00:02:39.230> key<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.520> I

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
here I have a dedicated home key so if I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.220 
here I have a dedicated home key so if I
press<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.300> can<00:02:41.480> actually<00:02:41.780> bring<00:02:41.960> up<00:02:42.110> the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
press that I can actually bring up the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
press that I can actually bring up the
home<00:02:42.410> display<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.550> cancel<00:02:44.030> button

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
home display and I have a cancel button

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.910 
home display and I have a cancel button
as<00:02:44.390> well<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.780> if<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.930> want<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.200> cancel<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.620> I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
as well so if I want to cancel that I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.070 
as well so if I want to cancel that I
can<00:02:46.100> bring<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> back<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.760> my<00:02:46.940> original<00:02:47.480> mode
