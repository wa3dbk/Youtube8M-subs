00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.430
 his sefyu world fight and today one 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.810
 is found for a small video a 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.639
 little bit special since today 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.340
 I will teach you how to install 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.660
 the lucky colored blocks so that's 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.070
 something that was a lot to me 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.900
 ask especially just after the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.400
 publishing my videos where I played 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.260
 precisely with lucky colored blocks 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.910
 especially in my fashion series is for 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.560
 the moment I played with the red block 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.289
 and white but I plan to do 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.830
 a few a few after so yeah 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.940
 that's pretty cool and the only thing 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.289
 is that in the comments you 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.640
 were many wanting to want 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.050
 know how does it get settled 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.489
 so is today I'm going to you 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.739
 learn how to do you'll see 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.450
 it's really very simple so in the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.120
 description i will put a little list 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.620
 with several lucky colored blocks that 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.079
 you can download with the link of 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.090
 download available and you 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.340
 can test yourself on your side 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.750
 so the lucky colorful blocks in addition to 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.149
 change the skin of the eye that blocks 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.559
 will change a little bit there your way 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.460
 to play with the places that blog 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.040
 since they will be added different 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.390
 bonuses different penalties and beat for that 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.100
 and for those who play a little bit like 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.539
 me a lot with the blues that blocks 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.490
 it allows a little bit of variation and 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.999
 golden to rediscover a little bit the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.509
 fashion 

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:11.709
 so when you download a lucky 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.869
 colored blocks you end up with 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.759
 an archive in just low vip points 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.209
 like that so in all archives 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.200
 in principle that you will get in 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.600
 downloading the lucky colored blocks 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.229
 you will have a lucky block properties 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 point txt and a lucky point png block 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.979
 so it's pretty simple to install 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.049
 then then me personally for 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.209
 to install the modes I use a 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.979
 little software called multi mcg 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.869
 already done a tutorial on how 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.399
 install modes with multi mc for 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.079
 those who wonder so I will you 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.219
 put that in the description but in 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.520
 big I'll show you how that 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.149
 market 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.529
 so basically you have you have some 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.479
 multiple instances so me my 

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.459
 instance with the mode of which blocks 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.079
 to install it this one at xxi cops 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.939
 are changed the moment what I'm going 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.189
 in resources during their fashion forgiveness 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.679
 I have this world called the example 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.239
 fashion but actually it's the blocking 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.889
 until I know why 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.859
 not the one blocking his record 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.959
 example fashion to and neck and blow it 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.610
 must have already first thing 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.830
 before you can install the lucky ones 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.600
 blocks of colors it's already having launched 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.850
 once his game with the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.230
 mode the little block to throw once 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.880
 that you did that you're going to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.550
 return to your case file 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.760
 so if you are on the launcher 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.320
 basic minecraft you will type in 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.800
 your in your start menu 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.400
 you're going to type grandpa data % 20% 1 pp 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.080
 data % you clicked on entry then 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 I have good it's good it's just it's 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.060
 slow up did it fast and grubby data % 20 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.640
 % 1 pp data% you're going to go in 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 point minecraft and you're going to have some 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.970
 files I want to talk to you about 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.410
 now right now so less here 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.030
 on melty mc i have to click on 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.420
 simply on this button the folder of 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.770
 the instance and I arrive in when I 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.910
 go in the folder minecraft I arrive 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.740
 in the folders that will interest 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.510
 so in the folder in which you 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.680
 are you using multi mc you 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.960
 click on instance folder 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.790
 minecraft either you have the launcher of 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.110
 base and you have installed forge on 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.750
 the basic nunchuk as well as the mode of 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.390
 that block this you go in % to grandpa 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.460
 data for 100 minecraft points and you 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.710
 do you normally have these files so you 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.550
 must have a config folder that we will 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.700
 immediately modified 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.220
 so you must have stronger forge 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.350
 young clouding you are going to go into the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.870
 lucky folder so the lucky folder 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.790
 it's the folder that contains all the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.380
 all to the configurations for 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.060
 your mode the blocking is all 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.520
 just what you're going to do is 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.140
 that you will replace the lucky block 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.870
 properties context and who is present 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.060
 in this in this folder by the lucky 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.750
 blog properties that is present in 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.180
 your archive 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.400
 so that's it was changed and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.070
 now when the game will start there 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.540
 will read this folder and it's okay 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.760
 add all the news 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.590
 all all the new penalties and all 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.120
 new bonuses so that's fine 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.560
 as well as new methods 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.300
 finally the new ways of kraft the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.920
 places that blocks but it's not over there 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.340
 will have to make a second small 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.620
 pattern 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.100
 you will go to the mods folder and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.570
 you should have your blocking 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.830
 jar point that should be here you 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.560
 does right click open with a rare and 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.720
 you will simply deleted the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.430
 folder put your inph that's it's done 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.970
 and you go to the helper to 7 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.210
 lucky texture blocks and you go 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.010
 delete the lucky draw finally the kinder 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.290
 score point png block you 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.060
 delete it and guess what are we going 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.800
 replace we will replace it with the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.200
 kinder what a block that is present 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.270
 in our other archives and we're going 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.160
 click on ok and now when 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.210
 launch the game normally it should 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.100
 working properly 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.080
 hop i 'm going to click play and 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.570
 watch you go see that will take 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.160
 a little bit of time to load because 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.420
 that again with forge it takes 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.600
 a lot of time a lot of time to 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.910
 load but possibly from here 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.250
 some few seconds it 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.690
 should be on the game i 'm going to click 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.160
 on single player I will create a 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.620
 new part really quickly 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.330
 to test with you I put in 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.840
 creative created with us criticize the 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.260
 world and we'll see if I loved new 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.000
 the blocking so if everything worked 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.990
 correctly your game should launch 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.560
 perfectly and and if we type the who 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.570
 blocked 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.910
 you see that melo that blocks his red 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.340
 and I have no way to test too much 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.920
 too much but we'll be able to test up torch 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.270
 you will see good I do not know I know 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.090
 that the places they will not block 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.320
 much different from two different 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.470
 lucky normal block of the shot maybe 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.430
 we will not see the difference 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.100
 if we see a little difference 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.270
 received there do not exist in places 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.490
 that blocks in the water but see that in 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.920
 big ben voila I have my new ones but 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.050
 new lucky luck and blocks that are in 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.450
 more red so that's cool 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.970
 that's how to install just about every 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.070
 types of lucky colorful blocks 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.900
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.120
 more and more importantly you will have been useful 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.500
 again in the description he 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.750
 are several lucky colorful blocks so 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.940
 you can go test like that yourself 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.050
 even from your side I hope that the weekly 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.350
 you will have pleased and I tell you to very
