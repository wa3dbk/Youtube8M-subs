of two things one come by the booth or I
hope<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> swung<00:00:58.620> by<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> booth<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.280> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
can look at me explaining what exactly

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.800 
can look at me explaining what exactly
it<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> device<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.210> thin<00:01:06.479> light

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it is it's a device that is thin light

so<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.400> see<00:02:14.640> over<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.570> on

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
so you can actually see over here on

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
so you can actually see over here on
this<00:02:16.050> side<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.160> pretty<00:02:17.490> much<00:02:17.730> entirely

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
this side that is pretty much entirely

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.050 
this side that is pretty much entirely
mesh<00:02:18.870> over<00:02:19.350> here<00:02:19.590> above<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.070> key<00:02:20.370> components

mesh over here above the key components

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.200 
mesh over here above the key components
so<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> CPU<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.020> actually<00:02:22.800> right<00:02:23.130> below<00:02:23.520> here

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
so the CPU is actually right below here

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.510 
so the CPU is actually right below here
and<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.350> come<00:02:25.530> around<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> back<00:02:26.280> here

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and if you come around to the back here

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.040 
and if you come around to the back here
you're<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> see<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> internal
