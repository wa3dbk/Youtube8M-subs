00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
sounded a bit snobby to put down what

sounded a bit snobby to put down what
other<00:06:01.130> people<00:06:01.520> do<00:06:02.270> as<00:06:02.690> their<00:06:03.020> life<00:06:03.410> choice<00:06:03.970> but

other people do as their life choice but
I<00:06:05.630> don't<00:06:06.530> care<00:06:06.740> because<00:06:06.920> it<00:06:07.190> really<00:06:07.430> annoys<00:06:07.580> me

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
I don't care because it really annoys me

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.460 
I don't care because it really annoys me
and<00:06:08.090> they<00:06:08.390> can<00:06:08.540> have<00:06:08.660> a<00:06:08.690> go<00:06:08.900> at<00:06:08.960> me<00:06:09.140> for<00:06:09.350> being

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
and they can have a go at me for being

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.280 
and they can have a go at me for being
science<00:06:09.950> and<00:06:10.100> that<00:06:10.190> if<00:06:10.340> they<00:06:10.460> really<00:06:10.670> want<00:06:11.290> but

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
science and that if they really want but

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.920 
science and that if they really want but
I<00:06:12.860> doubt<00:06:13.010> they<00:06:13.610> would<00:06:13.850> ever<00:06:14.000> see<00:06:14.270> this<00:06:14.450> because

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
I doubt they would ever see this because

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.140 
I doubt they would ever see this because
they're<00:06:15.110> too<00:06:15.260> busy<00:06:15.470> tracking<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.400> life<00:06:16.610> of
