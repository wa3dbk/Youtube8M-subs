00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.179 
seven oh seven this is actually EOC
anyway<00:00:24.410> um<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:27.320> basically<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.650> fastest<00:00:29.070> way

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
anyway um so basically the fastest way

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
anyway um so basically the fastest way
to<00:00:29.220> drop<00:00:29.519> things<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:31.759> to<00:00:32.759> use<00:00:32.790> mouse<00:00:33.180> keys<00:00:33.540> but

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to drop things is to use mouse keys but

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
to drop things is to use mouse keys but
if<00:00:34.290> you're<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.710> gonna<00:00:35.489> basically<00:00:35.760> destroy

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
if you're not gonna basically destroy
