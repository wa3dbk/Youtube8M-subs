00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the 1 chord and then we're going to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
the 1 chord and then we're going to
modulate<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.690> whole<00:00:42.899> step<00:00:42.930> into<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> key<00:00:43.829> of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.080 
modulate up a whole step into the key of
E<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.500> unusual<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:47.039> us<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> 5

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
into the next keen and what that means

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.090 
into the next keen and what that means
is<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:54.000> we're<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> key<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> D<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.680> final
