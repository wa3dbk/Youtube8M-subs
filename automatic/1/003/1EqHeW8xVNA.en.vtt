lineup I'm selecting the edge of the
suspender<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.730> then<00:03:49.730> what<00:03:49.850> I'm<00:03:49.940> going<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.150> do

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
suspender and then what I'm going to do

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.530 
suspender and then what I'm going to do
is<00:03:50.480> go<00:03:50.660> down<00:03:50.870> where<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.970> suspender<00:03:52.970> should<00:03:53.300> be

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
is go down where the suspender should be

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.990 
is go down where the suspender should be
and<00:03:54.730> line<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:55.910> up<00:03:56.030> perfectly<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.610> then<00:03:58.610> drag

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
and line it up perfectly and then drag

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.930 
and line it up perfectly and then drag
up<00:03:59.300> and<00:03:59.510> down<00:03:59.630> to<00:04:00.110> create<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:01.160> missing<00:04:01.580> edges

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
up and down to create the missing edges

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.580 
up and down to create the missing edges
this<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.260> suspender<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.470> connect<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.550> the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
this a suspender and connect the the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.750 
this a suspender and connect the the
area<00:04:06.590> above<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:08.410> gash<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.950> area<00:04:10.310> below

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
area above the gash to the area below

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.810 
area above the gash to the area below
and<00:04:11.380> because<00:04:12.380> they<00:04:12.500> lined<00:04:12.739> up<00:04:12.890> perfectly<00:04:13.580> now

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
and because they lined up perfectly now

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.330 
and because they lined up perfectly now
I<00:04:13.850> can<00:04:14.270> drag<00:04:14.989> up<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.350> down<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.830> go<00:04:15.920> left<00:04:16.130> and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
I can drag up and down and go left and

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.250 
I can drag up and down and go left and
right<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:17.049> reconnect<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.310> recreate<00:04:19.310> this<00:04:20.030> is

right and reconnect and recreate this is

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.390 
right and reconnect and recreate this is
suspenders

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.310 

you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.590 

as<00:04:37.920> they<00:04:38.100> drag<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.520> brush<00:04:38.730> over<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.180> damaged

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
as they drag the brush over the damaged

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.750 
as they drag the brush over the damaged
area<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.680> can<00:04:40.860> see<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:41.250> still<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.550> little

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
area you can see it's still a little

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.000 
area you can see it's still a little
it's<00:04:42.540> too<00:04:42.810> light<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.200> doesn't<00:04:43.380> quite<00:04:43.680> match

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
it's too light it doesn't quite match

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.460 
it's too light it doesn't quite match
and<00:04:44.370> that's<00:04:45.360> because<00:04:45.720> they<00:04:45.870> have<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.140> opacity

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
and that's because they have the opacity

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.630 
and that's because they have the opacity
of<00:04:46.880> 53%<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.870> I'll<00:04:48.990> go<00:04:49.200> over<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.560> area<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.100> then

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
of 53% so I'll go over the area and then

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.120 
of 53% so I'll go over the area and then
I'll<00:04:50.760> release<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.360> brush<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:51.980> then<00:04:52.980> I'll

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
I'll release the brush and then I'll

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.940 
I'll release the brush and then I'll
drag<00:04:53.550> over<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.060> again<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.600> each<00:04:55.350> time<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> go

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
drag over it again and each time I go

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.550 
drag over it again and each time I go
over<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.460> they'll<00:04:57.420> get<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.690> little<00:04:57.870> darker<00:04:58.410> and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
over it they'll get a little darker and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.120 
over it they'll get a little darker and
a<00:04:58.620> little<00:04:58.710> darker<00:04:59.190> if<00:04:59.400> you<00:05:00.410> go<00:05:01.410> over<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.770> area

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
a little darker if you go over the area

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.470 
a little darker if you go over the area
and<00:05:03.650> back<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:04.860> forth<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.250> few<00:05:05.400> times<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:06.360> you

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
and back and forth a few times but you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.450 
and back and forth a few times but you
don't<00:05:06.720> release<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.290> brush<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.830> won't<00:05:08.070> get<00:05:08.250> any

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
don't release the brush it won't get any

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.480 
don't release the brush it won't get any
darker<00:05:08.640> but<00:05:09.000> if<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.210> release<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.810> brush<00:05:10.050> and

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
darker but if you release the brush and

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.770 
darker but if you release the brush and
then<00:05:11.490> go<00:05:11.640> over<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:11.940> again<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.210> get<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.510> little

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
then go over it again I get a little

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.910 
then go over it again I get a little
darker<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:15.240> each<00:05:15.480> time<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.930> release<00:05:16.740> the

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
darker and each time you release the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.530 
darker and each time you release the
brush<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.310> go<00:05:17.400> over<00:05:17.460> it'll<00:05:17.760> get<00:05:17.940> darker<00:05:18.360> and

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
brush and go over it'll get darker and

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.760 
brush and go over it'll get darker and
darker<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:21.690> sounds<00:05:22.050> kind<00:05:22.080> of<00:05:22.290> redundant

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
darker and that sounds kind of redundant

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:32.300 
darker and that sounds kind of redundant
I<00:05:22.830> guess<00:05:23.210> that's<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.390> way<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.630> works

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.410 

now<00:05:33.300> I'm<00:05:33.420> going<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:33.600> go<00:05:33.780> up<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.110> select<00:05:34.680> an

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
now I'm going to go up and select an

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.610 
now I'm going to go up and select an
undamaged<00:05:36.420> part<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.110> edge<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.500> the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
undamaged part of the edge of the

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.230 
undamaged part of the edge of the
suspenders<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:40.550> continue<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.730> edge<00:05:41.940> down

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
suspenders and continue that edge down

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.300 
suspenders and continue that edge down
to<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.750> lower<00:05:42.930> part<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.470> suspender<00:05:44.100> and

to the lower part of the suspender and

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.629 
to the lower part of the suspender and
just<00:05:45.210> finish<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:45.540> up<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.520> complete<00:05:47.520> the

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
just finish it up and complete the

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
connection between the top and bottom

00:05:49.020 --> 00:06:01.379 
connection between the top and bottom
halves<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:50.450> that'll<00:05:51.450> be<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.660> for<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:51.900> video
