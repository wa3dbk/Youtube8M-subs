 sports calculations 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.089

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.969
 here would be important point 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.929
 like me 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.929
 image because this opportunity exists 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:19.159
 insults to move without credibility and luckily she 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.189
 Natalie Housing 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:22.289
 ef 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.679
 next year 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:25.889
 has changed 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.859

 does not look like anyone 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.529
 What would the game be a vigil 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.529
 taking the times you want or three times faster 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.679
 hence 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:02.199

 file 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.529
 the idea is another game 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.840
 already been synonymous with class 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.840
 anything that is still close to 6 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.840
 if I find out who's around 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.139
 The two days he spoke. 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.169
