okay<00:00:10.440> well<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.460> now<00:00:11.759> made<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> farm<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
okay well it's now made on the farm and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.160 
okay well it's now made on the farm and
we're<00:00:13.559> probably<00:00:13.860> getting<00:00:14.759> close<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:16.049> know

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
we're probably getting close to you know

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.950 
we're probably getting close to you know
the<00:00:16.289> cold<00:00:16.529> would<00:00:17.250> end<00:00:17.400> winter<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.810> it's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the cold would end winter so it's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.620 
the cold would end winter so it's
important<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.500> us<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.859> leave<00:00:20.330> now<00:00:21.330> young

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
important for us to leave now young

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
important for us to leave now young
calves<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.130> mothers<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:23.939> can

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
calves off the mothers so that they can

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.279 
calves off the mothers so that they can
go<00:00:24.240> through<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.480> winter<00:00:24.779> comfortably

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
go through that winter comfortably

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.740 
go through that winter comfortably
before<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.769> carve<00:00:26.039> next<00:00:26.369> spring<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.570> we've

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
before they carve next spring so we've

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
before they carve next spring so we've
got<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> whole<00:00:28.140> herd<00:00:28.470> together<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> we're

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
got the whole herd together and we're

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.700 
got the whole herd together and we're
using<00:00:30.539> three<00:00:31.439> strands<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.279> poly<00:00:32.940> wire<00:00:33.710> only

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
using three strands of poly wire only

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.430 
using three strands of poly wire only
one<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.329> our<00:00:37.260> strategy<00:00:37.770> today<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
one and our strategy today is going to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.750 
one and our strategy today is going to
see<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.770> leverage<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.489> calves

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
see if we can leverage the calves

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.200 
see if we can leverage the calves
tendency<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.500> walk<00:00:44.129> underneath<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.789> single

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
tendency to walk underneath that single

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
tendency to walk underneath that single
strand<00:00:45.469> wire<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.460> they've<00:00:47.640> been

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
strand wire that which they've been

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
strand wire that which they've been
doing<00:00:48.000> most<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> time<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.770> we'll

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
doing most of the time and then we'll

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.299 
doing most of the time and then we'll
see<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.550> sort<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> fly<00:00:51.180> trap<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.809> into

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
see if we can sort of fly trap them into

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
see if we can sort of fly trap them into
tomorrow's<00:00:53.360> pasture<00:00:54.360> strip<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.500> can

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
tomorrow's pasture strip so that we can

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.110 
tomorrow's pasture strip so that we can
you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.100> sort<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> separate<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:56.969> from

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you know sort of separate them from

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
you know sort of separate them from
their<00:00:57.300> mothers<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.020> we'll<00:00:58.649> armor<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
their mothers and then we'll armor that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
their mothers and then we'll armor that
that<00:01:00.000> division<00:01:00.539> again<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.170> they<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.559> get

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that division again so that they can get

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
that division again so that they can get
back<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.190> their<00:01:02.399> mothers<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.690> whole

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
back to their mothers and then the whole

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.910 
back to their mothers and then the whole
idea<00:01:04.260> behind<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
idea behind this is that we're going to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
idea behind this is that we're going to
keep<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> mothers<00:01:08.369> near<00:01:08.610> by<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> car<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
keep the mothers near by the car so that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
keep the mothers near by the car so that
there's<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.560> too<00:01:10.710> much<00:01:10.830> commotion<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
there's not too much commotion and you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
there's not too much commotion and you
know<00:01:12.720> waiting<00:01:13.260> cause<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.770> nice<00:01:13.979> quiet

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
know waiting cause it's nice quiet

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.240 
know waiting cause it's nice quiet
gentle<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> friendly<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> earth<00:01:16.250> because

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
gentle and friendly to the earth because

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
gentle and friendly to the earth because
most<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.090> farms<00:01:18.450> when<00:01:18.600> people

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
most of the time on farms when people

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
most of the time on farms when people
wean<00:01:19.140> they'll<00:01:19.920> put<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> calves<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.909> side

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
wean they'll put the calves on one side

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.340 
wean they'll put the calves on one side
of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> farm<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> they'll<00:01:21.780> put<00:01:21.960> their<00:01:22.140> cows

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
of the farm and they'll put their cows

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
of the farm and they'll put their cows
on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> other<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:24.000> cows<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on the other and then there's cows and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
on the other and then there's cows and
calves<00:01:24.659> jumping<00:01:25.110> over<00:01:25.290> every<00:01:25.530> last<00:01:25.650> pence<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
calves jumping over every last pence and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.219 
calves jumping over every last pence and
mayhem<00:01:26.640> ensures<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> nobody's<00:01:27.900> happy

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
mayhem ensures and nobody's happy

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.710 
mayhem ensures and nobody's happy
so<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:29.310> calves<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.850> almost<00:01:30.119> been<00:01:30.360> waiting

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
so these calves have almost been waiting

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
so these calves have almost been waiting
themselves<00:01:31.259> which<00:01:31.409> you've<00:01:31.560> been<00:01:31.799> seeing<00:01:32.119> as

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
themselves which you've been seeing as

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
themselves which you've been seeing as
we<00:01:33.270> move<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:33.630> through<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.900> last<00:01:34.079> field

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
we move them through the last field

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
we move them through the last field
they'll<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.159> under<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.670> line<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
they'll go under that little line and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760 
they'll go under that little line and
they'll<00:01:36.360> wander<00:01:36.689> around<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> field<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
they'll wander around the field and so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.910 
they'll wander around the field and so
forth<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.820> sort<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> ready<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.920> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
forth so that's sort of ready for you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
forth so that's sort of ready for you
know<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> next<00:01:41.130> stage<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.990> little<00:01:42.990> bit<00:01:43.079> more

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
know the next stage a little bit more

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.830 
know the next stage a little bit more
independent<00:01:43.380> their<00:01:43.770> mothers<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:45.149> when<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.750> go

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
independent their mothers so when we go

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.399 
independent their mothers so when we go
and<00:01:45.930> set<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:47.869> ok<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:48.930> we've<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.229> finished

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and set it up ok so we've just finished

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.999 
and set it up ok so we've just finished
the<00:01:49.740> set<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.159> Sophie<00:01:51.000> we've<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.009> novel

the set up Sophie we've got a novel

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.330 
the set up Sophie we've got a novel

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
little design here for low stress

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:23.690 
little design here for low stress

we've<00:02:57.490> sort<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.790> caught<00:02:58.030> them<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.290> they<00:03:00.070> won't

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
we've sort of caught them and they won't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.590 
we've sort of caught them and they won't
be<00:03:00.340> able<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.550> go<00:03:00.640> back<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.910> their<00:03:01.060> mothers<00:03:01.360> cuz

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
that's that wire then opening that

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.270 
that's that wire then opening that
gateway<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.350> we've<00:03:05.500> created<00:03:05.709> for<00:03:06.130> them

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
gateway that we've created for them

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.580 
gateway that we've created for them
won't<00:03:06.910> be<00:03:07.090> there<00:03:07.269> that'll<00:03:07.540> be<00:03:07.660> three<00:03:08.260> spools

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
won't be there that'll be three spools

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.770 
won't be there that'll be three spools
don't<00:03:08.890> straight<00:03:09.160> back<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:10.630> we'll<00:03:10.750> have

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
don't straight back so then we'll have

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.500 
don't straight back so then we'll have
those<00:03:11.140> cards<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.790> may<00:03:12.970> put<00:03:13.209> them<00:03:13.360> in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
those cards and we may put them in

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.070 
those cards and we may put them in
another<00:03:13.690> strip<00:03:14.080> again<00:03:14.790> beyond<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.989> know

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
another strip again beyond the you know

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.890 
another strip again beyond the you know
today's<00:03:17.380> new<00:03:17.680> one<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.940> we<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.660> do<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
today's new one so that we can do the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.420 
today's new one so that we can do the
process<00:03:20.080> again<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.739> see<00:03:20.860> if<00:03:20.890> we<00:03:21.070> can<00:03:21.220> catch

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
process again and see if we can catch

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.020 
process again and see if we can catch
the<00:03:21.670> rest<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.090> car<00:03:25.890> yeah<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.880> that

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the rest of the car yeah and and that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.759 
the rest of the car yeah and and that
way<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.300> cards<00:03:28.660> are<00:03:28.810> near<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.410> near<00:03:29.620> their

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
way the cards are near it near their

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.400 
way the cards are near it near their
mothers<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:31.360> way<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.780> won't<00:03:31.959> have<00:03:32.170> any

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
mothers and that way we won't have any

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.680 
mothers and that way we won't have any
fence<00:03:32.680> jumping<00:03:33.190> or<00:03:33.370> mayhem<00:03:33.580> there'll<00:03:34.570> be<00:03:34.600> a

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
fence jumping or mayhem there'll be a

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.960 
fence jumping or mayhem there'll be a
bit<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.989> whinging<00:03:35.739> like<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> car<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.790> cars

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
bit of whinging like the car the cars

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.790 
bit of whinging like the car the cars
will<00:03:37.120> want<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.360> go<00:03:37.510> back<00:03:37.780> today<00:03:37.989> but<00:03:38.620> they'll

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
will want to go back today but they'll

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.940 
will want to go back today but they'll
be<00:03:38.890> deterred<00:03:39.250> by<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.670> three<00:03:39.940> strand<00:03:40.239> wire<00:03:40.510> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
be deterred by this three strand wire so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.560 
be deterred by this three strand wire so
we're<00:03:41.950> hoping<00:03:42.190> until<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.550> flytrap<00:03:42.820> system

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
we're hoping until the flytrap system

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.110 
we're hoping until the flytrap system
will<00:03:43.690> be<00:03:43.810> effective<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:45.070> what<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.430> allows<00:03:46.090> us

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
will be effective and what it allows us

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.949 
will be effective and what it allows us
to<00:03:46.660> avoid<00:03:47.200> doing<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.920> drafting<00:03:48.630> if<00:03:49.630> we<00:03:49.780> were<00:03:49.870> to

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
to avoid doing is drafting if we were to

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.360 
to avoid doing is drafting if we were to
go<00:03:50.080> through<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.410> hood<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.620> try<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.950> separate

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
go through that hood and try to separate

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.610 
go through that hood and try to separate
all<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.120> carbs<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.630> drive<00:03:52.900> them<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.320> here

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
all the the carbs and drive them in here

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.650 
all the the carbs and drive them in here
manually<00:03:54.400> everybody<00:03:55.300> would<00:03:55.420> get<00:03:55.480> agitated

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
manually everybody would get agitated

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.509 
manually everybody would get agitated
and<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.440> whole<00:03:56.590> seam<00:03:56.860> would<00:03:57.010> become<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.340> little

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
and the whole seam would become a little

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.900 
and the whole seam would become a little
bit<00:03:57.730> chaotic<00:03:58.380> worse<00:03:59.380> than<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.890> if<00:04:00.459> we<00:04:00.640> go<00:04:00.790> up

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
bit chaotic worse than that if we go up

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.580 
bit chaotic worse than that if we go up
to<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.180> yards<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.660> do<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.320> know<00:04:02.440> although

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
to the yards and do it you know although

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.780 
to the yards and do it you know although
the<00:04:02.709> yards<00:04:03.130> use<00:04:03.250> that's<00:04:03.430> usually<00:04:03.670> where

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
the yards use that's usually where

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.160 
the yards use that's usually where
people<00:04:04.000> do<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.299> sort<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.540> stuff<00:04:04.720> easy<00:04:05.019> to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
people do this sort of stuff easy to

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.320 
people do this sort of stuff easy to
sort<00:04:05.440> them<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.830> lot<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.370> commotion<00:04:06.670> I'm<00:04:07.180> going

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
sort them a lot of commotion I'm going

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.539 
sort them a lot of commotion I'm going
to<00:04:07.390> move<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.600> whole<00:04:07.720> hood<00:04:07.959> so<00:04:08.530> with<00:04:09.430> this

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
to move the whole hood so with this

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.980 
to move the whole hood so with this
system<00:04:09.790> we're<00:04:10.120> hoping<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.420> be<00:04:10.570> able<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.750> do<00:04:10.870> it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
system we're hoping to be able to do it

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.340 
system we're hoping to be able to do it
in<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.260> field<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.750> know<00:04:14.080> low

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
in the field and really you know low

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.589 
in the field and really you know low
stress<00:04:14.830> sort<00:04:15.130> of

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
stress sort of

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.259 
stress sort of
all<00:04:15.930> right<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.500> think<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.889> should<00:04:17.009> work<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
all right I think it should work the

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.290 
all right I think it should work the
problems<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.630> solution<00:04:22.109> right<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:24.030> we'll<00:04:24.180> come

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
problems of solution right so we'll come

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.870 
problems of solution right so we'll come
back<00:04:24.449> in<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.660> afternoon<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.380> see<00:04:25.949> how<00:04:26.520> idea

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
back in the afternoon and see how idea

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.330 
back in the afternoon and see how idea
was<00:04:27.030> kooky<00:04:27.419> or<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:28.370> results<00:04:29.370> okay
