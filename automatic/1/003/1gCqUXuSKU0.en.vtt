00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 hey people here and today i still have 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 information for you regarding the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 colleges the ghosts multiplayers and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 black ops 2 in the new combo you like that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.900
 Committee is up every year yesterday 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.100
 I will not post a video on facebook 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.570
 but have a point of view 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.590
 changed now because the trailer is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 really cool and there really is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 a lot of information even if I have the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 Do not have rights that I have the trailer 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 can upload and that we equal him 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.500
 I can give you all a look at me 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.699
 information and the links to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.260
 right trailer then into the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.270
 but in any case first 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.550
 time to call of duty ghost multiplayer 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 it is a very small picture that have 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.600
 she posted on twitter last night 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 or last night actually and that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.870
 is really blatant, no one thinks 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.510
 There is a lot going on there 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.039
 multiplayer reveal 14 august but pay attention 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 But look at the background 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.590
 top left 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.789
 the eerc and he looks after me completely 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.890
 nimbly out I think thats 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.510
 really everything special and look 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.800
 right down and do not tell me 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 that he does not think that will plunder 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.879
 travels that is clearly plunderer 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.399
 and one over it that something like 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 bullet proof vest and lower left that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.540
 is drones stÃ¶hrers call of duty 4 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.430
 something like mind or food 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.229
 and right now up there I do not have any 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.250
 know what that should be there you can 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 Maybe that in the comments 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.710
 write 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 if you have any idea but up 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.900
 every now and then there is something else 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 I thought so 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 but you see the two major surgeries 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.450
 So take these two big pictures once 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.490
 some guy with mask and 9live 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 and once a big one was thought leader 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.860
 a cannon 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.439
 I think that maybe those me 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 main works gives that one something 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.150
 that's almost like having something to eat 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.770
 mac and drones disturb and so can 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.329
 to use everything with this upper one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.670
 and with the bottom things like 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.409
 bulletproof vest and raider because 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.820
 so it is more of a really big cannon 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.530
 I'm not sure but write 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.060
 give me your opinion and your ideas too 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.799
 the whole thing in the comments 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 I know we will all this on the 14th 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.070
 But I'm interested in hearing about it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 that's just it and me 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.200
 I'm so home 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.369
 and I would be happy if you could help me 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.909
 your opinion in the comments 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.710
 write 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.930
 but it also has come also felt 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.430
 she was really the trailer 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.840
 interesting at the beginning there is each 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 history then a beginning and then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 Just all of them are increasingly running through the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.659
 black ops dreaming does not count 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.300
 So it was black ops and world at now 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.849
 clear essential cinema of the dead then are 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.780
 we at the world at was the giant 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.180
 crazy and then night 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.370
 and really kill the rent from end to end 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.230
 start back and you get a sneak 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 peek to the first map and how zombies 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.050
 actually originated 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 between the nets it is so small 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 sneak peeks but you can not do much 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.030
 but now specialists in 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.800
 Of course, our community trade 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.420
 already solved and you even see 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.250
 a picture so if you have several pictures 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.020
 you can then see together 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 like a zombie tied to a table 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.140
 is and just made experiments 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.760
 this is perhaps the first one 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.290
 zombie teams ever existed 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.819
 and then the virus has continued 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.230
 I can not spend much on it 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.000
 I would just say that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.310
 has something to do with the origin of the tommi virus 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.050
 definitely interesting and to do 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.370
 the second picture is more about it 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.480
 of the dead and I think so 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 Funny because that's nothing 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.260
 it has two things to do with the story 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.920
 all read and these are two numbers 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.269
 above once 48 1b and once 38 6 a the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.220
 The cell numbers are the more of the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.390
 Date characters do not know what I mean 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.680
 to start writing to me 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.600
 maybe that's the comments if you guys 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.500
 the one field but now comes only that 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.030
 epic end 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.380
 you still know at the beginning of the trailer 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.180
 stood by every story has one 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.110
 at the beginning and now they are still writing 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.190
 and an end 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.810
 and suddenly it's black and white 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.970
 It has become very exciting that finally came 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.310
 a video clip that a type of battlefield 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.150
 wobbled quite oldschool and suddenly 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.739
 comes a huge robot really 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 optimistic part of transformers and 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.220
 get on the guy on it and then it is 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.930
 the trailer out of that is just crazy 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.250
 clearly something of the way I have 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.959
 nothing understood at all 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.579
 writes me once out in the comments 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.079
 You also say after watching the video then 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.430
 I've seen the couple 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.860
 screenshots but you can not see that 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.090
 so much so that it is just amazing 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.160
 then you also pull the short 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.230
 characters so the young characters 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.150
 of the right zombie characters of 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.040
 the main characters so nicolai fc 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.450
 However, everyone knows rhade and sees 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.769
 one holds the young version of those 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.720
 this is probably still true 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.310
 at the very beginning of the origin of the whole 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.530
 zombie story there I am quite 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.940
 curious and just that element 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.650
 robot thinks that wants evil and that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.170
 the evil but maybe that's exactly 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.760
 the contrary because of this shaky type 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.920
 Maybe you were there in the view of one 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.850
 zombies and those with the robot 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.380
 the rose on it 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.880
 that must have happened with that too 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.769
 otherwise you would have the robot 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.180
 survived what but first for the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.380
 video I hope you liked it and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.549
 i was able to give you good and fast new ones 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.650
 bring information 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.940
 if that was the case then I'm fine 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.590
 I want a thumbs up 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.110
 By the way, thank the last video
