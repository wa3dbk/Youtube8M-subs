00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Unfortunately sir, we do not have good news 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Yesterday morning at 3 o'clock, the Strokes killed him at the Isle of Wight. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Then back to Rockness and Lollapalooza. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 The group crossed the United States faster than we thought and was in full swing at Austin City Limits at 10:15. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 No problem. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 They have not released songs for years. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 My F端hrer ... 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 The Strokes ... 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 The Strokes finished their fourth album last night. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Casablancas and Fraiture confirmed it on Twitter. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Anyone who has "is this it", "room on fire" or "first impressions" on their iPods ... 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 leave the room now. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 How could this have happened? 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Why have not I been informed earlier? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 How New York Fashionistas dare to make a record! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 This is unacceptable. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 The whole project is completely dead now! 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 How will my group dominate the world now? 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 I can not compete with their catchy melodies! 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 You said they were going to separate! What happened ? 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 My F端hrer, to be honest, the music you write is not so good, to begin with ... 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 What do you know about good music ?! 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 I heard you listen to Justin Bieber just before! 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 My F端hrer, you scam the songs of Creed! 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 I do not fail Creed! 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Creed ruins me! 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Connards! 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 I already see the headlines. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 "The Strokes save rock with their fourth album ... 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 while the Hitlers are still bad. " 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 My powerful ballads will have no chance against their singles! 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 They will monopolize all the attention of music magazines! 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 When this album will come out ... 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 my music will tumble in the rankings ... 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 I'll be after Stalin! 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 People from privileged backgrounds do not deserve to make music. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Me! I am a real artist! 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 I started from nothing! 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 What is this mess. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Damn, I'm the one who brought Chuck Taylors back into fashion! 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Nobody remembers? 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Now, I have no hope of getting hold of Britain 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 They are so overrated. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I can not believe that people really like them. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 All copies of this album will be burned! 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Do not worry. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 We will remove it from iTunes. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 It's only a matter of time now. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Warren Fu is probably already recording new videos for them. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 It's going to be awesome. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 It's over now. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 People will regain hope in the music. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 You know the next info ... 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Radiohead will record a new album too. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 My F端hrer ... on this subject ...
