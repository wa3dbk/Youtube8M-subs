i mean you know we're seeing a lot of
clones<00:00:39.449> and<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.260> silicon<00:00:41.070> valley<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> exploding

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
clones and a silicon valley is exploding

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 
clones and a silicon valley is exploding
as<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> lot<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.720> fluff<00:00:43.230> coming<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> valley

as a lot of fluff coming to the valley

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
as a lot of fluff coming to the valley
she<00:00:44.850> would<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> find<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.750> sort

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
she would you find that you have to sort

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
she would you find that you have to sort
the<00:00:46.079> wheat<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.470> chaff<00:00:47.180> yeah<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> mean<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the wheat from the chaff yeah I mean a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.970 
the wheat from the chaff yeah I mean a
little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.870> i<00:00:48.899> mean<00:00:49.170> i<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.710> there's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
little bit i mean i don't think there's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.770 
little bit i mean i don't think there's
any<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.430> bad<00:00:50.700> stories<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.719> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
any really bad stories up here it's just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
any really bad stories up here it's just
like<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.350> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.950> vocal<00:00:53.790> pitch<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like a lot of it was the vocal pitch in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
like a lot of it was the vocal pitch in
presentations<00:00:54.660> sometimes<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.620> little

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
presentations sometimes it's a little

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.910 
presentations sometimes it's a little
hard<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.160> us<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> maybe<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.829> know

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
hard for us to maybe here so you know

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.369 
hard for us to maybe here so you know
we'd<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.760> some<00:00:59.940> energy<00:01:00.300> i'd<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
we'd like to see some energy i'd like to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
we'd like to see some energy i'd like to
see<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> little<00:01:01.739> varying<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.520> x<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
see a little varying of x how the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.960 
see a little varying of x how the
presentation<00:01:03.780> goes<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.489> past<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.940> I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
presentation goes so past that then I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.249 
presentation goes so past that then I
think<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.270> were<00:01:06.360> sort<00:01:06.539> of<00:01:06.570> diving<00:01:06.780> into<00:01:07.140> why

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
think we were sort of diving into why

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.499 
think we were sort of diving into why
the<00:01:07.320> products<00:01:07.740> worked<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.070> didn't<00:01:08.280> work<00:01:08.509> you

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
the products worked or didn't work you

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.719 
the products worked or didn't work you
just<00:01:09.690> said<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.899> design<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.310> important

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
just said that design was more important

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
just said that design was more important
than<00:01:11.869> technology<00:01:12.869> yeah<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.500> gonna<00:01:13.619> get

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
than technology yeah I'm gonna get

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
than technology yeah I'm gonna get
ripped<00:01:14.039> by<00:01:14.220> people<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.700> saying<00:01:14.910> that<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
ripped by people for saying that right I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.930 
ripped by people for saying that right I
mean<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.560> certainly<00:01:16.709> as<00:01:17.220> important

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
mean I think it's certainly as important

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.449 
mean I think it's certainly as important
as<00:01:18.119> technology<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.500> many<00:01:19.920> consumer

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
as technology and in many consumer

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.730 
as technology and in many consumer
services<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.420> yes<00:01:21.569> it<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.709> know

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
services I think yes it can be you know

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.169 
services I think yes it can be you know
more<00:01:22.979> important<00:01:23.399> you<00:01:23.550> still<00:01:23.759> need<00:01:23.910> great

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
more important you still need great

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:25.609 
more important you still need great
coders<00:01:24.569> and<00:01:24.600> people<00:01:25.050> that<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.259> actually<00:01:25.380> able

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
coders and people that are actually able

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.930 
coders and people that are actually able
to<00:01:25.709> produce<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.759> great

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
to produce really you know great

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.809 
to produce really you know great
technology<00:01:27.569> but<00:01:27.869> oftentimes<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.759> know

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
technology but oftentimes the you know

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.999 
technology but oftentimes the you know
differentiating<00:01:30.420> factor<00:01:30.780> between<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.500> good

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
differentiating factor between a good

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190 
differentiating factor between a good
and<00:01:32.069> a<00:01:32.310> great<00:01:32.520> product<00:01:32.819> is<00:01:33.149> not<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.660> technology

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and a great product is not a technology

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
and a great product is not a technology
but<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.979> design<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.490> user<00:01:35.670> experience

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
but the design and the user experience

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.050 
but the design and the user experience
as<00:01:37.110> an<00:01:37.289> investor<00:01:37.800> what<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.429> you<00:01:38.520> looking<00:01:38.819> for

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
as an investor what are you looking for

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.620 
as an investor what are you looking for
in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.330> startup<00:01:41.209> passion<00:01:42.209> around<00:01:42.330> the

in the startup passion around the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.419 
in the startup passion around the
customer<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> solving<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.860> problem<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
customer and solving a problem is

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.490 
customer and solving a problem is
usually<00:01:44.849> a<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.390> significant<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:46.380> know

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
usually a pretty significant you know

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
usually a pretty significant you know
thing<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.130> me<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.580> customer<00:01:48.390> definition

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
thing for me so customer definition

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.330 
thing for me so customer definition
understanding<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.590> customers<00:01:49.920> problem<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
understanding that customers problem and
