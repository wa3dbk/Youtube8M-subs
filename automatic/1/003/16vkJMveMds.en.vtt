luminous

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.380 
luminous
light<00:04:17.870> like<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.560> flash<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.400> camera<00:04:19.430> um<00:04:19.910> it

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
light like a flash of a camera um it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.159 
light like a flash of a camera um it
started<00:04:20.870> as<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.770> just<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:22.100> small<00:04:22.340> little<00:04:23.169> pin

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
started as if just a small little pin

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.460 
started as if just a small little pin
and<00:04:24.440> then<00:04:24.680> open<00:04:25.100> out<00:04:25.390> to<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.419> rectangular<00:04:27.260> shape

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and then open out to a rectangular shape

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.640 
and then open out to a rectangular shape
and<00:04:27.740> then<00:04:27.950> just<00:04:28.160> disappeared<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:29.440> thought<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.590> a

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
and then just disappeared I thought of a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.260 
and then just disappeared I thought of a
strange<00:04:30.919> rise<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.669> didn't<00:04:32.030> really<00:04:32.180> think

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
strange rise but I didn't really think

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.680 
strange rise but I didn't really think
much<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.590> after<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.220> while<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.630> saw<00:04:35.630> the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
much of it and after a while I saw the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.080 
much of it and after a while I saw the
same<00:04:35.930> thing<00:04:36.169> again<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.560> left<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:37.070> us<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.880> if

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
same thing again to left of us like if

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.180 
same thing again to left of us like if
it<00:04:38.210> was<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.390> plane<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:39.050> know<00:04:39.169> there<00:04:39.800> was<00:04:39.919> no<00:04:40.040> way

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
it was a plane you know there was no way

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.970 
it was a plane you know there was no way
that<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.490> could<00:04:40.820> have<00:04:40.970> been<00:04:41.180> across<00:04:41.980> this

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
that it could have been across this

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.370 
that it could have been across this
point<00:04:43.280> here<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.640> then<00:04:43.760> suddenly<00:04:44.140> over<00:04:45.140> here

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
point here and then suddenly over here

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.590 
point here and then suddenly over here
like<00:04:45.560> but<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.010> minute<00:04:46.310> like<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.640> was<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:47.120> was
