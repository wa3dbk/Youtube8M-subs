you'll<00:03:48.810> notice<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.320> am<00:03:49.440> holding<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.799> with<00:03:49.859> two

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
you'll notice I am holding it with two

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.420 
you'll notice I am holding it with two
hands<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.420> great<00:03:51.750> sword<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.920> it's

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
hands so that is a great sword but it's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.580 
hands so that is a great sword but it's
faster<00:03:53.940> just<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.299> suit<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.690> original<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.320> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
faster just to suit the original so the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.250 
faster just to suit the original so the
speed<00:03:55.890> has<00:03:56.010> been<00:03:56.070> increased<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:57.450> it's<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.870> quite
