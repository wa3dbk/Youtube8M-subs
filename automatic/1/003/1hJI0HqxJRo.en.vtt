00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
different ways the living dining area I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
different ways the living dining area I
had<00:01:19.380> mostly<00:01:19.710> tones<00:01:20.070> some<00:01:20.880> pale<00:01:21.090> greens<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
had mostly tones some pale greens of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
had mostly tones some pale greens of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
some shots of other colors there are

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.330 
some shots of other colors there are
different<00:01:24.299> hues<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> purples<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.220> those

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
different hues of purples I think those

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
different hues of purples I think those
are<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.490> colors<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.420> work<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:27.960> in

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
are all colors that work really well in

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.100 
are all colors that work really well in
this<00:01:28.560> mountain<00:01:28.920> settings<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.600> use<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.810> lot<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
this mountain settings I use a lot of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280 
this mountain settings I use a lot of
texture<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.920> work<00:01:32.189> because<00:01:33.290> texture

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
texture and my work because texture

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
texture and my work because texture
provides<00:01:35.299> definition<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.659> spaces<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.700> adds<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
provides definition to spaces it adds a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.780 
provides definition to spaces it adds a
layer<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.530> interest<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> gives<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
layer of interest I think it gives it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.110 
layer of interest I think it gives it
some<00:01:42.000> richness<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> space

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
some richness to a space

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.040 
some richness to a space
I<00:01:46.280> didn't<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.550> all<00:01:47.730> being<00:01:48.510> like<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
I didn't see it all being like a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.710 
I didn't see it all being like a
mountain<00:01:49.500> space<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> also<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.150> glamorous

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of glamour in that mix there needs to be

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450 
of glamour in that mix there needs to be
some<00:01:57.030> drama<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.870> needs<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.230> be<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:59.220> ah

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
element and design well I think you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.330 
element and design well I think you
always<00:02:03.120> need<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.300> take<00:02:03.390> design<00:02:03.900> risks<00:02:04.350> for

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
always need to take design risks for

I think the finished space it's very

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.970 
I think the finished space it's very
much<00:02:21.060> representative<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:22.260> One<00:02:22.620> Kings<00:02:22.830> Lane
