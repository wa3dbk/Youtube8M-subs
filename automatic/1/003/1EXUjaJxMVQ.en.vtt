is a spyderco grasshopper thought I'd

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.400 
is a spyderco grasshopper thought I'd
start<00:00:34.710> small<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.070> work<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.520> way<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:36.410> pretty

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
start small and work my way up pretty

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.340 
start small and work my way up pretty
simple<00:00:37.730> flames<00:00:38.730> pattern<00:00:39.270> done<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
simple flames pattern done it in the

kind of hot rod style nothing to to
special<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:46.370> left<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.670> flames<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> kind

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
special but left the flames of the kind

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
special but left the flames of the kind
of<00:00:48.780> satin<00:00:49.110> finish<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.680> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.010> into

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
of satin finish they want to get into

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.479 
of satin finish they want to get into
mirrored<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.890> pretty<00:00:53.160> happy<00:00:53.370> with

mirrored and but I'm pretty happy with

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
mirrored and but I'm pretty happy with
the<00:00:53.640> way<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> came<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:55.129> protected

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
the way it came out you know protected
obviously<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.199> goblins<00:00:58.680> were<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
obviously all the the goblins were it

obviously all the the goblins were it
goes<00:00:59.699> into<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> knife<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:02.370> still<00:01:02.640> opens

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
goes into the knife and it still opens

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
goes into the knife and it still opens
and<00:01:03.600> closes<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> grasshopper

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and closes as well as the grasshopper

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.070 
and closes as well as the grasshopper
does<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> tiny<00:01:06.510> little<00:01:06.750> knife

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
does because it's a tiny little knife

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
does because it's a tiny little knife
and<00:01:07.350> here's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> pain<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> ass<00:01:08.490> but

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
came out actually it is isn't you know

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
came out actually it is isn't you know
not<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> massively<00:01:49.560> d<00:01:49.829> pitch<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.579> deep

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
not a massively d pitch but it's deep

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.840 
not a massively d pitch but it's deep
enough<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.960> local<00:01:52.829> right<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.490> pretty
