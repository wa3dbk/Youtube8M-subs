00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
could say then we're getting frames

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.719 
could say then we're getting frames
where<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.049> frames<00:01:10.380> around<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
where you can put frames around it and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
where you can put frames around it and
just<00:01:11.909> different<00:01:12.119> types<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.869> make

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
just different types and you can make

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
just different types and you can make
adjust<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> frame<00:01:13.920> width<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
adjust the frame width and then you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
adjust the frame width and then you
could<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.049> different<00:01:16.830> frame

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
image okay you can always compare to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
image okay you can always compare to
what<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.659> originally<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.810 
what is originally like it what it is
now<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.079> down<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> always

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
now and down here right here it always

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
now and down here right here it always
has<00:01:36.000> set<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> brightness<00:01:37.530> style

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
just let go and then you do like always

you<00:02:40.790> go<00:02:41.270> down<00:02:41.420> here<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.720> press<00:02:41.900> apply<00:02:42.220> or<00:02:43.220> you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
you go down here you press apply or you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.540 
you go down here you press apply or you
can<00:02:43.460> undo<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> last<00:02:44.030> thing<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.330> did<00:02:45.550> so

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
can undo the last thing you did so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.940 
can undo the last thing you did so
that's<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.760> different<00:02:47.180> effects<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.660> can

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that's just different effects you can

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.350 
that's just different effects you can
they<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.130> have<00:02:49.280> neat<00:02:49.610> little<00:02:49.820> things<00:02:50.180> that

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
they all have neat little things that

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120 
they all have neat little things that
you<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.660> with<00:02:50.690> them<00:02:50.930> black<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:51.950> why<00:02:52.070> you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
you can do with them black and why you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.680 
you can do with them black and why you
can<00:02:52.610> change<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.060> black<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.570> white<00:02:53.660> of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
can change it to black and white of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.020 
can change it to black and white of
course<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.260> does<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.770> then<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.460> have<00:02:55.580> styles

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
course it does that then you have styles

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.730 
course it does that then you have styles
down<00:02:56.210> here<00:02:56.450> different<00:02:56.690> types<00:02:56.990> of<00:02:57.170> styles<00:02:57.350> of

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
down here different types of styles of

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.340 
down here different types of styles of
the<00:02:57.980> image<00:02:58.330> see<00:02:59.330> how<00:02:59.420> he<00:02:59.480> does<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.140> then

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the image see how he does that and then

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.490 
the image see how he does that and then
you<00:03:00.950> hold<00:03:01.130> down<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.820> can<00:03:01.940> go<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> grain<00:03:02.500> move

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
you hold down you can go to grain move

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.780 
you hold down you can go to grain move
left<00:03:03.710> or<00:03:03.770> right<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.950> change<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.340> grain<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
left or right to change the grain of the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.070 
left or right to change the grain of the
image<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.090> probably<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.510> see<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.810> good<00:03:05.990> on

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
image you probably can see that good on

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.920 
image you probably can see that good on
camera<00:03:06.980> but<00:03:07.970> change<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.240> grant<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.720> image

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
camera but change the grant of the image

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.520 
camera but change the grant of the image
some<00:03:09.110> more<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.440> snow<00:03:09.710> if<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.250> know<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.460> mean

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
some more like snow if you know to mean

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.440 
some more like snow if you know to mean
and<00:03:12.530> then<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> center<00:03:13.580> focus<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.120> course

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
and then the center focus of course

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.710 
and then the center focus of course
already<00:03:14.690> told<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.940> closer<00:03:16.940> in<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.270> blurs

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
already told you closer in it blurs

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.090 
already told you closer in it blurs
everything<00:03:18.110> except<00:03:18.470> right<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.830> center

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
everything except right in the center

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.540 
everything except right in the center
like<00:03:19.280> right<00:03:19.460> here<00:03:19.750> make<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.840> circle<00:03:21.140> bigger

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
like right here make the circle bigger

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.890 
like right here make the circle bigger
and<00:03:22.550> goes<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:22.850> out<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.330> could<00:03:23.450> do<00:03:23.540> styles<00:03:24.340> dark

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
and goes on out you could do styles dark

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.240 
and goes on out you could do styles dark
which<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.050> more<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.470> vignette<00:03:27.800> of<00:03:27.860> course

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
which is more of a vignette of course

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.660 
which is more of a vignette of course
that<00:03:29.120> you're<00:03:29.270> used<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.660> seeing<00:03:30.550> but<00:03:31.550> it's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
that you're used to seeing but it's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.270 
that you're used to seeing but it's
still<00:03:31.790> got<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.060> blur<00:03:32.300> simple<00:03:32.780> thing<00:03:32.960> to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
still got that blur simple thing to

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.980 
still got that blur simple thing to
compare<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.490> contrast<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.030> say<00:03:35.210> how<00:03:35.330> you

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
compare to the contrast you say how you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.960 
compare to the contrast you say how you
know<00:03:36.080> what<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.230> mean<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.650> that's<00:03:37.580> pretty<00:03:37.850> much

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
know what I mean and that's pretty much
