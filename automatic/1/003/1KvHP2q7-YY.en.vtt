all righty so what we're looking at here
is<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:04.380> Honda<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.629> or<00:00:06.629> Z<00:00:07.020> 600<00:00:07.770> crankshaft<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.820> have

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
is a Honda in or Z 600 crankshaft I have

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.240 
is a Honda in or Z 600 crankshaft I have
two<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.870> these<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.490> can<00:00:11.490> see<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:13.250> crankshaft

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
two of these you can see the crankshaft

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.769 
two of these you can see the crankshaft
is<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:15.089> pressed<00:00:15.990> together<00:00:16.199> unit<00:00:17.630> these<00:00:18.630> are

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
is a pressed together unit these are

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.810 
is a pressed together unit these are
both<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.170> excellent<00:00:19.500> shape<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.250> gonna<00:00:20.400> use

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
both an excellent shape I was gonna use

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.900 
both an excellent shape I was gonna use
them<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.060> future<00:00:21.779> rebuilds<00:00:22.609> that<00:00:23.609> I'm<00:00:23.730> just

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
them for future rebuilds that I'm just

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.189 
them for future rebuilds that I'm just
not<00:00:24.000> getting<00:00:24.210> around<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.019> thought

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
not getting around to it and I thought

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.019 
not getting around to it and I thought
maybe<00:00:25.410> somebody<00:00:25.650> else<00:00:25.800> could<00:00:26.070> use<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.460> I've

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
maybe somebody else could use one I've

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939 
maybe somebody else could use one I've
checked<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> bearings<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.619> wouldn't<00:00:28.859> have

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
checked all the bearings I wouldn't have

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.070 
checked all the bearings I wouldn't have
kept<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.310> if<00:00:29.580> they<00:00:29.699> were<00:00:29.760> bad

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
kept these if they were bad

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.010 
kept these if they were bad
there<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.590> no<00:00:31.859> rod<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.669> play<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.239> any<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:33.989> way

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
there is no rod in play in any which way

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.270 
there is no rod in play in any which way
that<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.620> pull<00:00:34.950> or<00:00:35.550> push<00:00:35.930> these<00:00:36.980> teeth<00:00:37.980> look

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
that I pull or push these teeth look

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
that I pull or push these teeth look
really<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.410> camshaft<00:00:41.180> chain<00:00:42.180> all

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
really good on the camshaft chain all

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
really good on the camshaft chain all
the<00:00:42.840> bearings<00:00:43.559> spin<00:00:43.890> nice<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> free<00:00:44.789> there's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the bearings spin nice and free there's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.709 
the bearings spin nice and free there's
no<00:00:45.090> play<00:00:46.700> one<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.539> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
no play one of them I think it's this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:57.250 
no play one of them I think it's this
one<00:00:51.050> has<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:53.329> can<00:00:54.329> focus<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
one has a I can focus in on that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.290 
one has a I can focus in on that
come<00:00:57.920> on<00:00:58.039> come<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:58.250> come<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.460> see<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.030> numbers

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
come on come on come on see the numbers

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.960 
come on come on come on see the numbers
inscribed<00:00:59.750> there<00:01:01.600> 75<00:01:02.600> -<00:01:02.960> 631<00:01:03.829> I<00:01:04.100> wonder<00:01:04.909> if

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
inscribed there 75 - 631 I wonder if

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.679 
inscribed there 75 - 631 I wonder if
this<00:01:05.089> one's<00:01:05.269> been<00:01:05.420> rebuilt<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:07.070> really

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
this one's been rebuilt it's just really

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.190 
this one's been rebuilt it's just really
really<00:01:08.689> nice

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
really nice

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.789 
really nice
they<00:01:09.950> both<00:01:10.130> are<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:11.210> one's<00:01:11.420> got<00:01:11.810> white

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
they both are this one's got white

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.350 
they both are this one's got white
grease<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.399> think<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:13.670> packed<00:01:13.940> grease<00:01:14.210> in

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
grease and I think I packed grease in

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.020 
grease and I think I packed grease in
there<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.740> keep<00:01:15.740> them<00:01:16.000> fresh<00:01:18.729> snouts<00:01:19.729> look

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
there to keep them fresh snouts look

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.590 
there to keep them fresh snouts look
good<00:01:20.210> there's<00:01:20.539> no<00:01:20.720> tears<00:01:21.170> there's<00:01:21.649> no<00:01:21.799> rips

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
good there's no tears there's no rips

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.249 
good there's no tears there's no rips
the<00:01:23.600> other<00:01:24.380> end<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:25.479> guess<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.630> would<00:01:26.780> be<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
the other end I guess this would be the

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.950 
the other end I guess this would be the
clutch<00:01:27.950> end<00:01:28.750> all<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.080> splines<00:01:30.440> look<00:01:30.679> good<00:01:31.960> so

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
clutch end all the splines look good so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.600 
clutch end all the splines look good so
I<00:01:32.990> think<00:01:33.200> I'm<00:01:33.440> gonna<00:01:33.530> let<00:01:33.649> these<00:01:33.860> go<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.340> just

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
I think I'm gonna let these go I just

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.609 
I think I'm gonna let these go I just
wanted<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.060> show<00:01:36.069> interested<00:01:37.069> or<00:01:37.220> perspective

really<00:01:49.729> expensive<00:01:50.090> when<00:01:50.600> they<00:01:50.659> rebuilt<00:01:51.140> and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490
