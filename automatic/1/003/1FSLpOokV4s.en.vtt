00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
get off the planet and so you know this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.530 
get off the planet and so you know this
is<00:01:20.280> something<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.700> thought<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> design<00:01:21.390> team

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
is something we thought as a design team

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
is something we thought as a design team
we<00:01:21.660> thought<00:01:21.810> it'd<00:01:21.870> be<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.050> cool<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.410> let

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
we thought it'd be really cool to let

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.560 
we thought it'd be really cool to let
the<00:01:23.250> player<00:01:23.490> feel<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:23.940> it's<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.540> on

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the player feel what it's like to be on

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.150 
the player feel what it's like to be on
a<00:01:24.690> planet<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> Zerg<00:01:25.619> invader<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> know

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
a planet with the Zerg invader you know

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.859 
a planet with the Zerg invader you know
that's<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.640> terrifying<00:01:27.150> moment<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that's a very terrifying moment and so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.390 
that's a very terrifying moment and so
this<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.410> one<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> missions<00:01:28.830> that<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.250> kind

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this is one of the missions that we kind

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
this is one of the missions that we kind
of<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> execute<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:31.410> way<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of get to execute on that the way the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.840 
of get to execute on that the way the
players<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> win<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
players actually going to win this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
players actually going to win this

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
mission is that he's going to go down to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.370 
mission is that he's going to go down to
the<00:01:34.560> planet<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.729> colonists<00:01:36.300> need<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the planet the colonists need to get to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
the planet the colonists need to get to
the<00:01:37.410> absurd<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.630> kind

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the absurd and so you know this is kind

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
the absurd and so you know this is kind
of<00:01:40.020> back<00:01:40.200> down<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> choices<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.400> we

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
of back down to the the choices that we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.510 
of back down to the the choices that we
talked<00:01:42.150> about<00:01:42.180> putting<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.720> our<00:01:42.840> missions<00:01:43.259> is

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
talked about putting in our missions is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400 
talked about putting in our missions is

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
since they're cut off the colonists are

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.960 
since they're cut off the colonists are
basically<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> drive<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> action<00:01:47.910> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
basically going to drive the action in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.400

some decisions and one of the things

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.410 
some decisions and one of the things
that<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.130> mission<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:21.209> show

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that we do on this mission is we show

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.030 
that we do on this mission is we show
the<00:02:21.600> path<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.080> where<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> trucks<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.920> go

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the path of where the trucks going to go

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.009 
the path of where the trucks going to go
so<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.760> player<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.209> kind<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.420> look<00:02:24.540> ahead<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
so the player can kind of look ahead and

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.270 
so the player can kind of look ahead and
say<00:02:25.140> hey<00:02:25.320> there's<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> little<00:02:25.830> choke<00:02:26.040> point

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
say hey there's a little choke point

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
say hey there's a little choke point
right<00:02:26.430> there<00:02:26.459> or<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.299> looks<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> desert

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
right there or it looks like the desert

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.000 
right there or it looks like the desert
coming<00:02:28.170> here<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.530> could<00:02:28.650> go<00:02:28.769> over<00:02:28.860> there

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
coming here so you could go over there

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.620 
coming here so you could go over there
and<00:02:29.100> build<00:02:29.340> some<00:02:29.430> defensive<00:02:29.940> structures<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
and build some defensive structures and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.060 
and build some defensive structures and
you<00:02:30.959> know<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.140> could<00:02:31.320> kind<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> corral<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
you know you could kind of corral the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.860 
you know you could kind of corral the
Zerg<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:33.000> know<00:02:33.090> there's<00:02:33.269> really<00:02:33.420> no<00:02:33.600> wrong

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
Zerg so you know there's really no wrong

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.539 
Zerg so you know there's really no wrong
way<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.200> play<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.070> how<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.340> want

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
a little bit on the editor side of how

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
a little bit on the editor side of how
we<00:02:41.220> did<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.489> world<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> reasons

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
we did this world and one of the reasons

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.479 
we did this world and one of the reasons
we<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> show<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.709> particular<00:02:44.160> world<00:02:44.310> is

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
we want to show this particular world is

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.070 
we want to show this particular world is
it's<00:02:44.820> very<00:02:44.940> different<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> last<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:46.019> I

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
it's very different from the last one I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.539 
it's very different from the last one I
just<00:02:46.110> showed<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.440> last<00:02:46.680> ones<00:02:46.950> very<00:02:47.130> hostile

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
just showed you last ones very hostile

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.520 
just showed you last ones very hostile
it's<00:02:47.820> got<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.450> got<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> lava<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.350> just

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
it's got the it's got the lava it's just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.560 
it's got the it's got the lava it's just
really<00:02:49.830> scary<00:02:50.040> looking<00:02:50.700> whereas<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.330> one's

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
really scary looking whereas this one's

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.810 
really scary looking whereas this one's
very<00:02:51.660> lush<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.100> farm<00:02:53.370> community

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
very lush it's it's a farm community

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.520 
very lush it's it's a farm community
it's<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.299> beautiful<00:02:54.480> planet<00:02:54.989> lots<00:02:55.350> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
it's a really beautiful planet lots of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's a really beautiful planet lots of
green<00:02:55.739> lots<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.130> vegetation<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
green lots of vegetation and so the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.379 
green lots of vegetation and so the
thing<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.739> new<00:02:59.100> for<00:02:59.310> us<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.730> starcraft<00:03:00.239> 2

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
thing that is new for us in starcraft 2

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.440 
thing that is new for us in starcraft 2
which<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.720> didn't<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:00.989> before<00:03:01.079> is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
which we didn't have before is

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.390 
which we didn't have before is
their<00:03:02.599> prior<00:03:02.840> previous<00:03:03.530> games<00:03:03.739> at<00:03:03.950> starcraft

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
their prior previous games at starcraft

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.010 
their prior previous games at starcraft
brood<00:03:04.700> war<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.180> war<00:03:05.330> cry<00:03:05.510> 3<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.900> all

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
brood war and war cry 3 is all

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.900 
brood war and war cry 3 is all
tile-based<00:03:06.319> sand<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.040> had<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> tendency<00:03:07.550> to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
tile-based sand so you had a tendency to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.759 
tile-based sand so you had a tendency to
see<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.569> hard<00:03:08.810> edges<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.319> textures<00:03:09.680> you

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
see the hard edges of the textures you

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.290 
see the hard edges of the textures you
can<00:03:09.890> see<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.129> dark<00:03:10.340> texture<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:10.819> next<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
can see the dark texture is next to the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.180 
can see the dark texture is next to the
light<00:03:11.510> textures<00:03:11.989> where<00:03:12.530> what<00:03:12.709> we<00:03:12.830> have<00:03:12.980> now<00:03:13.160> is

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
light textures where what we have now is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.240 
light textures where what we have now is
a<00:03:13.610> alpha<00:03:14.360> blending<00:03:14.569> texture<00:03:15.379> system<00:03:15.800> where

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
a alpha blending texture system where

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.339 
a alpha blending texture system where
you<00:03:16.430> can<00:03:16.580> actually<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:17.090> blend<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.989> textures

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
you can actually now blend the textures

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.920 
you can actually now blend the textures
together<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.340> end<00:03:20.000> result<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.540> basically

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
together and the end result is basically

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.470 
together and the end result is basically
as<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.530> paint<00:03:21.739> your<00:03:21.920> map<00:03:22.130> nope<00:03:22.849> two<00:03:23.060> parts<00:03:23.390> of

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
as you paint your map nope two parts of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.580 
as you paint your map nope two parts of
the<00:03:23.540> map<00:03:23.750> are<00:03:23.930> going<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.110> actually<00:03:24.200> look<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
the map are going to actually look the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.830 
the map are going to actually look the
same<00:03:24.769> as<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.459> however<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.269> want<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.660> blend

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
same as going however you want to blend

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.420 
same as going however you want to blend
these<00:03:26.930> textures<00:03:27.319> and<00:03:27.650> make<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.010> look<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.310> way

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
these textures and make the look the way

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.309 
these textures and make the look the way
you<00:03:28.459> want<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.760> do<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.120> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:32.319> and

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
you want to do it is kind of to you and

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.420 
you want to do it is kind of to you and

guys could go crazy with it you know and

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.140 
guys could go crazy with it you know and
basically<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.549> little<00:03:58.790> picture<00:03:58.910> right<00:03:59.120> here

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
basically this little picture right here

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.509 
basically this little picture right here
is<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.360> illustration<00:04:00.019> as<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:01.400> know<00:04:01.430> I

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
is the illustration as to you know I

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.920 
is the illustration as to you know I
kind<00:04:01.819> of<00:04:01.940> torque<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.299> road<00:04:02.450> out<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:02.720> there<00:04:02.810> to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
kind of torque the road out of there to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.180 
kind of torque the road out of there to
kind<00:04:03.079> of<00:04:03.110> point<00:04:03.290> out<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.829> is<00:04:04.010> just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
kind of point out that this is just

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.870 
kind of point out that this is just
something<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.579> can<00:04:04.730> do<00:04:04.819> on<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> fly<00:04:06.819> one<00:04:07.819> of

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
something you can do on the fly one of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.670 
something you can do on the fly one of
the<00:04:07.970> other<00:04:08.090> things<00:04:08.150> that's<00:04:08.600> new<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.319> us<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.620> is

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the other things that's new to us and is

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.680 
the other things that's new to us and is
very<00:04:09.859> exciting<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.760> Train<00:04:11.030> foliage<00:04:11.450> and

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
very exciting is the Train foliage and

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.199 
very exciting is the Train foliage and
this<00:04:12.500> kind<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:12.829> works<00:04:13.100> with<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.519> texturing

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
this kind of works with the texturing

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.840 
this kind of works with the texturing
and<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.900> way<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.230> works<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.769> based<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:16.669> the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
and the way this works is based on the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.670 
and the way this works is based on the
textures<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.329> you're<00:04:17.660> using<00:04:17.900> on<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.470> map

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
textures that you're using on the map

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.800 
textures that you're using on the map
that<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.489> could<00:04:19.639> generate<00:04:20.000> doodads<00:04:20.479> for

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
that you could generate doodads for

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.360 
that you could generate doodads for
those<00:04:20.930> textures<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.799> so<00:04:22.010> in<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:22.220> particular

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
those textures and so in this particular

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.760 
those textures and so in this particular
picture<00:04:22.820> I've<00:04:23.210> using<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.050> dark<00:04:24.260> green<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:24.740> you

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
picture I've using the dark green so you

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.500 
picture I've using the dark green so you
got<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:24.979> tall<00:04:25.190> grass<00:04:25.460> blades<00:04:25.789> but<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
got the tall grass blades but this is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.760 
got the tall grass blades but this is
something<00:04:26.840> that's<00:04:26.930> just<00:04:27.050> generated

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
something that's just generated

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.159 
something that's just generated
automatically<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.729> kind<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:29.169> how

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
automatically and you can kind of how

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.810 
automatically and you can kind of how
dense<00:04:30.560> do<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.800> want<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.100> grass<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.430> be<00:04:31.460> or<00:04:31.669> how

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
dense do you want the grass to be or how

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.300 
dense do you want the grass to be or how
sparse<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.450> it's<00:04:32.570> kind<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.780> up<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.380> so

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
sparse and it's kind of up to you and so

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.550 
sparse and it's kind of up to you and so
the<00:04:34.729> ultimate<00:04:35.210> effect<00:04:35.330> is<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.960> really<00:04:36.260> helps

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
the ultimate effect is it really helps

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.340 
the ultimate effect is it really helps
give<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> 3d<00:04:37.310> look<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.690> whole<00:04:38.840> map<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.200> just

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
give a 3d look to the whole map it just

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.960 
give a 3d look to the whole map it just
makes<00:04:39.500> everything<00:04:39.620> snap<00:04:40.130> together<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.820> just

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
makes everything snap together and just

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.390 
makes everything snap together and just
a<00:04:41.120> really<00:04:41.630> beautiful<00:04:41.990> beautiful<00:04:42.800> final

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400
