see<00:03:11.090> everything<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.769> want<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.980> turn<00:03:13.069> it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
see everything so you want to turn it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.470 
see everything so you want to turn it
clockwise<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.959> there<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.319> go<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:17.269> show

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
clockwise and there we go just to show

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.690 
clockwise and there we go just to show
you<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.959> can<00:03:18.109> turn<00:03:18.859> this<00:03:19.069> thing<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.579> works

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
you you can turn this thing and it works

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.180 
you you can turn this thing and it works
just<00:03:20.269> as<00:03:20.389> well<00:03:20.420> -<00:03:20.780> oh<00:03:21.910> there<00:03:22.910> we<00:03:23.030> are

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
just as well - oh there we are

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.099 
just as well - oh there we are
well<00:03:25.190> sort<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.639> there<00:03:26.600> we<00:03:26.720> go

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
well sort of there we go

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.990 
well sort of there we go
isn't<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.709> nice<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.280> think<00:03:28.639> that's<00:03:28.910> an

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
isn't that nice I think that's an

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.520 
isn't that nice I think that's an
awesome<00:03:29.180> construction<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.079> they<00:03:30.200> got<00:03:30.349> here

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
awesome construction that they got here

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.099 
awesome construction that they got here
and<00:03:31.519> with<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.880> said<00:03:32.120> let's<00:03:32.480> move<00:03:32.660> on<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
and with that said let's move on to the

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.250 
and with that said let's move on to the
recommendations<00:03:37.630> overall<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.959> great

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
recommendations overall this is a great

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.960 
recommendations overall this is a great
set<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:40.010> definitely<00:03:40.370> recommend<00:03:40.609> getting

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
set and I definitely recommend getting

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.610 
set and I definitely recommend getting
it<00:03:41.150> when<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.810> comes<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.170> value<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.590> a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
it when it comes to the value have a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.409 
it when it comes to the value have a
price<00:03:42.889> per<00:03:43.040> piece<00:03:43.220> ratio<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.790> nine<00:03:44.030> cents<00:03:44.299> per

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
price per piece ratio of nine cents per

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.390 
price per piece ratio of nine cents per
piece<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.019> according<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.799> bring<00:03:45.980> link<00:03:46.160> we're

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
piece and according to bring link we're

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.830 
piece and according to bring link we're
getting<00:03:46.700> about<00:03:46.819> thirty<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.450> forty<00:03:47.750> dollars

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
getting about thirty to forty dollars

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.930 
getting about thirty to forty dollars
for<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.200> parts<00:03:48.440> here<00:03:48.680> which<00:03:49.400> seems<00:03:49.730> like<00:03:49.910> a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
for the parts here which seems like a

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.000 
for the parts here which seems like a
lot<00:03:50.180> because<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:50.720> set<00:03:50.959> only<00:03:51.139> retails<00:03:51.560> for<00:03:51.620> 20

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
lot because this set only retails for 20

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.309 
lot because this set only retails for 20
and<00:03:52.130> it's<00:03:52.790> mainly<00:03:52.940> because<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.389> this<00:03:54.049> part

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
and it's mainly because of this part

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.280 
and it's mainly because of this part
right<00:03:54.410> here<00:03:54.700> each<00:03:55.700> one<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> these<00:03:56.150> goals<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.900> 4

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
right here each one of these goals for 4

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.680 
right here each one of these goals for 4
bucks<00:03:57.590> each<00:03:57.859> so<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.209> two<00:03:59.329> of<00:03:59.419> them<00:03:59.540> here

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
bucks each so you have two of them here

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.759 
bucks each so you have two of them here
the<00:03:59.840> drum<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.200> like<00:04:00.319> we're<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:00.560> eight<00:04:00.620> dollars

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
the drum is like we're for eight dollars

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.009 
the drum is like we're for eight dollars
right<00:04:01.099> there<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.430> it's<00:04:02.359> mainly<00:04:02.510> because<00:04:02.690> it's

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
right there and it's mainly because it's

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.289 
right there and it's mainly because it's
an<00:04:03.230> exclusive<00:04:03.590> part<00:04:04.069> to<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.310> set<00:04:04.549> along<00:04:05.120> this

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
an exclusive part to this set along this

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.120 
an exclusive part to this set along this
yellow<00:04:05.510> panel<00:04:05.840> right<00:04:05.959> here<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.799> when<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.010> comes

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
yellow panel right here so when it comes

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.979 
yellow panel right here so when it comes
to<00:04:07.280> parts<00:04:07.609> it's<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.359> bad<00:04:08.569> actually

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
to parts it's not bad actually

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.220 
to parts it's not bad actually
and<00:04:10.269> what<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.299> also<00:04:11.450> like<00:04:11.630> about<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:11.959> set<00:04:12.200> is

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
and what I also like about this set is

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.539 
and what I also like about this set is
that<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.620> actually<00:04:12.980> learned<00:04:13.280> something<00:04:13.340> new

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
that I actually learned something new

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.819 
that I actually learned something new
for<00:04:13.849> this<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:15.109> may<00:04:15.230> not<00:04:15.380> seem<00:04:15.530> like<00:04:15.560> much

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
for this one it may not seem like much

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.740 
for this one it may not seem like much
but<00:04:15.889> I<00:04:16.130> thought<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.400> was<00:04:16.489> interesting<00:04:16.669> if<00:04:17.599> you

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
but I thought it was interesting if you

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.210 
but I thought it was interesting if you
look<00:04:17.870> at<00:04:17.959> how<00:04:18.019> they<00:04:18.139> made<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.410> mechanism<00:04:18.919> for

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
look at how they made the mechanism for

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.190 
look at how they made the mechanism for
the<00:04:19.340> drum<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:20.150> can<00:04:20.209> see<00:04:20.450> that<00:04:20.630> they<00:04:20.840> used<00:04:21.260> a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the drum you can see that they used a

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.360 
the drum you can see that they used a
turntable<00:04:24.200> right<00:04:24.320> there<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.130> reason<00:04:25.310> why

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
turntable right there and the reason why

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.180 
turntable right there and the reason why
they<00:04:25.490> use<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.390> doesn't<00:04:26.719> cause

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
they use that so that it doesn't cause

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.370 
they use that so that it doesn't cause
you<00:04:27.280> pause<00:04:27.490> with<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.330> end<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> axle

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
you pause with this end of the axle

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.050 
you pause with this end of the axle
piece<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.250> still<00:04:30.400> allows<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.700> move<00:04:30.820> freely

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
piece and it still allows it move freely

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.460 
piece and it still allows it move freely
and<00:04:31.210> nothing<00:04:31.570> gets<00:04:31.750> caught<00:04:31.960> not<00:04:32.260> though<00:04:32.380> it's

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
and nothing gets caught not though it's

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.110 
and nothing gets caught not though it's
pretty<00:04:32.560> interesting<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.640> really<00:04:33.790> handy

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
pretty interesting and it's really handy

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.760 
pretty interesting and it's really handy
if<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.480> want<00:04:34.510> any<00:04:34.780> axle<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.260> stay<00:04:35.410> in<00:04:35.470> place

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
if you want any axle to stay in place

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.770 
if you want any axle to stay in place
because<00:04:36.760> that's<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.120> axle<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.630> used

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
because that's what that axle is used

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.410 
because that's what that axle is used
for<00:04:37.960> but<00:04:38.560> anyway<00:04:38.890> when<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.850> comes<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.090> playback

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
for but anyway when it comes to playback

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.520 
for but anyway when it comes to playback
I<00:04:40.480> think<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:40.810> really<00:04:40.930> good<00:04:41.110> too<00:04:41.290> it's

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
I think this is really good too it's

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.100 
I think this is really good too it's
definitely<00:04:41.890> fun<00:04:42.040> for<00:04:42.220> all<00:04:42.250> ages<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.870> think

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
definitely fun for all ages and I think

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.360
