00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
 i chose kieft paulson and the romario in the rush hour 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.930
 stories and vanenburg proved to be sufficiently fit in the last training session yesterday 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.930
 to start as spanish players 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.439
 due to the attacks the composition of psv leo leg hacker chose a bit 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.329
 more defensive team 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.480
 mark Verkuijl pointed out her Achilles tendon injury 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.759
 he is in the base and jan wauters plays in midfield 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.599
 you i would say and the hungarian international office 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.599
 she is sitting on the couch again 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 free kick ajax 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.940
 behind month's requirements 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 not the project 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.040
 kao is already moving to bin hammam to cut the road 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.420
 Berlin 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 Nothing is less true 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.550
 Horn 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 where the yard 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.400
 romario 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.490
 remarkably often comes from the peak spot than blind with it 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.220
 Mario Bear is now the front man 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 together with kieft 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 news one opts for the nice solution 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.270
 it was already at the cover but does not get the ball from a bump 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.900
 Ajax started in midfield because of a solution 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900
 Piet's surprising victory of vanenburg of the reds 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.950
 those are the moments 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.000
 on which perhaps something can happen for the rest, it will be until now 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.709
 to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 the reds that suddenly comes in 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.559
 but without it she finds it cheaper in the front 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.559
 there is low sand 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 beautiful free kick from bryan roy 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 evade 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.219
 has to deal with lerby 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.069
 for the discount rule clock was from blankenstein 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.069
 shot blocked the red 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.000
 weather reports finds itself 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.139
 that indicates that ajax 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.919
 more and more enters the competition then it's tick 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.919
 that's a larsson 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.959
 valuesburg defended and that says enough 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.379
 he shows Ajax in this phase of the Brugges match or six and seven before half time 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.599
 more balance of psv 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.599
 gerets in your pocket 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.139
 at the kneecap temporary 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.859
 midfield if I am weak at psv 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.489
 that has enough manpower for 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.249
 but they have been approved so far 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.169
 almost romario 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.379
 a moment of those brazilians 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.329
 may be sufficient 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.819
 typically the lightning rod 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.819
 larsson became mainly mario 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.249
 more than a minute in the first half 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.590
 that is on points for ajax 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.590
 after a good start of PSV 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 psv is back en masse 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.319
 and even romario must co-defend 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.930
 their position 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.930
 but don't ask Ronald the farmer 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.860
 who based on the top match against Ajax 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.599
 would have been before 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.650
 he gets the ball blind against the hand 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.650
 Woman Penn put ballin a meter away 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.650
 van fracture drag psv through it
