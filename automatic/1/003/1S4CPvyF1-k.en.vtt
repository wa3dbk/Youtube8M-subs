this<00:00:11.599> is<00:00:11.809> from<00:00:12.019> my<00:00:12.170> cell<00:00:12.469> phone<00:00:12.500> so<00:00:12.980> let's<00:00:13.160> hope

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:25.240 
this is from my cell phone so let's hope
it<00:00:13.459> works

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:37.560 

now<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.449> is<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.710> park

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.160 

but<00:00:38.170> we'll<00:00:38.350> do<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.890> change<00:00:39.310> it<00:00:39.430> over<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:40.750> check

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
but we'll do is change it over to check

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:52.920 
but we'll do is change it over to check
my<00:00:41.410> rail<00:00:42.280> pressure

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.939 

so<00:00:53.590> my<00:00:53.710> desire<00:00:53.890> is<00:00:54.400> 34

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
so my desire is 34

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.100 
so my desire is 34
my<00:00:57.100> actual

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
my actual

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:11.270 
my actual
it's<00:00:59.500> jumping<00:00:59.920> around<00:01:00.040> quite<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.520> bit

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.120 

let's<00:01:12.280> open<00:01:12.430> up<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.880> window<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.770> hear<00:01:14.980> how

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
let's open up the window you hear how

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:35.810 
let's open up the window you hear how
the<00:01:15.190> truck<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.610> idling

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:57.010 

does

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.109 

I'm<00:01:57.500> thinking<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.219> fuel<00:01:58.490> pressure

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
I'm thinking it's the fuel pressure

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.899 
I'm thinking it's the fuel pressure
regulator

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.439 

I'd<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.539> to<00:02:02.659> know<00:02:02.780> what<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:02.990> guys<00:02:03.170> think
