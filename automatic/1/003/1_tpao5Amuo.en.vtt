purple perk it's completely different to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.200 
purple perk it's completely different to
the<00:00:45.960> actual<00:00:46.739> ray<00:00:47.039> gun<00:00:47.250> shot<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:47.969> showing

right<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.450> um<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.590> different<00:00:50.010> than<00:00:50.129> they

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
right now um it's different than they

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
right now um it's different than they
flame<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:51.030> actual<00:00:51.270> perma<00:00:51.539> perk<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.289> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
flame it's an actual perma perk so this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
flame it's an actual perma perk so this
is<00:00:53.010> completely<00:00:53.460> new<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.840> only

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is completely new because the only

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
is completely new because the only
partner<00:00:55.530> /<00:00:55.710> he<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.160> while<00:00:56.370> shooting<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
partner / he can get while shooting is

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.349 
partner / he can get while shooting is
the<00:00:57.390> headshot<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.000> he<00:01:00.000> didn't<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the headshot one and I he didn't get a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you get enough um splash damage from

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
you get enough um splash damage from
this<00:01:15.990> gun<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> does<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.950> splash<00:01:17.189> damage

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
this gun if it does have splash damage

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
this can't be any other thing or a perma

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
this can't be any other thing or a perma
perk<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.670> already<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.689> ones<00:01:36.869> we
