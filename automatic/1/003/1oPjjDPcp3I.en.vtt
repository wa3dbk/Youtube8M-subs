00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello fantastic how about in this video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.970
 I'll show you how to make some roses 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.910
 of tissue like these that you see in this 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.210
 ship of roses this ship is the ship of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.210
 my wedding 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.759
 It's made entirely by hand I've done it 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:28.040
 I using fabrics and antique lace 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.650
 and old ones that my grandmother had left me 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.629
 so it is very special to me 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.199
 so if you want to know how they are made 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:40.730
 or pinkies like that 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.730
 you just need to see this tutorial 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.769
 let's see the materials you will need 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.680
 silicon gun a piece of the loop of 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.810
 tape like this 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:57.830
 If you want accessories for fake flowers 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:03.040
 like these but it's not necessary and 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.040
 also wire and florist ribbon 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.160
 what you have to do now is put 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.790
 a little silicon with a gun 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.480
 silicone to your tape and fold in this 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.940
 way so that a triangle forms and 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.540
 this triangle again you have to 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.360
 fold it with some silicone light 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.100
 forming a smaller triangle in 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.470
 this way 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.470
 and now it rolls everything 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:38.310
 put another bit of silicon but very little 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.310
 and on the roll 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.490
 now for the other little bit of silicon and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.939
 fold the ribbon again 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.670
 until you reach this point at this point 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.720
 what you have to do is simply 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.220
 roll and fold roll and fold and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.310
 every time you go to roll you have to 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.970
 put a silicon tip on this 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 way is super simple and it's simpler 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.140
 see what to explain then I leave you 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.140
 see the images 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.420
 and your rose is ready 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.390
 Now you can cut the excess and 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.520
 use your rose for decorations like 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.280
 is 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.410
 or you can make a stem using 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.410
 wire in this way 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.370
 so let's see how the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.720
 stem 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.840
 take a piece of wire and a piece of 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.360
 florist flower ribbon like this that 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.510
 it is a paper tape a little gummed 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.360
 and you just have to 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.319
 and put it in this way 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.319
 around your wire 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.940
 then roll up the well 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.940
 all over the piece of your wire 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.079
 and your stem is ready now you only have 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.010
 to put a little silicone with 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.639
 silicone gun and paste it 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.370
 in this way to the rose 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:37.830
 using the portion of the leftover 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.830
 woven in this way 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.880
 and now to cover the excess just 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:56.650
 You have to take a piece of this 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:00.729
 green ribbon and put it around the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:05.610
 left over from the rose in this way 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.610
 and also around the stem 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.860
 and if you want you can use accessories 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.159
 for flowers for fake flowers like this 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.780
 little leaf like that and put some silicon 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.570
 and roll it up 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.040
 around the rose and there is your rose 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.040
 list and wonderful 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.110
 let's see another method to make roses 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.130
 then take another piece of tape 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.920
 bend it and form a 90 degree angle 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:57.360
 In this way 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.610
 now cross the part on the right towards 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.990
 the left 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.840
 well and the left side up 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.039
 in this way you have to cross the two 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.400
 the parties and keep crossing the in this 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:18.590
 way until you get a way like 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.590
 of accordion like this 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.160
 now grab the stones well and grab 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:30.790
 one of the two 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.740
 I wish the other one in this way and as well as 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.740
 you see the rose is forming 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.169
 Y 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.490
 and here is your pink list and you only have 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.920
 to do it a little bit on the part of 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.580
 down and you're ready for your 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.580
 decorations 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:05.529
