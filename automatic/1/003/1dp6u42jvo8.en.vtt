thinking<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.879> Watford<00:00:54.680> recently<00:00:55.680> where<00:00:55.860> they

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
thinking of Watford recently where they

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
thinking of Watford recently where they
could<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.309> had<00:00:56.460> three<00:00:56.699> points<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.210> didn't

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
could have had three points and didn't

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.000 
could have had three points and didn't
maybe<00:00:57.660> deserve<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.320> three<00:00:58.559> points<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
maybe deserve to have three points and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
maybe deserve to have three points and
didn't<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> today<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.449> didn't<00:01:00.809> deserve

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
didn't get it today they didn't deserve

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.799 
didn't get it today they didn't deserve
one<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.430> got<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
one what actually got one and that's the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.570 
one what actually got one and that's the
way<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> isn't<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.979> I've<00:01:05.129> been<00:01:05.159> saying

such a tight race but they're in they're
fighting<00:01:35.100> they're<00:01:35.400> still<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.090> fighting

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
fighting they're still in there fighting

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
fighting they're still in there fighting
before<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.079> start<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> season<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.979> thought

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
before the start of season I thought

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
before the start of season I thought
they'd<00:01:38.610> finish<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.060> six<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:40.200> looking<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
they'd finish top six it's looking that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
they'd finish top six it's looking that
way<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> case<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.299> was

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
way so if that's the case and that was

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
way so if that's the case and that was
the<00:01:42.659> aim<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.950> course<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the aim then you're on course to do that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
the aim then you're on course to do that
because<00:01:45.030> plenty<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.600> frustration<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
because plenty of frustration about a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.780 
because plenty of frustration about a
lot<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> booze<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> end<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> game

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
which is unusual here fans yo are

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.980 
which is unusual here fans yo are
you<00:01:52.090> know<00:01:52.180> they<00:01:52.330> can<00:01:52.480> have<00:01:52.630> their<00:01:52.660> say

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
you know they can have their say

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.980 
you know they can have their say
absolutely<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:55.300> was<00:01:55.390> talk<00:01:55.600> also<00:01:55.840> about

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
absolutely but it was talk also about

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.230 
absolutely but it was talk also about
your<00:01:56.410> lack<00:01:56.680> of<00:01:56.710> desire<00:01:56.980> like<00:01:57.430> effort<00:01:57.820> it's<00:01:58.030> not

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
your lack of desire like effort it's not

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.260 
your lack of desire like effort it's not
about<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:59.290> doesn't<00:01:59.620> enter<00:02:00.220> into<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.520> it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
about that that doesn't enter into it it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.390 
about that that doesn't enter into it it
looks<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:01.870> that<00:02:02.110> because<00:02:02.350> confidence<00:02:03.190> is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
looks like that because confidence is

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.090 
looks like that because confidence is
low<00:02:03.460> tens<00:02:04.360> plenty<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.900> tension<00:02:05.350> involved<00:02:05.890> and
