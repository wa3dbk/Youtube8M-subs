I've done taking that bath in epsom salt

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.080 
I've done taking that bath in epsom salt
and<00:05:14.599> my<00:05:15.260> skin<00:05:15.530> feels<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.860> lot<00:05:15.979> tighter<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.789> it

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
and my skin feels a lot tighter and it

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.000 
and my skin feels a lot tighter and it
seems<00:05:17.510> like<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.780> water<00:05:18.020> has<00:05:18.199> been<00:05:18.380> drawn<00:05:18.770> out

seems like the water has been drawn out

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.110 
seems like the water has been drawn out
and<00:05:19.250> then<00:05:19.909> when<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> cut<00:05:20.599> that<00:05:20.780> water

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
and then when you cut that water

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.330 
and then when you cut that water
I<00:05:22.180> think<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:22.930> it<00:05:23.110> helps<00:05:23.290> out<00:05:23.590> with<00:05:23.770> your<00:05:24.100> skin
