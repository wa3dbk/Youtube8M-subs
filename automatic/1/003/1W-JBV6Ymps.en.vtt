00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.930
 eternal dilemma nikon or canon has received a new field for sports canon 6d 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.519
 and nikon d600 full-frame SLR entry-level in our today's 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.910
 review 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.350
 for starters, we carefully look at the experimental nikon look more 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.460
 massive yes and the camera weighs 100 grams more than the opponent of the main external 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.990
 the differences are much more advanced ergonomics nikon extra keys 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.090
 next to the screen are three programmable buttons all like the more expensive cameras 6 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.190
 babes and can not boast he is more like an older brother 60d and of course 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570
 additional buttons are not enough to quickly change the white balance picture style or 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.440
 The focus point is all important, and Nikon seems to know about this, which is not 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.450
 say about Kan still striking lack of 6 where the flash though as we 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.180
 it seems she is here and does not need any of the class of cameras 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 and that's what really matters two memory card slots hold the second card 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.160
 can be used for backup or just start here 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.240
 photos are stored after filling in the first one; you can still save it to the first one 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.310
 map slave shots on the second jpeg so it is on just one slot so here too 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.270
 the advantage is not on his side both cameras are often very equipped 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.670
 claimed silent shutter function 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.950
 but u canon she works on order effectively 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.920
 also both cameras are equipped with a fine lens adjustment system 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.270
 adult DSLRs note and more perfect display 6 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.100
 it is slightly smaller on the diagonal resolution is higher for purely tactile sensations nikon 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.549
 seems more impressive and massive but in a long walk or 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.009
 the journey we'd rather take the 6 day size and less weight here will come in handy 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.689
 Now let's move on to the camera’s insides, let's start with the matrix despite the same 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.979
 Nikon size placed on it for 4 million pixels more 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.240
 the rate of fire is 600 over 5 5 frames per second against 4 and 5 and 6 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.950
 when shooting raw books, he can take a series of a maximum of 14 shots and then another 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.200
 16 shots at two frames per second canon makes just 16 frames but this is not true 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.940
 important the main difference between cameras autofocus in canon is unclear why they decided that 11 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.299
 focus points are enough for a four-frame full-frame camera 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.000
 Nikon's price tag did not save on this and supplied de 600 with a class of 39 to pinpoint 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.350
 autofocus to his work there is absolutely no complaints about us is also excellent 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.160
 copes with the focus but still for shooting fast-moving objects nikon 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.090
 look preferable as far as from a canon looks better true 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.260
 significant differences in quality occur after 5000 hours of attack and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.459
 the value is not used very often and the maximum value from windows 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.190
 much more true quality losses become palpable 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.640
 Another important parameter is the dynamic range of cameras by tests of a respected 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.049
 many of the portal de expo mark they have small values ​​of iso range above a 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.870
 after 1600 canon shows consistently higher results now let's 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.590
 Let us turn to the video capabilities of the cameras if we just notice it here. 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.159
 advantage picture issued 6 where is better in all respects 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.970
 about the possibility of recording with compression oh-oh will be appreciated by those who during installation do 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.120
 deep color correction with moire moody 600 things are a little better though both 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.799
 cameras are far from the current 5-inch reference 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.000
 bring except uncompensated hdmi signal and headphone jack and wow 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.829
 we lack the main feature of the 6 built-in Wi-Fi and 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.819
 DPS transmitters with red-handed experience let's say that this is very convenient and useful. 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.510
 functions can now finally be photographed with family without any problems 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.319
 think about who got in the frame and who is not and also remote control of the camera 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.540
 useful for those who take long exposures 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.690
 owners of 6 where the release cables are no longer needed 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.560
 in the end, what we get as a camera nikon d600 is a little better, but if you 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.580
 You need to shoot often with a lack of lighting or video, then 6d is uniquely 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.630
 better water nikon is more suitable for reportage shooting while it’s on you 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.740
 the ideal choice for travelers here will be felt and light weight and size 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.080
 and gps and dustproof and waterproof case
