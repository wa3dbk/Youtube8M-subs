00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.330 
to get rid of that unwanted land that
people<00:00:12.090> get<00:00:12.530> I'm<00:00:13.530> just<00:00:13.860> doing<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.309> a

people get I'm just doing this as a
quick<00:00:14.580> video<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.150> really<00:00:15.389> easy<00:00:15.509> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
quick video because it's really easy to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.680 
quick video because it's really easy to
do<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.289> people<00:00:16.680> always<00:00:17.160> seem<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.990 
do but people always seem to not get it
right<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.800> there's<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> couple<00:00:20.789> steps

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
right because there's a couple steps

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750 
right because there's a couple steps
that<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.390> need<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.109> order<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.580> get<00:00:23.580> rid

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
that you need to do in order to get rid

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.179 
that you need to do in order to get rid
of<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.939> unwanted<00:00:24.869> land<00:00:25.380> that's<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.830> front<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
of that unwanted land that's in front of

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.960 
of that unwanted land that's in front of
the<00:00:26.250> trenches<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> keep<00:00:29.460> getting<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> lot<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the trenches so I keep getting a lot of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
the trenches so I keep getting a lot of
requests<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.140> decided<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
requests on this so I decided to make a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.729 
requests on this so I decided to make a
video<00:00:31.890> today<00:00:32.160> since<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:32.910> time<00:00:33.739> any

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
video today since I have some time any

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.060 
video today since I have some time any
so<00:00:35.610> let's<00:00:36.090> begin<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.680> anything<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.860> goes

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so let's begin with anything that goes

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.360 
so let's begin with anything that goes
in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> ground<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:39.090> trenches<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.870> example

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
in the ground like trenches for example

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
in the ground like trenches for example
they<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.940> placed<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.390> f2<00:00:42.600> mode<00:00:43.020> always

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
they have to be placed in f2 mode always

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.319 
they have to be placed in f2 mode always
have<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:43.980> f2<00:00:44.219> mode<00:00:44.399> make<00:00:44.730> sure<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
have to be an f2 mode make sure so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
have to be an f2 mode make sure so
that's<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.750> important<00:00:46.289> remember<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.860> this

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that's very important remember this this

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
that's very important remember this this
always<00:00:47.520> has<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.820> placed<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> mode<00:00:48.719> as

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
always has to be placed in up to mode as

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
always has to be placed in up to mode as
you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.680> now<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> am<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> f2<00:00:50.579> mode<00:00:51.030> by

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you can see right now I am in f2 mode by

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.340 
you can see right now I am in f2 mode by
doing<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.780> f3<00:00:53.510> you'll<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> problem<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
doing an f3 you'll get the problem of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.979 
doing an f3 you'll get the problem of
you<00:00:55.590> can't<00:00:55.920> select<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> track<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.480> move<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you can't select the track and move it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
you can't select the track and move it
or<00:00:58.170> anything<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.129> make<00:00:59.309> sure

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
or anything like that so make sure

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
or anything like that so make sure
you're<00:00:59.579> doing<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.910> too<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.359> actually

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you're doing that too you can actually

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
you're doing that too you can actually
move<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> objects<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> redefine<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.760> know

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
move the objects and redefine and know

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
move the objects and redefine and know
whatever<00:01:03.830> okay<00:01:05.930> obviously<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.680> you're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
whatever okay obviously when you're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
whatever okay obviously when you're
placing<00:01:07.979> together<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.790> lanes<00:01:09.150> still<00:01:09.330> going

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
placing together the lanes still going

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
placing together the lanes still going
to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.770> because

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
to be there but that's that's because

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
to be there but that's that's because
we're<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.310> done<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:12.960> placing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
we're not done now so now when placing

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.350 
we're not done now so now when placing
the<00:01:13.439> trenches<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.430> correctly<00:01:14.760> place<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the trenches to correctly place them is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
the trenches to correctly place them is
you<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> put<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.020> obviously<00:01:16.500> really

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you got to put them obviously really

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.960 
you got to put them obviously really
close<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> each<00:01:17.130> other<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
close to each other you don't have to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.280 
close to each other you don't have to
put<00:01:18.119> them<00:01:18.210> inside<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.689> each<00:01:18.780> other<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> make

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
put them inside of each other just make

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.429 
put them inside of each other just make
sure<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> infantry<00:01:20.850> trenches<00:01:21.439> like

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
sure like for the infantry trenches like

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.740 
sure like for the infantry trenches like
the<00:01:23.220> wood<00:01:23.460> make<00:01:23.909> sure<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.299> they're<00:01:24.479> just

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the wood make sure like they're just

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
the wood make sure like they're just
quickly<00:01:25.049> touching<00:01:25.590> each<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:27.799> say<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.040> like

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
quickly touching each other say for like

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.359 
quickly touching each other say for like
you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:30.079> anti-tank<00:01:31.079> trenches<00:01:31.590> or<00:01:31.979> tank

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you know anti-tank trenches or tank

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
you know anti-tank trenches or tank
trenches<00:01:32.750> trenches<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> come<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> pieces

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
trenches trenches that come in to pieces

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
trenches trenches that come in to pieces
like<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.450> put<00:01:36.869> together

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
like this also have to be put together

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.109 
like this also have to be put together
like<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> puzzle<00:01:37.530> piece<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> infantry

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
like a puzzle piece like the infantry

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
like a puzzle piece like the infantry
trenches<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:41.420> um<00:01:42.420> again<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.159> have

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
trenches do um again just you don't have

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
trenches do um again just you don't have
to<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.549> inside<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> other<00:01:45.570> object<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to go inside of the other object just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010 
to go inside of the other object just
make<00:01:46.290> sure<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.640> close<00:01:48.030> or<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
make sure it's just really close or it's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
make sure it's just really close or it's
overlapping<00:01:49.680> each<00:01:50.040> other<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.520> very

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
overlapping each other just very

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.359 
overlapping each other just very
slightly<00:01:52.430> for<00:01:53.430> shell<00:01:53.880> holes<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.479> craters<00:01:55.369> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
slightly for shell holes and craters you

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.380 
slightly for shell holes and craters you
don't<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.820> anything<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.299> these

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
don't have to do anything for these

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.300 
don't have to do anything for these
except<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> place<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.890> because

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
except you just have to place on because

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.249 
except you just have to place on because
obviously<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.180> put<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.540> together<00:02:00.719> or

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
obviously you don't put them together or

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.359 
obviously you don't put them together or
anything<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:01.950> place<00:02:02.250> them

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
anything like that you just place them

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
anything like that you just place them
and<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.020> okay<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.079> when<00:02:04.469> you've

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
satisfied in f2 mode when you're finally

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.779

done<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:06.930> all<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.229> placing<00:02:07.890> you're<00:02:08.640> going

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
done with all your placing you're going

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.279 
done with all your placing you're going

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to go to the top right and hit save as

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.040 
to go to the top right and hit save as
you're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> save<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> as<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.310> new<00:02:11.459> map

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
you're going to save it as a new map

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.240 
you're going to save it as a new map
when<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.170> hit<00:02:13.319> save<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.069> to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
when you hit save as it's going to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.340 
when you hit save as it's going to
we<00:02:14.400> load<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> map<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.420> as<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.260> can

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
we load the map for you and as you can

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.860 
we load the map for you and as you can
see<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:18.000> lines<00:02:18.180> still<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.720> but

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
see you know the lines still there but

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.090 
see you know the lines still there but
that's<00:02:19.020> because<00:02:19.140> we're<00:02:19.350> not<00:02:19.380> done<00:02:19.680> yet

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that's because we're not done yet

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's because we're not done yet
so<00:02:20.520> now<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:20.820> we're<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.360> want

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so now what we're going to do is we want

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
so now what we're going to do is we want
to<00:02:21.510> switch<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> f3<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.470> hit<00:02:22.860> save<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.580> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to switch to f3 and hit save as in this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:36.770 
to switch to f3 and hit save as in this
category<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.290> give<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.680> new<00:02:28.860> name<00:02:35.030> ok<00:02:36.030> so

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
category and give it a new name ok so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.150 
category and give it a new name ok so

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
now it's going to quickly save it and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.830 
now it's going to quickly save it and
it's<00:02:38.490> still<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.510> I'm<00:02:39.570> going<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.720> do

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
is we're going to go back to the top

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.570 
is we're going to go back to the top
right<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.370> hit<00:02:41.970> reload<00:02:42.860> when<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.010> hit<00:02:44.190> reload

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
right and hit reload when you hit reload

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.910 
right and hit reload when you hit reload
it<00:02:45.209> will<00:02:45.390> finally<00:02:45.870> give<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.350> finished

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it will finally give you the finished

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.650 
it will finally give you the finished
product<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.580> crunches<00:02:48.290> obviously<00:02:50.660> now

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
product of the crunches obviously now

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.410 
product of the crunches obviously now
like<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.230> saying<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.520> what<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> real

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
like I have saying so what a like a real

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.540 
like I have saying so what a like a real
I<00:02:54.690> go<00:02:54.750> what<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> reload<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:56.010> pretty<00:02:56.190> much<00:02:56.370> it

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
I go what a reload is is pretty much it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.360 
I go what a reload is is pretty much it
redefines<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.480> or<00:02:57.630> reconstructs<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> final

redefines it or reconstructs to a final

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.340 
redefines it or reconstructs to a final
form<00:02:59.640> or<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.300> final<00:03:00.630> product<00:03:01.020> because

form or to the final product because

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.610 
form or to the final product because
obviously<00:03:01.800> from<00:03:02.520> f2<00:03:02.970> mode<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.480> f3<00:03:04.020> mode<00:03:04.440> from

obviously from f2 mode in f3 mode from

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.360 
obviously from f2 mode in f3 mode from
before<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.130> hit<00:03:05.370> reload<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.709> land<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.100> going

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
before I hit reload the land was going

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.940 
before I hit reload the land was going
through<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:08.970> all<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.209> stuff<00:03:09.830> when<00:03:10.830> you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
through it and all that stuff when you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.440 
through it and all that stuff when you
hit<00:03:11.220> reload<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.730> gets<00:03:11.940> rid<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
that's not supposed to be there so

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.580 
that's not supposed to be there so
that's<00:03:18.180> what<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.570> problem<00:03:18.780> people<00:03:19.350> keep

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
that's what the problem people keep

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.009 
that's what the problem people keep
forgetting<00:03:20.040> when<00:03:20.190> making<00:03:20.370> their<00:03:20.580> trenches

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
forgetting when making their trenches

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.380 
forgetting when making their trenches
people<00:03:22.019> keep<00:03:22.260> getting<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.560> problem<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.390> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
people keep getting the problem that the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
land still there is but that's because

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.670 
land still there is but that's because
they<00:03:27.450> don't<00:03:27.570> know<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.500> hit
