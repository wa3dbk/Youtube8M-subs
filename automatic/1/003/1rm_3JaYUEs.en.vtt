create multi view applications our
application<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.320> contain<00:00:10.740> two<00:00:10.950> view

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
application is going to contain two view

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.940 
application is going to contain two view
controllers<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.990> when<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.139> press<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.679> button

same class file that we we've been

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.710 
same class file that we we've been
dealing<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> last<00:01:38.040> two<00:01:38.369> tutorials

dealing with in the last two tutorials

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
dealing with in the last two tutorials
and<00:01:39.720> we're<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> create<00:01:40.560> another<00:01:40.799> one

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and we're going to create another one

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
and we're going to create another one
and<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:43.530> same<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.659> we're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and the same is the first one and we're

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.740 
and the same is the first one and we're
going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> name<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.590> second<00:01:47.750> view

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to name this second view

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
going to name this second view
controller<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.799> finish<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.790> I'm<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
controller and finish and I'm going to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.039 
controller and finish and I'm going to
move<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> zip<00:01:56.430> files<00:01:56.700> into<00:01:56.939> resources<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
move the zip files into resources you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.780 
move the zip files into resources you
don't<00:01:58.079> need<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
don't need to do this I just want to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.179 
don't need to do this I just want to
group<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.780> classes<00:02:01.229> files<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> user

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
group the classes files and the user

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
group the classes files and the user
interface<00:02:02.759> files<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
interface files so now we're going to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
interface files so now we're going to
write<00:02:04.829> some<00:02:04.890> code<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.820> first<00:02:06.060> thing<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.479> want

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
write some code the first thing we want

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.570 
write some code the first thing we want
to<00:02:06.750> do

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
to do

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.270 
to do

new class this class is going to be the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.770 
new class this class is going to be the
first<00:02:25.430> view<00:02:25.700> controller<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:29.480> need<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
first view controller and we need to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.500 
first view controller and we need to
declare<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.400> first<00:02:31.670> vehicle<00:02:31.970> color<00:02:32.180> inside

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
declare the first vehicle color inside

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.890 
declare the first vehicle color inside
here<00:02:33.670> first<00:02:34.670> view<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:38.150> want<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.540> add<00:02:38.840> a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
here first view and we want to add a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.440 
here first view and we want to add a
property<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:40.430> shown<00:02:40.760> here<00:02:41.380> non-atomic<00:02:43.450> first

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
property as shown here non-atomic first

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:55.170

view<00:02:44.690> controller<00:02:44.890> first<00:02:49.300> first<00:02:51.280> view

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.270 

now<00:02:56.019> we<00:02:56.079> need<00:02:56.349> to<00:02:56.500> synthesize<00:02:56.769> it<00:02:57.150> inside<00:02:58.150> here

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
now we need to synthesize it inside here

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.740 
now we need to synthesize it inside here
first<00:03:00.280> view<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:02.680> need<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.980> add<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:04.180> H

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
first view and we need to add the H

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.460 
first view and we need to add the H
header<00:03:05.140> files<00:03:05.500> inside<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.189> end<00:03:06.370> file<00:03:07.470> first

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
header files inside the end file first

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.679 
header files inside the end file first
view<00:03:08.739> controller<00:03:08.799> dot<00:03:09.370> H<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:12.390> as<00:03:13.390> we<00:03:13.569> can

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
view controller dot H so now as we can

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.429 
view controller dot H so now as we can
see<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:15.090> two<00:03:16.090> functions<00:03:16.329> over<00:03:16.750> here<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
see we have two functions over here the

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.380 
see we have two functions over here the
application<00:03:18.129> did<00:03:18.280> finish<00:03:18.310> launching<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
application did finish launching and the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.460 
application did finish launching and the
dialog<00:03:21.090> we're<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.540> focus<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:23.109> this<00:03:23.260> one

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
dialog we're going to focus on this one

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.830 
dialog we're going to focus on this one
because<00:03:23.799> we<00:03:24.400> want<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.700> add<00:03:24.819> or<00:03:25.120> view<00:03:25.329> control

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
because we want to add or view control

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.110 
because we want to add or view control
when<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.200> application<00:03:26.950> runs<00:03:27.159> so<00:03:27.730> we<00:03:27.879> need<00:03:28.030> to

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
when the application runs so we need to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.309 
when the application runs so we need to
add<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.450> application<00:03:29.079> did<00:03:29.200> finish<00:03:29.260> launching

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
add the application did finish launching

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.520 
add the application did finish launching
function<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:34.540> what<00:03:34.900> we're<00:03:35.109> going<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.349> do

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
function so now what we're going to do

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.069 
function so now what we're going to do
this<00:03:35.709> firstly<00:03:36.609> controller<00:03:37.060> we're<00:03:37.780> going<00:03:37.959> to

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
this firstly controller we're going to

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.899 
this firstly controller we're going to
declare<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.500> new<00:03:38.680> class<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.159> we<00:03:39.400> want<00:03:39.819> to

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
declare a new class and we want to

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.039 
declare a new class and we want to
specify<00:03:41.970> I'm<00:03:42.970> going<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.269> explain<00:03:43.569> what<00:03:43.930> I'm

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
specify I'm going to explain what I'm

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.979 
specify I'm going to explain what I'm
doing

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
doing

00:03:45.989 --> 00:04:01.990 
doing
first<00:03:46.989> if<00:03:47.139> color<00:03:47.439> block<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.760> need<00:03:51.269> first

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.440 

so<00:04:02.630> first<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.830> equals<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.640> view<00:04:08.860> window<00:04:09.860> and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
so first you equals a view window and

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:19.710 
so first you equals a view window and
sub<00:04:11.450> view<00:04:13.150> first<00:04:14.150> view<00:04:14.860> view

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:29.780 

and<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.620> release

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.030 

so<00:04:30.790> what<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.150> did<00:04:31.300> just<00:04:31.450> here<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.470> first<00:04:32.740> thing

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
so what I did just here the first thing

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.530 
so what I did just here the first thing
I<00:04:33.940> declared<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:36.490> first<00:04:36.730> D<00:04:36.880> controller<00:04:37.240> class

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
I declared the first D controller class

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.040 
I declared the first D controller class
inside<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.110> new<00:04:38.260> variable<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.610> variable

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
inside the new variable and the variable

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.980 
inside the new variable and the variable
I<00:04:41.280> told<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.910> nib<00:04:43.120> file<00:04:43.390> of<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.720> first

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
I told that the nib file of the first

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.500 
I told that the nib file of the first
big<00:04:44.230> controller<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.940> first<00:04:45.940> d<00:04:46.120> controller

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
big controller is the first d controller

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.040 
big controller is the first d controller
note<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.410> didn't<00:04:47.920> and<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:49.180> zip<00:04:49.600> extension

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
note that I didn't and the zip extension

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.660 
note that I didn't and the zip extension
inside<00:04:51.040> this<00:04:51.310> name<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.050> then<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.770> told<00:04:54.340> that

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
inside this name and then I told that

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.940 
inside this name and then I told that
the<00:04:54.850> first<00:04:54.880> view<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.630> going<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.080> be<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:56.680> class

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
the first view is going to be the class

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.210 
the first view is going to be the class
I<00:04:57.160> declared<00:04:57.580> over<00:04:57.790> here<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.960> added<00:04:59.220> first

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
I declared over here and I added first

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.830 
I declared over here and I added first
the<00:05:00.730> view<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.300> first<00:05:01.540> view<00:05:01.810> controller

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
the view of the first view controller

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.160 
the view of the first view controller
class<00:05:02.710> inside<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.580> window<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.720> released

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
class inside the window and I released

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.800 
class inside the window and I released
the<00:05:05.980> first<00:05:06.310> day<00:05:06.700> a<00:05:06.970> view<00:05:07.300> which<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:07.660> declare

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
the first day a view which I declare

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.050 
the first day a view which I declare
over<00:05:08.110> here<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.590> unlocked<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.580> need<00:05:09.910> to

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
over here I unlocked it so I need to

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.380 
over here I unlocked it so I need to
release<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:11.140> then<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.790> released<00:05:12.790> what<00:05:13.360> I

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
release it and then I released what I

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.930 
release it and then I released what I
locked<00:05:14.170> inside<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.890> H<00:05:15.130> file<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:17.410> now<00:05:17.940> we're

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
locked inside the H file so now we're

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.990 
locked inside the H file so now we're
going<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.210> write<00:05:19.450> some<00:05:19.720> code<00:05:19.900> inside<00:05:20.140> the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
going to write some code inside the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.130 
going to write some code inside the
first<00:05:22.000> view<00:05:22.180> controller<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.810> second

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
first view controller and the second

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.900 
first view controller and the second
view<00:05:23.670> when<00:05:24.670> we<00:05:24.790> press<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.090> button<00:05:25.560> we<00:05:26.560> want<00:05:26.910> some

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
view when we press a button we want some

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.270 
view when we press a button we want some
action<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.510> occur<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.380> we're<00:05:29.710> going<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.010> add

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
action to occur so we're going to add

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:39.870 
action to occur so we're going to add

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
working just fine now what we're going

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.580 
working just fine now what we're going
to<00:06:46.130> do<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.669> write<00:06:47.120> a<00:06:47.150> new<00:06:47.480> function<00:06:47.510> inside<00:06:48.380> the

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
to do is write a new function inside the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.840 
to do is write a new function inside the
app<00:06:48.740> delegate<00:06:49.340> class<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:50.030> we'll<00:06:50.240> go<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.390> point

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
app delegate class and we'll go to point

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.909 
app delegate class and we'll go to point
the<00:06:52.850> actions<00:06:53.360> of<00:06:53.510> the<00:06:54.110> first<00:06:54.350> view<00:06:54.560> controller

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
the actions of the first view controller

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.530 
the actions of the first view controller
and<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:55.220> second<00:06:55.580> view<00:06:55.700> controller<00:06:55.760> to<00:06:56.419> the

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
and the second view controller to the

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.510 
and the second view controller to the
function<00:06:56.960> we<00:06:57.110> just<00:06:57.140> we're<00:06:57.890> going<00:06:58.040> to<00:06:58.160> declare

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
function we just we're going to declare

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.500 
function we just we're going to declare
inside<00:06:59.270> the<00:06:59.690> app<00:06:59.960> delegate<00:07:00.530> class<00:07:01.390> and<00:07:02.390> I'm

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
inside the app delegate class and I'm

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.200 
inside the app delegate class and I'm
going<00:07:02.690> to<00:07:02.750> show<00:07:02.930> you<00:07:02.990> how<00:07:03.230> to<00:07:03.290> create<00:07:03.710> new

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
going to show you how to create new

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:19.820 
going to show you how to create new
functions<00:07:05.210> inside<00:07:05.600> Xcode<00:07:08.230> switch<00:07:09.230> view

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:29.320 

do

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.000 

to

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.010 
to

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.610 
to
so<00:07:32.840> this<00:07:33.840> is<00:07:33.990> how<00:07:34.230> an<00:07:35.450> objective-c<00:07:36.620> function

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
so this is how an objective-c function

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.570 
so this is how an objective-c function
looks<00:07:37.800> like<00:07:38.040> in<00:07:38.400> the<00:07:38.550> first<00:07:40.100> the<00:07:41.100> first<00:07:41.310> thing

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 
looks like in the first the first thing

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.910 
looks like in the first the first thing
we<00:07:41.790> need<00:07:41.970> to<00:07:42.000> tell<00:07:42.330> Xcode<00:07:42.810> what<00:07:43.110> type<00:07:43.890> of

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:43.920 
we need to tell Xcode what type of

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.040 
we need to tell Xcode what type of

memory is going to need to unlock inside

memory is going to need to unlock inside

inside the return type well we need to

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.440 
inside the return type well we need to
specify<00:07:52.020> what<00:07:52.730> what<00:07:53.730> we're<00:07:53.880> going<00:07:54.060> to<00:07:54.180> return

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.450 
specify what what we're going to return

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.970 
specify what what we're going to return
inside<00:07:54.750> the<00:07:54.900> function<00:07:55.320> if<00:07:55.500> we're<00:07:55.710> going<00:07:55.860> to
