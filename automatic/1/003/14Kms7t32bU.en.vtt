00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.330
 semiconductor field effect transistor 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.000
 appliances 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 in which the current changes in 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.780
 the result of perpendicular action 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.110
 sense the electric field being created 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 input signals main advantage 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.539
 field effect transistors high input 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.230
 resistance in which can be 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.290
 same as electronic lamps and 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.070
 even more present and polar 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.840
 transistors more and more often 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.199
 will make room for the field 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.539
 principle children device 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.489
 elimination of the field effect transistor 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 the interior manager for the course as well 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.430
 its conditional and graphic 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.190
 the winner designation in the figure 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.790
 semiconductor plate 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 for example the type gene has on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.270
 opposite ends electrodes with 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.200
 the help of which it is included 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.059
 output controlled cycle 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 amplifier stage 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.610
 this one is powered by source e 2 and into it 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.740
 load enabled 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.900
 the French share passes the output current 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.150
 main carrier 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.750
 our example is electronic com 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 input control loop transistor 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.280
 formed by the third electrodes 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.409
 representing the area to others 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.060
 type of electrical conductivity 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 In this case, this area is a source 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.470
 power input circuit creates on 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.800
 the only capture goes this 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.000
 reverse voltage transistor 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.740
 voltage of the other polarity 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.020
 i.e. direct voltage across the CPM 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.490
 the transition is not served so then the input 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.759
 resistance will be very small 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.409
 in one circuit is included the source of the strong 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.400
 hesitation 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640
 physical field transistor processes 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.010
 happens as follows when changing 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.850
 input voltage changes reverse 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.440
 voltage on the ohm transition and from this 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.420
 changing clouds over the locking 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.010
 depleted layer according to the scheme it is shown that 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.970
 fridge 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.299
 accordingly 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.780
 changing will get cross section 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 areas 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.610
 through which the stream passes 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.390
 main charge carriers i.e. 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.650
 output current is an image called 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.030
 channel of petrov from which to the channel 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.870
 ethics are the main charge carriers 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.030
 call origins 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.440
 from the carrier channel passes to the electrode 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.149
 which is called drains 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.329
 control electrode designed to 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.129
 regulating the mail cross section 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.060
 channel 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.380
 called shutter 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.770
 if you increase the gate voltage it 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.849
 come in 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.159
 then the barrier point transition layer 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.180
 becomes thicker and the kidney is transverse 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.849
 channel cross-section decreases 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.449
 hence his resistance 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.109
 direct current zero PR increases 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.269
 the total becomes less with 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.970
 some closing voltage 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.400
 easier channel cross section will become 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.219
 equal to zero 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.119
 the result and the advice will be quite small 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.489
 the toilets are locked and with alas shutter the source 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.669
 equal zero over channels and more 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.030
 resistance to zero others less 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.950
 for example several hundred gender 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.109
 and the one who gets the chain more 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.109
 in order to input voltage 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.919
 perhaps more effectively managed 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:54.910
 output current 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.190
 main semiconductor materials in 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.350
 which channel is created must be high 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.980
 vsto if high concentration 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.640
 impurities 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.379
 then the barrier layer in it 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.629
 It turns out a large thickness in addition 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.180
 initial channel thickness 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.160
 at course from thief source equal zero 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.749
 should be small enough 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.549
 usually it does not exceed several 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.469
 micrometers 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.969
 blocking voltage at these 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.389
 conditions is units ford
