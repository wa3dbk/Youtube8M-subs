00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.860
 today we are going to see the unboxing of the new 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.930
 wireless charger for nexus 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.420
 the price is about 40 euros 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.280
 approximately and you can get it in 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.110
 the google play store but you have to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.360
 surely add about ten euros of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.190
 shipping costs because that's what 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.520
 They charge normally when you buy a 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.520
 nexus 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 as you can see it comes in a small 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 normal blue box and current 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.060
 to open it we cut the two pieces of 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.040
 adhesive tape that brings down 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.150
 and as you can see in the video it opens 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.030
 exactly as if it were a 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.830
 phone or any smartphone whatever 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.110
 first thing that we see when opening the box is the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.150
 wireless charger which we can 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.860
 Take out thanks to this plastic band 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.590
 next time we will move it away and we will see 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.270
 what else comes in the box the following 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.310
 what we see are the typical booklets 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.140
 which we do not usually do or 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.040
 damn case since to use this 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.040
 you do not have to be an engineer 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.040
 the next thing we're going to see is going to be the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.830
 wall charger as you can 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.570
 check in the video comes dismantled 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 in several pieces here we have the one that goes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 connected to the wall is the model 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.270
 European 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.950
 here we have the biggest part of 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.950
 charger that we will now assemble the other 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.720
 and finally the usb micro usb cable 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.190
 and that's because the box is already empty 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.420
 after removing the 40,000 plastics 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 in which the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.830
 accessories we will proceed to assemble them 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.780
 this is not an ikea piece of furniture so 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.540
 quiet, you just have to take the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.830
 usb part of the cable and connect it as 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.370
 you see in the video 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.370
 ah 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 now we take the other piece we return 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 to remove all the plastics and only 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.040
 it would be placed in the only hole 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.040
 possible left in the charger 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 after fitting the last piece already 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.489
 we would have the charger ready to be 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.489
 used 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 now let's take a look at the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.010
 another part of the charger as you can see 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.630
 It also comes covered with 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.630
 plastics that we are going to remove 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.770
 the measures of this gadget are 60 x 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.220
 60 x 12 5 millimeters and the weight is 105 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.500
 grams is pesadito 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.590
 this plastic here we are going to leave 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.860
 to remove it then connect the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 micro usb part of the cable and connect 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.550
 the charger to the current 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.130
 we take our nexus and we put it 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.230
 above, the first thing you will notice is that 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.450
 it is magnetized and it is a magnet 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.880
 powerful so it's easy that when 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.160
 you take the nexus, you also take the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.750
 loader stuck that's why we had not 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.150
 removed the back sticker so that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.180
 See what happened if we removed him 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 this protective sticker will remain the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.310
 bottom part with a texture a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.320
 little sticky it's like it's a 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.270
 sticker that sticks on the furniture where 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.700
 we set to have the charger 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.190
 we squeeze a little and then when 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.069
 we put our nexus and we remove it already 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.870
 we take the base with us 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.389
 now we are going to remove the bumper from 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.950
 nexus and let's try if it works with 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.470
 a ring type case that merges 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.379
 we put the cover and put the nexus 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.810
 on top of the charger as you can see it comes out 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.760
 a message of loading the magnet follows 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.190
 running and at the same time it's still 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.110
 loading our device 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.370
 you have to place the nexus more or less in 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.780
 the central part since if we put it 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.580
 very high or very low will not charge 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.630
 the ideal height is where you have the 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.760
 nexus lyrics 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.230
 It may seem a bit cumbersome but 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.120
 the trick is immediately 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.190
 if you liked the video, give it a like 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.909
 subscribe and share a greeting and we 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.909
 we see in the next 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.230
 the rifle
