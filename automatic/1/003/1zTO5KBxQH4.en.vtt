unusual ways to display them and hanging
them<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> ways<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.359> there's<00:00:21.660> many

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
them is one of the ways so there's many

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
them is one of the ways so there's many
ways<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.470> could<00:00:22.650> try<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.640> we're

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
ways we could try to do this first we're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
ways we could try to do this first we're
all<00:00:23.970> we're<00:00:24.210> taking<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> tillandsia<00:00:24.960> which<00:00:25.680> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
all we're taking the tillandsia which is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
all we're taking the tillandsia which is
just<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.460> an<00:00:26.699> air<00:00:26.849> plant<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> just

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
just like this an air plant is just

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.890 
just like this an air plant is just
gross<00:00:28.199> without<00:00:28.710> soil<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
gross without soil so the one the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.850 
gross without soil so the one the
easiest<00:00:31.320> method<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.969> garden<00:00:33.300> twine

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
easiest method is with this garden twine

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.709 
easiest method is with this garden twine
which<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.100> tends<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.270> invisible

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
which is tends to be very invisible

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.959 
which is tends to be very invisible
there's<00:00:37.590> no<00:00:37.770> longer<00:00:38.040> right<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> it's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
there's no longer right on this it's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.709 
there's no longer right on this it's
just<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.300> matter<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> getting<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:41.360> stay<00:00:42.360> put

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
just a matter of getting it to stay put

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
just a matter of getting it to stay put
and<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> look<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and how you want it to look this is the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
and how you want it to look this is the
very<00:00:45.450> ingenious<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.710> ingenious<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.340> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
very ingenious I'm not ingenious way but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
very ingenious I'm not ingenious way but
a<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.270> showing<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.379> also<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a way of showing it you can also do it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.270 
a way of showing it you can also do it
where<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> hangs<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.719> by<00:00:52.320> making<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
where it hangs this way by making the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080 
where it hangs this way by making the
wire<00:00:53.489> go<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:56.430> now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
wire go on this time some this way now

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
wire go on this time some this way now
this<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.840> done<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.829> series<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> ways

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this can be done in a series of ways

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.490 
this can be done in a series of ways
this<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.420> done<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.260> just

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this can be done this one was just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
this can be done this one was just
soaked<00:01:01.739> last<00:01:02.010> night<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> looks<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> little

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
soaked last night so it looks a little

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.390 
soaked last night so it looks a little
droopy<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> idea<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.949> take<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
droopy but the idea is to take this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
droopy but the idea is to take this
sheet<00:01:05.760> Moss<00:01:07.549> wrapping<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.030> whatever<00:01:09.540> roots

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
sheet Moss wrapping the whatever roots

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950 
sheet Moss wrapping the whatever roots
that<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> roots<00:01:11.460> themselves<00:01:12.240> just

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that are there the roots themselves just

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.920 
that are there the roots themselves just
wrapping<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.799> more<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.130> visual<00:01:14.369> aid

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
wrapping it it's more of a visual aid

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
wrapping it it's more of a visual aid
then<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> ability<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:19.340> wrap<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
then you have the ability to wrap that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
then you have the ability to wrap that
around<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.600> finished<00:01:24.960> product

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
around and you have the finished product

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.399 
around and you have the finished product
I<00:01:25.700> always<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.630> sea<00:01:28.140> like

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
I always think they look very sea like

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.069 
I always think they look very sea like
sea<00:01:28.979> creatures<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.329> another<00:01:30.630> way<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.049> showing

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
sea creatures so another way of showing

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.520 
sea creatures so another way of showing
them<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:32.310> taking<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.820> log<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.720> stick<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
them is by taking a log or a stick of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
them is by taking a log or a stick of
interest<00:01:34.979> driftwood<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.579> anything<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
interest driftwood or anything like this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
interest driftwood or anything like this
hanging<00:01:37.439> him<00:01:37.590> from<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.729> stick<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:40.259> shells

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
hanging him from that stick with shells

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
hanging him from that stick with shells
if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.909> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.540> another<00:01:42.960> way<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
if you like which is another way of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
if you like which is another way of
showing<00:01:43.740> them<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.549> other<00:01:44.670> way<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.240> would

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
showing them the other way to do would

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.410 
showing them the other way to do would
be<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> actual<00:01:46.590> shell<00:01:47.750> again<00:01:49.040> and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
be to take the actual shell again and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.440 
be to take the actual shell again and
they're<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.630> flexible<00:01:52.729> by<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.000> putting<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
they're so flexible by just putting the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.620 
they're so flexible by just putting the
air<00:01:57.450> plant<00:01:57.810> right<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> shell<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.600> then

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.050 

like<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:05.010> so<00:02:06.010> that<00:02:06.190> when<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.520> hang<00:02:06.760> this

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
like that so that when you hang this

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.250 
like that so that when you hang this
it's<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.140> type<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.410> thing<00:02:09.840> another<00:02:10.840> way<00:02:11.080> of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
it's this type of thing another way of

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.340 
it's this type of thing another way of
showing<00:02:11.590> an<00:02:11.740> air<00:02:11.920> plant<00:02:12.660> would<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.080> these

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
showing an air plant would be in these

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.710 
showing an air plant would be in these
glass<00:02:14.710> bulbs<00:02:15.250> by<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:15.970> having<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.510> air

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
glass bulbs by just having that air

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.880 
glass bulbs by just having that air
plant<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.180> bubble<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.540> shows<00:02:20.200> really<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
plant in the bubble it shows really the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.770 
plant in the bubble it shows really the
structure<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.580> what's<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.540> shows

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
structure of what's going on it shows

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.680 
structure of what's going on it shows
the<00:02:23.050> beauty<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.710> form<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.510> great

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the beauty of the form and it's a great

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.020 
the beauty of the form and it's a great
way<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.080> hanging<00:02:26.500> these<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.070> window<00:02:27.430> there's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
way of hanging these in a window there's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.830 
way of hanging these in a window there's
all<00:02:28.360> sorts<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.020> air<00:02:30.090> glass<00:02:31.090> containers<00:02:31.690> that

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
all sorts of air glass containers that

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.990 
all sorts of air glass containers that
can<00:02:32.020> work<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.410> well<00:02:32.620> another<00:02:33.400> way<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.790> saying

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
can work as well another way of saying

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.850 
can work as well another way of saying
is<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.600> do<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.050> take<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.290> piece<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.590> driftwood

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
is that do you take a piece of driftwood

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.880 
is that do you take a piece of driftwood
or<00:02:36.160> some<00:02:36.550> interesting<00:02:37.420> piece<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.660> log<00:02:38.050> there

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
or some interesting piece of log there

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.640 
or some interesting piece of log there
is<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.070> glue<00:02:39.459> these<00:02:39.880> air<00:02:40.630> plants<00:02:40.990> can<00:02:41.140> take<00:02:41.170> glue

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
is a glue these air plants can take glue

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.290 
is a glue these air plants can take glue
which<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.160> really<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.490> great<00:02:42.820> thing<00:02:43.120> because

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
which is a really a great thing because

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.630 
which is a really a great thing because
you<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.230> use<00:02:44.530> very<00:02:44.800> little<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.340> it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
you really just use very little of it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.610 
you really just use very little of it
this<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> waterproof<00:02:46.420> glue<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.440> use

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
this is a waterproof glue that we use

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.000 
this is a waterproof glue that we use
here<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> store<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:48.430> called<00:02:48.670> goo<00:02:48.970> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
here at the store it's called goo and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.320 
here at the store it's called goo and
basically<00:02:51.010> any<00:02:51.250> glue<00:02:51.640> that's<00:02:51.850> waterproof

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
basically any glue that's waterproof

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.930 
basically any glue that's waterproof
would<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.050> key<00:02:53.260> here<00:02:53.650> what<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.610> would<00:02:54.700> do

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
would be the key here what you would do

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.040 
would be the key here what you would do
is<00:02:55.239> just<00:02:55.270> take<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.040> put<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.100> little<00:02:57.280> dab<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
is just take it put a little dab on the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
is just take it put a little dab on the
air<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.709> log<00:03:01.260> tape<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.680> know<00:03:02.830> hold

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
air on the log tape that you know hold

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.160 
air on the log tape that you know hold
that<00:03:03.250> right<00:03:03.489> there<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.060> then<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:04.959> not

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
that right there and then you have not

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.470 
that right there and then you have not
only<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.500> sculptural<00:03:06.220> thing<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.269> hang

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
only a sculptural thing you can hang

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.050 
only a sculptural thing you can hang
this<00:03:07.660> log<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.170> any<00:03:08.320> way<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.620> want<00:03:09.070> you're<00:03:09.790> able

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
this log in any way you want you're able

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
this log in any way you want you're able
to<00:03:10.090> put<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.390> whole<00:03:10.570> thing<00:03:10.870> into<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.680> water

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
to put the whole thing into the water

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.790 
to put the whole thing into the water
and<00:03:12.220> take<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.850> out<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.120> let<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.269> dry<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:14.560> in

short what we have as many ways to do a
tillandsia<00:03:17.620> hanging<00:03:18.549> we<00:03:19.390> had<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.750> wire

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
tillandsia hanging we had the wire

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.920 
tillandsia hanging we had the wire
method<00:03:20.860> we<00:03:21.400> have<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.580> string<00:03:21.970> method<00:03:22.390> we<00:03:22.720> have

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
method we have a string method we have

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.900 
method we have a string method we have
the<00:03:23.110> glue<00:03:23.320> onto<00:03:23.530> something<00:03:24.070> else<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.580> hanging

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
the glue onto something else and hanging

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.360 
the glue onto something else and hanging
that<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.989> globe<00:03:26.290> method<00:03:26.860> like<00:03:27.010> so

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
that we have the globe method like so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.030 
that we have the globe method like so
and<00:03:27.670> we<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:28.900> purely<00:03:29.410> wrapping<00:03:29.860> and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
and we have just purely wrapping and

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.090 
and we have just purely wrapping and
moth-like<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.860> which<00:03:32.860> creates<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:34.450> hanging

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
moth-like so which creates this hanging

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.600 
moth-like so which creates this hanging
thing<00:03:36.100> like<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.519> thanks<00:03:37.150> for<00:03:37.180> watching
