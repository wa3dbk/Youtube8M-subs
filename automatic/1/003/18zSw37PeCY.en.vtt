on<00:02:14.420> set<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.580> yeah<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:19.330> 10<00:02:20.330> your<00:02:20.480> fingers

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
on set so yeah we know 10 your fingers

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.479 
on set so yeah we know 10 your fingers
10<00:02:21.050> toes<00:02:22.239> cause<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.950> don't<00:02:25.040> know<00:02:25.220> what<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
10 toes cause I don't know what the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.970 
10 toes cause I don't know what the
child<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.030> be<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.959> imagine<00:02:27.650> that's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
child is going to be so I imagine that's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.170 
child is going to be so I imagine that's
probably<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.610> at<00:02:28.760> front<00:02:29.030> door

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
probably not going to be at front door

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.059 
probably not going to be at front door
while<00:02:29.390> off<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:31.540> time<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.870> were<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.410> slow<00:02:33.709> I

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
while off as time this were like slow I

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.680 
while off as time this were like slow I
think<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> baby's<00:02:34.880> going<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.239> long<00:02:35.390> time

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
think the baby's going to be a long time

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.930 
think the baby's going to be a long time
we're<00:02:35.900> slowly<00:02:36.530> getting<00:02:36.800> bigger<00:02:37.190> how<00:02:37.760> does

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
we're slowly getting bigger how does

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.780 
we're slowly getting bigger how does
your<00:02:38.150> relationship<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:39.170> class<00:02:39.590> change<00:02:40.100> now

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
think that's really just as soon as i

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.140 
think that's really just as soon as i
said<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.989> panel<00:02:48.350> class<00:02:48.830> completely<00:02:49.670> they

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
said the panel class completely they

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.490

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
have always had a chemistry and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.830 
have always had a chemistry and
attraction<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.310> wasn't<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:53.000> wasn't<00:02:53.239> for

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
attraction but it wasn't it wasn't for

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.790 
attraction but it wasn't it wasn't for
Mantid<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.890> was<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.870> now<00:02:57.050> I<00:02:57.080> think<00:02:57.620> we

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
Mantid it was you know so now I think we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.440 
Mantid it was you know so now I think we
are<00:02:57.950> Klaus<00:02:58.280> probably<00:02:58.640> resents<00:02:59.060> Haley<00:02:59.420> a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
are Klaus probably resents Haley a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.030 
are Klaus probably resents Haley a
little<00:02:59.540> bit<00:02:59.959> because<00:03:02.560> he's<00:03:03.560> been<00:03:03.739> for<00:03:03.950> this

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040

Hayley see no and she's experienced a
lot<00:06:00.759> and<00:06:00.939> I<00:06:01.029> think<00:06:01.059> a<00:06:01.419> lot<00:06:01.449> of<00:06:01.689> those<00:06:01.929> students

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
lot and I think a lot of those students

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.019 
lot and I think a lot of those students
have<00:06:02.439> driven<00:06:02.619> her<00:06:02.949> to<00:06:03.219> make<00:06:03.459> some<00:06:03.610> decisions

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
have driven her to make some decisions

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.419 
have driven her to make some decisions
that<00:06:04.209> she<00:06:04.360> has<00:06:04.539> recently<00:06:05.110> and<00:06:05.409> I<00:06:05.439> think<00:06:05.679> when

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:06.429 
that she has recently and I think when

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:08.819 
that she has recently and I think when
the<00:06:06.519> fence<00:06:06.759> say<00:06:07.479> more<00:06:07.869> about<00:06:07.989> the<00:06:08.289> past<00:06:08.529> I

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:08.829 
the fence say more about the past I

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:11.429 
the fence say more about the past I
think<00:06:09.069> maybe<00:06:09.219> they'll<00:06:09.519> understand<00:06:10.349> to<00:06:11.349> the

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
think maybe they'll understand to the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.090 
think maybe they'll understand to the
polls<00:06:11.739> that<00:06:11.889> she's<00:06:12.099> done<00:06:12.309> recently
