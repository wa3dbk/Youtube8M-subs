game<00:02:04.789> for<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.420> system<00:02:05.719> from<00:02:05.840> Japan<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.469> that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
game for the system from Japan and that

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.730 
game for the system from Japan and that
is<00:02:07.279> the<00:02:07.369> actual<00:02:07.490> system<00:02:07.909> itself<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.560> say

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
is the actual system itself as I say

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.260 
is the actual system itself as I say
came<00:02:09.920> out<00:02:10.069> at<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.729> very<00:02:10.789> end<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> late

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
came out at the very end of the late

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.790 
came out at the very end of the late
nineties<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.750> particular<00:02:12.050> edition<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.680> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
nineties this particular edition of it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.670 
nineties this particular edition of it
came<00:02:12.950> out<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.280> 2000<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.840> boasts<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
came out in 2000 and it boasts a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.910 
came out in 2000 and it boasts a
superior<00:02:16.430> LCD<00:02:16.910> display<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:18.319> its<00:02:18.470> predecessor

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
superior LCD display to its predecessor

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.620 
superior LCD display to its predecessor
and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.110 
and
so<00:02:22.190> yeah<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:24.240> only<00:02:24.780> downside<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.590> thing

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
so yeah the only downside of this thing

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.110 
so yeah the only downside of this thing
that<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.600> know<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.820> put<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.970> outside

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that I that I know of is put it outside

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.300 
that I that I know of is put it outside
actually<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.290> primary<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
actually the primary one is that the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.920 
actually the primary one is that the
library<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> games<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.210> primarily

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
library of games for is primarily

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.430 
library of games for is primarily
Japanese<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.390> lot<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.600> them<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.780> RPGs

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
Japanese and a lot of them are RPGs

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.350 
Japanese and a lot of them are RPGs
so<00:02:37.620> pretty<00:02:37.860> much<00:02:37.950> excludes<00:02:38.760> me<00:02:38.940> from<00:02:39.150> playing

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so pretty much excludes me from playing

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.390 
so pretty much excludes me from playing
a<00:02:39.480> lot<00:02:39.630> less<00:02:39.750> titles<00:02:40.170> which<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> shame

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
a lot less titles which is a shame

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 
a lot less titles which is a shame
obviously<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> other<00:02:43.140> problem<00:02:43.380> with<00:02:43.440> it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
obviously and the other problem with it

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.350 
obviously and the other problem with it
is<00:02:43.710> in<00:02:43.920> spite<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> fact<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.520> came<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:44.730> 2000

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
is in spite of the fact it came out 2000

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690 
is in spite of the fact it came out 2000
it<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.990> got<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> backlit<00:02:46.590> screen<00:02:46.950> which

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
it is not got a backlit screen which

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.980 
it is not got a backlit screen which
when<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.940> consider<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.630> know<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.840> Nomad

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
when you consider you know the Nomad

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.330 
when you consider you know the Nomad
came<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.590> mid<00:02:49.710> nineties<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.160> did

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
came out in the mid nineties and it did

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.310 
came out in the mid nineties and it did
the<00:02:51.030> turbo<00:02:51.240> graphics<00:02:51.510> came<00:02:51.810> out<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.020> before

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
the turbo graphics came out in before

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010 
the turbo graphics came out in before
that<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.770> did<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.000> crazy<00:02:54.210> but

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
that and it did it's kind of crazy but

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.400 
that and it did it's kind of crazy but
um<00:02:55.260> we'll<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.400> look<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.670> we'll<00:02:57.000> see

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
um we'll have a look and we'll see

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
um we'll have a look and we'll see
likely<00:02:58.410> why<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:59.090> so<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.210> going<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.360> do

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
likely why that is so I'm going to do

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.380 
likely why that is so I'm going to do
first<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.840> pop<00:03:01.080> out<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> game<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.120> see

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
first is pop out a game and you know see

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.610 
first is pop out a game and you know see
if<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.540> guys<00:03:03.690> figure<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.080> our<00:03:04.200> system<00:03:04.470> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
if you guys figure out our system is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.980 
if you guys figure out our system is
just<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> game<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.610> know<00:03:06.390> my<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
just from the game I know my like the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.480 
just from the game I know my like the
game<00:03:07.140> will<00:03:07.260> probably<00:03:07.320> say<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
game will probably say on it what the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.830 
game will probably say on it what the
console<00:03:08.820> is<00:03:08.940> which<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.210> know<00:03:09.450> publish<00:03:09.750> in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
console is which you know publish in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.310 
console is which you know publish in
anyway

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320

on about this page but it was Adams

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.040 
on about this page but it was Adams
video<00:03:40.920> where<00:03:41.640> he<00:03:41.700> said<00:03:41.910> basically<00:03:42.870> when<00:03:42.990> you

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
video where he said basically when you

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.280 
video where he said basically when you
turn<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.350> system<00:03:43.710> on<00:03:43.830> with<00:03:43.980> nothing<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.430> it

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
turn this system on with nothing in it

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.870 
turn this system on with nothing in it
it<00:03:46.290> doesn't<00:03:46.590> turn<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.550> you<00:03:47.610> don't<00:03:47.790> have

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
it doesn't turn on so you don't have

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.100 
it doesn't turn on so you don't have
broken<00:03:48.210> a<00:03:48.360> lot<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.720> know<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.960> obviously

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
broken a lot you know and I obviously

fully Japanese manual what's worth
noting<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.270> knew<00:04:50.389> this<00:04:50.510> already<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:51.080> that

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
noting and I knew this already is that

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.680 
noting and I knew this already is that
it<00:04:51.410> doesn't<00:04:51.590> come<00:04:51.800> with<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:52.010> mains<00:04:52.190> adapter<00:04:52.690> so

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
it doesn't come with a mains adapter so

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.110 
it doesn't come with a mains adapter so
that's<00:04:53.840> all<00:04:54.020> she<00:04:54.200> wrote<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:55.310> now<00:04:55.460> there<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.790> is

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
that's all she wrote and now there it is

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.670 
that's all she wrote and now there it is
there's<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.419> little<00:04:56.540> console<00:04:56.900> here<00:04:57.169> as<00:04:57.560> you

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
there's the little console here as you

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.040 
there's the little console here as you
can<00:04:57.800> see<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:58.010> really<00:04:58.100> is<00:04:58.250> quite<00:04:58.550> tiny<00:04:59.050> you

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
can see it really is quite tiny you

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.270 
can see it really is quite tiny you
basically<00:05:00.350> put<00:05:00.830> one<00:05:01.100> double<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.430> battery<00:05:01.820> there

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
basically put one double a battery there

basically put one double a battery there
and<00:05:04.280> that's<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.700> runs<00:05:04.820> off<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.060> double-a

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
and that's it it runs off a double-a

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.820 
and that's it it runs off a double-a
battery<00:05:05.630> there<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.840> an<00:05:05.930> extension<00:05:06.229> port<00:05:06.560> there

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
battery there is an extension port there

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.440 
battery there is an extension port there

it for left-handed gamers and
right-handed<00:06:28.330> gamers<00:06:28.690> but<00:06:28.900> if<00:06:29.409> there's<00:06:29.680> the

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
right-handed gamers but if there's the

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.020 
right-handed gamers but if there's the
case<00:06:29.919> i<00:06:30.099> don't<00:06:30.129> have<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.400> switch<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.729> just<00:06:30.819> play

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
case i don't have a switch to just play

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.629 
case i don't have a switch to just play
around<00:06:32.340> was<00:06:33.340> crushed<00:06:33.580> change<00:06:35.490> but<00:06:36.490> yeah

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
around was crushed change but yeah

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.890 
around was crushed change but yeah
another<00:06:36.879> feel<00:06:37.060> decision<00:06:37.360> t<00:06:37.419> well<00:06:37.569> this<00:06:37.720> is

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
another feel decision t well this is

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.529 
another feel decision t well this is
when<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.080> hit<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.259> volume<00:06:38.590> button

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
when you hit the volume button

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.969 
when you hit the volume button
especially<00:06:40.539> got<00:06:40.960> three<00:06:41.289> or<00:06:41.379> four<00:06:41.560> preset

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
especially got three or four preset

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.800 
especially got three or four preset
levels<00:06:42.310> so<00:06:43.030> it's<00:06:43.180> not<00:06:43.270> sort<00:06:43.419> of<00:06:43.509> analog

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
levels so it's not sort of analog

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.409 
levels so it's not sort of analog
control<00:06:44.169> which<00:06:44.349> is<00:06:44.469> really<00:06:44.650> strange<00:06:45.419> let's

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
control which is really strange let's

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:57.600 
control which is really strange let's
see<00:06:46.509> if<00:06:46.569> we<00:06:46.659> can't<00:06:46.870> get<00:06:47.349> some<00:06:47.560> over<00:06:47.740> this
