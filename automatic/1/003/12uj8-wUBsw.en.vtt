00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.720 

that's<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.899> good<00:00:04.080> question<00:00:04.500> so<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.009> vr6<00:00:05.430> video

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
that's a good question so the vr6 video

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.430 
that's a good question so the vr6 video
is<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.000> one<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.210> did<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.629> Jason<00:00:06.899> from

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
is the one I did with Jason from

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.049 
is the one I did with Jason from
engineering<00:00:07.799> explained<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.760> really

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
engineering explained and I really

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.549 
engineering explained and I really
didn't<00:00:09.300> plan<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.780> way<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.200> kind<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
didn't plan it this way it just kind of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.749 
didn't plan it this way it just kind of
worked<00:00:10.679> out<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.070> I'm<00:00:11.340> wearing<00:00:11.610> my

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
worked out that I'm wearing my

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.360 
worked out that I'm wearing my
engineering<00:00:12.150> explaining<00:00:12.570> shirt<00:00:12.719> today<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.740> put

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
engineering explaining shirt today I put

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.499 
engineering explaining shirt today I put
this<00:00:14.490> shirt<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.089> went<00:00:15.269> through<00:00:15.420> all

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
this shirt on and then went through all

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660 
this shirt on and then went through all
the<00:00:15.599> questions<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.890> awesome<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the questions so how awesome is that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.599 
the questions so how awesome is that
but<00:00:18.029> um<00:00:18.570> good<00:00:18.900> question<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.920> car's<00:00:20.160> 14

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
but um good question so your car's 14

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.010 
but um good question so your car's 14
years<00:00:20.789> old<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.480> about<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.720> hundred

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
years old it's got about a hundred

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.660 
years old it's got about a hundred
thousand<00:00:22.350> miles<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.800> well<00:00:23.369> there<00:00:23.519> isn't

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
thousand miles on it well there isn't

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.240 
thousand miles on it well there isn't
technically<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.390> service<00:00:25.230> interval<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.070> those

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
technically a service interval for those

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
technically a service interval for those
chains<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.330> guides<00:00:27.660> where<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> tensioner<00:00:28.800> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
chains the guides where the tensioner is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.859 
chains the guides where the tensioner is
where<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> bad<00:00:30.480> idea<00:00:30.689> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
where and it's really not a bad idea to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.870 
where and it's really not a bad idea to
throw<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> set<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.470> chains<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> now<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> say

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
throw a set of chains on it now I say

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
throw a set of chains on it now I say
throw<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> set<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> chains<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.440> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
throw a set of chains on it but it's not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
throw a set of chains on it but it's not
like<00:00:34.620> putting<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.399> serpentine<00:00:35.880> belt<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.270> or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
like putting a serpentine belt on or

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.690 
like putting a serpentine belt on or
even<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> timing<00:00:37.440> belt<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.370> engine<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
even a timing belt on in this engine you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
even a timing belt on in this engine you
actually<00:00:39.059> pull<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> transmission<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
actually pull the transmission out and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
actually pull the transmission out and
do<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> timing<00:00:41.160> chains<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.750> get

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
do the timing chains that way it can get

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.600 
do the timing chains that way it can get
pretty<00:00:43.230> expensive<00:00:43.530> especially<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.460> you're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
pretty expensive especially if you're

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.720 
pretty expensive especially if you're
paying<00:00:44.850> someone<00:00:45.210> else<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.160> in<00:00:47.160> addition

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
paying someone else to do it in addition

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.959 
paying someone else to do it in addition
to<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:49.020> addition<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.010> replacing<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.610> chains

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
to in addition to replacing the chains

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
to in addition to replacing the chains
you're<00:00:51.300> gonna<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.440> guides<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you're gonna do the guides the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
you're gonna do the guides the
tensioners<00:00:53.789> basically<00:00:54.539> everything<00:00:55.110> behind

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
tensioners basically everything behind

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
tensioners basically everything behind
there<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.770> well<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.370> reseal<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.000> covers<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
there as well as reseal the covers it's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
there as well as reseal the covers it's
also<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.649> good<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
also a really good time if you have a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
also a really good time if you have a
manual<00:01:00.000> transmission<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.690> dump<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.989> clutch<00:01:01.260> in

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
manual transmission to dump a clutch in

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979 
manual transmission to dump a clutch in
it<00:01:01.590> even<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.000> completely<00:01:03.270> worn<00:01:03.840> out

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it even if it's not completely worn out

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320 
it even if it's not completely worn out
at<00:01:04.320> 100<00:01:04.739> K<00:01:04.979> depending<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> cars<00:01:06.119> been

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
at 100 K depending on how the cars been

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
at 100 K depending on how the cars been
driven<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.110> could<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> last

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
driven you could be you know on the last

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.510 
driven you could be you know on the last
like<00:01:08.580> 25%<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.659> 30%<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> clutch<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
like 25% or 30% of the clutch if you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
like 25% or 30% of the clutch if you
still<00:01:11.760> plan<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.150> keeping<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.659> longer<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.260> would

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
still plan on keeping it longer I would

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
still plan on keeping it longer I would
go<00:01:13.710> ahead<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> drop<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> clutch<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> never<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
go ahead and drop a clutch in it never a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.030 
go ahead and drop a clutch in it never a
bad<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> especially<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.909> 100k

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
bad time to do that especially at 100k

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
bad time to do that especially at 100k
but<00:01:20.040> again<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.460> expensive<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.840> part

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
but again it's expensive you know part

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.690 
but again it's expensive you know part
of<00:01:22.380> me<00:01:22.439> says<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.159> making<00:01:23.430> any

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
of me says that that's not making any

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
of me says that that's not making any
noise<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> don't<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.780> any<00:01:24.960> issues<00:01:25.640> keep

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
noise and you don't have any issues keep

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.450 
noise and you don't have any issues keep
it<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.320> evaluate<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> but

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it going and and just evaluate it but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
it going and and just evaluate it but
this<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:29.939> also<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> type<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> failure

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this could also be the type of failure

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.730 
this could also be the type of failure
that<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:32.220> driving<00:01:32.460> along<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.060> day<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
that you're driving along one day and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
that you're driving along one day and
something<00:01:34.740> breaks<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.240> valves

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
something breaks and now we have valves

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.410 
something breaks and now we have valves
and<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.470> internal<00:01:37.920> engine<00:01:38.220> damaged<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.880> I'd

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and an internal engine damaged so I'd

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.840 
and an internal engine damaged so I'd
like<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:39.990> chains<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
like to put chains on it I think at the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.020 
like to put chains on it I think at the
mileage<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.329> age<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.710> again

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
mileage and age that it's at but again

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
mileage and age that it's at but again
it's<00:01:45.030> expensive<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.590> also<00:01:46.710> understand

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it's expensive so I can also understand

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
it's expensive so I can also understand
the<00:01:47.340> other<00:01:47.490> side<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.939> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.540> waiting<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the other side of kind of waiting but I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
the other side of kind of waiting but I
will<00:01:49.590> tell<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.310> replacing<00:01:50.909> those

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
will tell you that replacing those

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.030 
will tell you that replacing those
chains<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:52.020> hell<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.530> lot<00:01:52.680> cheaper<00:01:52.710> than

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
chains is a hell of a lot cheaper than

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340 
chains is a hell of a lot cheaper than
fixing<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> cylinder<00:01:54.509> head<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.930> having<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
fixing the cylinder head and having to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.170 
fixing the cylinder head and having to
do<00:01:55.439> internal<00:01:55.860> engine<00:01:56.130> repair<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:57.030> you're

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
do internal engine repair now you're

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.749 
do internal engine repair now you're
looking<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.659> head<00:01:57.930> gasket<00:01:58.530> machine<00:01:59.009> work<00:01:59.310> head

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
looking at head gasket machine work head

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.410 
looking at head gasket machine work head
bolt<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.290> whole<00:02:01.469> nine<00:02:01.740> yards<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
bolt you know the whole nine yards so I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
bolt you know the whole nine yards so I
would<00:02:03.810> lean<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.500> side<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> replacing

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
would lean more on the side of replacing

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.450 
would lean more on the side of replacing
them<00:02:05.490> than<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.820> replacing<00:02:06.360> them
