00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.400
 until now the gear change with 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.640
 double clutch was only reserved to 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.440
 the high-end cars from 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.540
 now the next acceleration of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.090
 transmission is with double clutch and is 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.480
 At your service we present the new 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.349
 tractor 6r de jon diat with the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.239
 revolutionary clive air transmission 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.029
 results in greater comfort 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.029
 acceleration and efficiency 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 outstanding 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.340
 dire straits is a technology of 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.329
 revolutionary transmission let's know your 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.850
 functioning 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.550
 in elektra broadcast one day 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.979
 It consists of a mechanical gearbox 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.890
 with two integrated clutches inside 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.289
 the housing the gearbox with 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.679
 Dual clutch technology has 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.679
 eight gears 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.540
 one of the clutches controls the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.180
 odd marches the other takes care of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.250
 the peer marches the force coming 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 of the motor passes through the connected clutch 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.000
 and it flows through one of the two 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.040
 sections of the gearbox and the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 group selected before being 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.450
 transferred to the differential 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.180
 each clutch takes care of one of the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.610
 Two sections of power step 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.800
 Odd gears and even gears 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 when a march is in pomegranate the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.340
 Next gear is ready to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.340
 dock in the opposite section 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.200
 with a march always aligned only 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.400
 they have to open and close to perform 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 the gear change 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.280
 the change is fast and smooth without 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.560
 power interruptions between the motor 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.030
 and the transmission providing greater 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.030
 comfort and efficiency 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 used in formula 1 only the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.799
 electromagnetic actuators ensure a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.549
 fast and efficient operation of 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.619
 marches of rounding six of the two 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.530
 clutches ensure a continuous flow of 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.069
 power the speed of change generates a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.709
 outstanding acceleration the change of 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.900
 serious air can be handled in mode 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.540
 automatic or manual its handling is 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.910
 simple and intuitive speeds 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.560
 work can be scheduled and it's true 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 is the brake has built-in function 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.310
 auto clutch 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.469
 ibc a groups are designed to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.379
 adapt perfectly to your work

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.109
 kilometers per hour at 1550 revolutions 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.170
 per minute and 50 kilometers per hour to 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:52.139
 only 1600 revolutions per minute the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.359
 ied direct transmission offers the maximum 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.489
 efficiency and how to reduce 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.219
 number of group changes means 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.290
 fewer introductions of torque the result 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:04.129
 it is a smoother operation and a 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.129
 greater fuel savings 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.730
