views<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> probably<00:00:57.449> expected<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> get

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
views and I probably expected to get

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.689 
views and I probably expected to get
loads<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> dislikes<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.609> really

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
loads of dislikes but I don't really

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.069 
loads of dislikes but I don't really
care<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> honest<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.930> what

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
care to honest because that's not what

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.349 
care to honest because that's not what
my<00:01:01.199> channels<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.520> wanted<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> upload

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
my channels about but I wanted to upload

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.690 
my channels about but I wanted to upload
it<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.379> had<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.010> my<00:01:05.339> PC

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it because you know I had it on my PC

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.140 
it because you know I had it on my PC
and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.450> thought<00:01:06.600> well<00:01:06.840> might<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.049> well<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> yeah

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and I thought well might as well so yeah

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.950 
and I thought well might as well so yeah
I<00:01:09.390> believe<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I believe that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.030 
I believe that
and<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.590> also<00:01:11.010> rendering<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> moment<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
and I'm also rendering at the moment a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.760 
and I'm also rendering at the moment a
oblivion<00:01:14.040> video<00:01:14.330> which<00:01:15.330> will<00:01:16.520> be<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:19.590> better

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
oblivion video which will be in better

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
oblivion video which will be in better
quality<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.640> 1080p<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> it's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
quality because it's in 1080p and it's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.580 
quality because it's in 1080p and it's
got<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.780> loads<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
got like loads of and it's going to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
got like loads of and it's going to
take<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.070> hours<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> render<00:01:23.670> which

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
take a like a two hours to render which

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
take a like a two hours to render which
is<00:01:24.630> ridiculous<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
hopefully I'll just find it ah it's not

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.540 
hopefully I'll just find it ah it's not
there<00:05:17.939> because<00:05:18.180> I<00:05:18.810> am<00:05:19.439> in<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.919> window<00:05:20.219> already

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
there because I am in the window already

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.519 
there because I am in the window already
so<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.360> won't<00:05:21.539> load<00:05:21.719> it<00:05:21.900> just<00:05:22.110> yet<00:05:22.289> I'll<00:05:22.379> have

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
so it won't load it just yet I'll have

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.189 
so it won't load it just yet I'll have
to<00:05:22.680> reopen<00:05:23.339> this<00:05:23.639> weapon<00:05:23.969> a<00:05:24.029> minute<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:24.449> you

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
to reopen this weapon a minute but you

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.969 
can even click on ignores normal weapon
resistance<00:05:28.050> basically<00:05:28.439> makes<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:28.889> it

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
resistance basically makes it so it

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.659 
resistance basically makes it so it
doesn't<00:05:29.159> break<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.729> guess<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:31.460> no<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.550> doesn't

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
doesn't break I guess and no it doesn't

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.249 
doesn't break I guess and no it doesn't
know<00:05:32.789> a<00:05:32.849> liar<00:05:33.029> basically<00:05:33.750> when<00:05:33.900> someone<00:05:34.080> has

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
know a liar basically when someone has

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.200 
know a liar basically when someone has
weapon<00:05:34.560> resistance<00:05:34.979> as<00:05:35.219> a<00:05:35.279> spell<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:36.089> you

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
weapon resistance as a spell and you

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.469 
weapon resistance as a spell and you
attack<00:05:36.449> them<00:05:36.919> it<00:05:37.919> would<00:05:38.159> it'll<00:05:38.430> ignore<00:05:38.789> it<00:05:38.939> so

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
attack them it would it'll ignore it so

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.360 
attack them it would it'll ignore it so
that's<00:05:40.020> basically<00:05:40.259> how<00:05:40.409> it<00:05:40.439> works

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
that's basically how it works

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.480 
that's basically how it works
