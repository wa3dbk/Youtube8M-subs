00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.690
 So even now, most of our books, which are designated as national treasures and treasures, 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.580
 It was a compiled book before the Japanese invasion of Imjinwa 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.360
 It shows that many books were damaged during the Japanese invasion 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 there is 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.880
 The problem that we had to solve in the full 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.990
 You have to pay attention 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.829
 And now when the Gwanghae 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.809
 It is now time to publish this book to correct things like Confucian institutions 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 This book title is interesting 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:46.559
 A book that recorded the history of the Joseon Dynasty of Confucianism 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:53.160
 There was a book called What Happened. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:57.780
 Then again, now worth a book of deeds is also supplemented upgrade one book per 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 Discussion section of the book also works compatriot quickly samgan 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:08.970
 It called station will usually called a record past practices of Korea 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.090
 By compiling it only after the war that his yihaejin 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.189
 Something like a period to fix things like this 5 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:23.130
 In particular , in the book, "Northeast Expedition Realism," records of Admiral Yi Sun- 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:30.030
 So, by emphasizing the country and the achievements of these Chinese people, 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.860
 A book containing such an effort to make it a personal and continue to be personalized, 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.340
 Counseling room 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 Then, while 2 King Gwanghae the compilation of the book DONGKUK quickly corresponding line quality also 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 Record all the compilations 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.259
 Dongkuk Rapid 3-rd conduct We can make dog of cold house again We probably 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 I know a lot of opposition from you in France last year. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:03.270
 Inde books organize pictures with the main ceremonies of the Joseon royal family and those recorded Dongguk 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.210
 It is the limit of the record of the church of the process which compiled the stone which corresponds quickly . 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.850
 review 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:14.709
 In particular, Gwanghaegun has paid much attention to the production 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.490
 In particular, it seems that the situation produced a chemistry book leak 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.220
 Now, the Joseon Dynasty was organized perspective that the production of chemical weapons as a book 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:26.530
 To the screen by tying prayer 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:32.290
 The process of making various Hadid processes is described in the book of chemistry . 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:36.970
 I have compiled and prayed, so this is now quite a cultural business or compilation 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.910
 It was no jinhae who showed prominent performance in business . 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.140
 This is something that was not quite so well known until now . 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.140
 U 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.709
 Another word that comes to mind when you are in Abbaon is the Silly Eternity neutral diplomacy 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.150
 Part of it. 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.470
 On the background of the times when Gwanghaegun was able to carry out foreign policy 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.819
 I'll see. 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:11.000
 In the same era when the Gwanghae army was crowned in 1608 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:18.049
 In the aftermath of the Japanese invasion of Imjin, I helped the Korean people . 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.549
 A country built by the Ruzhen, who leaned over the gap and grew up in the northeast area 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.810
 I'm curious. 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:30.200
 We also had an old pick era Ruzhens country had established its consideration of the above 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:35.480
 Sorry, had followed the gold country to establish who is frowning quite the dream is a country 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:41.870
 I was nurturing the power mainly in the East North East. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.950
 And this ultimate goal is to invade the Ming Dynasty and take control of the antigenic continent. 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.030
 Will 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.290
 But I always say this obstacle close Shipbuilding Shipbuilding Thanks Movie 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:58.069
 So if you are going to invade some countries 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.380
 Iong is quite free and entered the shipbuilding invaded in the process, so the first shipbuilding 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.359
 By pressing the adjustment 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:11.090
 If not knitted or enter into diplomatic relations broke down it was possible this invasion 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:12.950
 This is a historical evidence that continues to be a proof . 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:19.459
 If we are like Kim 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.449
 Aftershocks There is no way to stop the process of hitting the Song Dynasty 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.280
 Surveying 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.320
 At the time it appeared that the people like Kim Bu-sik by building a large number eventually 4 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.260
 There was no war. 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.090
 And remember, who's the one who's up against it? 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.820
 The request should be so repulsive that you should know that such historical experiences 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.960
 The fact is it keeps repeating. 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:46.849
 So the reason we now have an important history surrounding our peninsula Name 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:52.580
 What about China and Russia about each country? 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:57.849
 This historical experience when more to worry and always keep in mind La shape 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:03.330
 Repeating a similar thing has been a black day. 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:06.819
 In any case, the Nutchez is now expanding its forces to hit the Ming Dynasty 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:12.280
 As a skirmish, I press this ship. 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:17.469
 Constantly pressurizing the composition and invading the two bottles again, and now do not rest it 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.460
 In this situation, the Ming Dynasty continued to press the Ming Dynasty border area, 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:23.229
 In the country 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:28.120
 We request the dispatch to the Composition person and request the dispatch of Gwangyang Bulgogi directly. 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:32.949
 Su Ming because we tell you to help me take over the shipbuilding ye now we 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:37.060
 I wonder if it would be natural for you to help me when I'm in a crisis like this. 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:41.650
 I request a dispatch to the composition. 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:44.199
 We are still in trouble with shipbuilding. We are now. Afghanistan 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:49.389
 It's about sending troops or sending troops to Iraq. 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:52.539
 In its modern history are those surrounding the Vietnamese troops Thomas soared that this debate 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:57.969
 This is very important, like a leader's decision. 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:06:03.520
 I'm in trouble with the Yellow Sea. 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:06.279
 Abundant evil 11 years ago Joe even betrayed the Ming Dynasty, 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.569
 I can not dispatch . 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:17.020
 I was trying to help you , so Gwanghaegun knew the international situation very well. 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:19.599
 A candidate or easy powerhouse Ming after nation, visited North Korea off that tilt 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:26.020
 Just know that the wrong stimulus 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:30.639
 It is clear that Chosun certainly does not have the right to abstain from any part of the war. 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:35.349
 So many of them, of course, oppose it. 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:40.210
 It is not forbidden to establish diplomatic relations with him afterward, that is, Ming and mourning unconditionally 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:42.129
 Give me a side that few people have the troops flesh that position quite tuned 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:47.139
 I did not. 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:52.449
 In 1619, the Gwanghae Army decided to make the illness 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:54.129
 But in the process, his thugs who work for the fire which rivers okrim 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.520
 And the vein 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:01.419
 As commander of the dispatcher , 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:07.089
 I invite you to come down for vinyl 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:09.069
 Then, the contents of which I found later in Japan looking for a hyangbae may be surrendered 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.720
 Yigetjiyo called Su 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:15.160
 so 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:20.980
 We do not want a war with the post-war music of our country. 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:25.330
 Although sleep around without being able to enter the Ming Dynasty because we're guys 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:32.050
 The purpose of establishing diplomatic relations and living well in the water 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:35.800
 So, after the gospel of gold, 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:40.990
 I do not have a war , I just do Pohang. 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:44.740
 This does not mean that the self-control of the Joseon Dynasty has greatly altered the meaning of the soul 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:49.750
 How do those unknowns have 1,000 won ? 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:52.050
 I can not go to the battlefield and die South, but if I surrender, 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.050
 Graduated
