00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
hundred percent natural so i use i was

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.170 
hundred percent natural so i use i was
making<00:02:14.709> my<00:02:14.829> own<00:02:14.860> chicken<00:02:15.310> stock<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:15.879> that<00:02:16.030> was

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
making my own chicken stock but that was

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.790 
making my own chicken stock but that was
getting<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.569> bit<00:02:16.719> tedious

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
getting a bit tedious

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.090 
getting a bit tedious
and<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.400> wasn't<00:02:19.110> working<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.680> mess<00:02:20.800> for

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
and it just wasn't working the mess for

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.900 
and it just wasn't working the mess for
us<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.970> um<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.990> chose<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:24.010> brand<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:24.730> that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
us so um I chose that brand because that

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.180 
us so um I chose that brand because that
was<00:02:25.270> has<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.110> best<00:02:26.260> ingredients<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.890> doesn't

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
was has the best ingredients it doesn't

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.620 
was has the best ingredients it doesn't
have<00:02:27.310> any<00:02:27.490> sugar<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.970> has<00:02:28.210> very<00:02:28.480> little

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
have any sugar in it has very little

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.980 
have any sugar in it has very little
salt<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.650> salt<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.460> added<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.420> sea

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
salt the salt that is added to it is sea

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.500 
salt the salt that is added to it is sea
salt<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.250> that's<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.240> one<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.450> I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
salt and so that's just the one that I

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.740 
salt and so that's just the one that I
felt<00:02:34.720> was<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.870> best<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.550> will<00:02:37.150> cook<00:02:37.480> her

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
felt was the best so I will cook her

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.210 
felt was the best so I will cook her

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
really excited about that but most of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.690 
really excited about that but most of
the<00:03:53.590> time<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.920> chicken<00:03:54.220> then<00:03:54.370> we<00:03:54.459> have

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.590 
of the chicken and some other selected
meets<00:04:08.590> our<00:04:08.920> previously<00:04:09.459> frozen<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:10.540> you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
meets our previously frozen and so you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.840 
meets our previously frozen and so you
can't<00:04:10.930> refreeze<00:04:11.350> them<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.980> if<00:04:12.340> they<00:04:12.610> had<00:04:12.730> like

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
can't refreeze them so if they had like

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.000 
can't refreeze them so if they had like
a<00:04:12.940> super<00:04:13.360> great<00:04:13.510> deal<00:04:13.840> on<00:04:13.870> me<00:04:14.230> we<00:04:14.590> couldn't

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
a super great deal on me we couldn't

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.720 
a super great deal on me we couldn't
just<00:04:15.400> buy<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:17.650> know<00:04:17.769> stock<00:04:18.220> up<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.549> it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
just buy it and you know stock up on it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.409 
just buy it and you know stock up on it
and<00:04:18.790> refreeze<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:21.250> that's<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:22.090> little<00:04:22.180> bit

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
and refreeze it so that's a little bit

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.440 
and refreeze it so that's a little bit
frustrating

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.290 

so<00:04:26.450> we've<00:04:26.600> got<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.990> size<00:04:27.920> then<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.180> what

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
so we've got the size then this is what

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.830 
so we've got the size then this is what
would<00:04:29.510> they<00:04:29.630> had<00:04:29.840> out<00:04:30.200> for<00:04:30.980> mountain<00:04:31.220> town

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
would they had out for mountain town

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.480 
would they had out for mountain town
