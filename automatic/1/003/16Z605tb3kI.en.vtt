glitches<00:00:41.220> in<00:00:41.309> runescape<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.910> most<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.809> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
glitches in runescape as most of you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.330 
glitches in runescape as most of you
guys<00:00:42.960> probably<00:00:43.020> already<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.100> first

clip<00:00:44.580> there<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.970> trap<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.720> Lumbridge

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
clip there is a trap in the Lumbridge

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680 
clip there is a trap in the Lumbridge
basement<00:00:46.470> dungeon<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.449> trap

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
basement dungeon and to get this trap

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
basement dungeon and to get this trap
you'll<00:00:48.930> first<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.199> a<00:00:49.290> light<00:00:49.440> source<00:00:49.470> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you'll first need a light source and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
you'll first need a light source and
basically<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> walk<00:00:50.970> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.330> trap<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
basically when you walk on the trap and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
basically when you walk on the trap and
open<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.320> an<00:00:52.470> interface<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.309> interface<00:00:53.340> will

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
open up an interface the interface will

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
open up an interface the interface will
prevent<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.269> from<00:00:54.300> falling<00:00:54.690> down<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.110> trap

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
prevent you from falling down this trap

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.530 
prevent you from falling down this trap
and<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:55.980> teleport<00:00:56.400> and<00:00:57.269> that<00:00:57.420> would

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
and you can now teleport and that would

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.240 
and you can now teleport and that would
mean<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:58.199> soon<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> teleport<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.129> did

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
mean that as soon as you teleport or did

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
mean that as soon as you teleport or did
fall<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> trap<00:00:59.970> in<00:01:00.420> another<00:01:00.780> location

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
fall to the trap in another location

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.649 
fall to the trap in another location
than<00:01:01.589> actually<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.400> lumbridge<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.089> swamp

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
than actually in the lumbridge a swamp

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.660 
than actually in the lumbridge a swamp
dungeon<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> could<00:01:05.190> be<00:01:05.220> combined<00:01:05.580> with

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
dungeon so this could be combined with

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
dungeon so this could be combined with
another<00:01:05.940> glitch<00:01:06.210> their<00:01:06.479> interface<00:01:06.960> walk<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
another glitch their interface walk and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.039 
another glitch their interface walk and
it<00:01:08.070> would<00:01:08.220> only<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.610> once<00:01:09.180> you've<00:01:09.360> exited<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it would only be once you've exited that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
it would only be once you've exited that
interface<00:01:10.620> that<00:01:10.860> you'd<00:01:10.979> fall<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.460> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
interface that you'd fall down this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
interface that you'd fall down this
track<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.840> sure<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> guys<00:01:13.320> would<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
track so I'm sure you guys would like to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
track so I'm sure you guys would like to
know<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.370> can<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
know what you can actually do with this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
know what you can actually do with this
glitch<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.320> use<00:01:16.440> it<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> actually

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
glitch so you could use it to actually

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.090 
glitch so you could use it to actually
remove<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.180> game<00:01:18.390> tiles<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> game<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
remove the game tiles from the game so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
remove the game tiles from the game so
Eric<00:01:20.400> Hauck<00:01:20.549> joy<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.030> decided<00:01:21.390> he<00:01:21.630> wanted<00:01:21.810> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
Eric Hauck joy here decided he wanted to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
Eric Hauck joy here decided he wanted to
just<00:01:22.110> casually<00:01:22.710> remove<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> Castle<00:01:23.640> Wars

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
just casually remove the Castle Wars

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.420 
just casually remove the Castle Wars
bridge<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> since<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.830> patched<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
bridge so since this is now patched I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.770 
bridge so since this is now patched I
can<00:01:26.549> show<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.760> guys<00:01:26.850> exactly<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.540> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
can show you guys exactly how this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.289 
can show you guys exactly how this
glitch<00:01:28.049> worked<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.820> having<00:01:29.820> walked<00:01:30.090> an

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
glitch worked and having walked an

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
glitch worked and having walked an
interface<00:01:30.780> onto<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> trap<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.890> had

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
interface onto the trap and I had

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.260 
interface onto the trap and I had
teleported<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> Castle<00:01:32.939> Wars

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
teleported to Castle Wars

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
teleported to Castle Wars
you'd<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:33.810> start<00:01:34.020> interface<00:01:34.409> walking

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you'd have to start interface walking

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
you'd have to start interface walking
and<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.430> easiest<00:01:35.729> part<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> doing<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.390> was

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and the easiest part of doing this was

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.389 
and the easiest part of doing this was
the<00:01:36.810> first<00:01:37.020> performance<00:01:37.409> toll<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
the first performance toll and that

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.370 
the first performance toll and that
stalls<00:01:38.670> were<00:01:38.840> explained<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> previous

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
stalls were explained in a previous

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.709 
stalls were explained in a previous
episode<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.799> epic<00:01:41.490> glitches<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.179> an<00:01:42.420> example

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
episode of epic glitches so an example

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.690 
episode of epic glitches so an example
of<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.109> patch<00:01:43.289> stall<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:44.100> whistle

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of a patch stall would be the whistle

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
of a patch stall would be the whistle
and<00:01:44.939> moat<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.990> recently<00:01:46.350> patched<00:01:46.590> on

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
and moat which was recently patched on

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.620 
and moat which was recently patched on
the<00:01:46.920> 25th<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.399> April<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.270> while<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.600> were

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the 25th of April so while you were

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.060 
the 25th of April so while you were
stalling<00:01:49.109> you<00:01:49.320> could<00:01:49.469> click<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:49.829> locked

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
stalling you could click your locked

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.649 
stalling you could click your locked
careers<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:50.880> stack<00:01:51.119> off<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> top

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
careers and they would stack off on top

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.810 
careers and they would stack off on top
of<00:01:51.780> each<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:52.109> and<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.159> eventually<00:01:53.670> got

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
of each other and this eventually got

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.130 
of each other and this eventually got
patched<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> could<00:01:54.509> only<00:01:54.600> stack<00:01:54.929> two

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
patched and you could only stack two

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
patched and you could only stack two
interfaces<00:01:55.499> on<00:01:55.890> top<00:01:56.039> of<00:01:56.130> each<00:01:56.249> other<00:01:56.429> which

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
interfaces on top of each other which

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639 
interfaces on top of each other which
you'll<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> Frog<00:01:57.899> single<00:01:58.259> clip<00:01:58.469> later

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you'll see in the Frog single clip later

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
you'll see in the Frog single clip later
so<00:01:59.609> while<00:01:59.729> these<00:01:59.880> interfaces<00:02:00.420> were<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> period

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
so while these interfaces were a period

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
so while these interfaces were a period
one<00:02:01.079> by<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.499> you<00:02:01.950> could<00:02:02.100> click<00:02:02.340> where<00:02:02.609> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
one by one you could click where you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.359 
one by one you could click where you
wanted<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> walk<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.200> interfaces<00:02:04.829> would

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
wanted to walk and the interfaces would

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
wanted to walk and the interfaces would
prevent<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.789> from<00:02:05.820> walking<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.170> you'd<00:02:07.320> have

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
prevent you from walking so you'd have

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
prevent you from walking so you'd have
to<00:02:07.469> use<00:02:07.710> items<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.520> able<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.759> activate<00:02:09.210> your

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
essentially walking around runescape as

essentially walking around runescape as
a<00:03:44.790> frog<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.360> you'd<00:03:46.260> have<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.500> make<00:03:46.590> sure<00:03:46.770> you

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
a frog and you'd have to make sure you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.350 
a frog and you'd have to make sure you
stay<00:03:47.190> interface<00:03:47.700> while<00:03:47.910> you're<00:03:48.060> doing<00:03:48.240> this

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
stay interface while you're doing this

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.630 
stay interface while you're doing this
or<00:03:48.540> you'd<00:03:48.660> lose<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.900> effect<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.370> really

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
or you'd lose the effect but a really

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.830 
or you'd lose the effect but a really
easy<00:03:50.790> method<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.240> doing<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.540> would<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:51.750> to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
easy method of doing this would be to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.170 
easy method of doing this would be to
click<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> lot<00:03:52.500> freer<00:03:52.890> everybody<00:03:53.700> folded<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
click a lot freer everybody folded the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.080 
click a lot freer everybody folded the
trap<00:03:54.420> up<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.810> when<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.230> teleport<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.940> that

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
trap up and when you teleport so that

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.790 
trap up and when you teleport so that
was<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.420> lumbridge<00:03:57.750> basement<00:03:58.200> trap<00:03:58.410> smuggle

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
was the lumbridge basement trap smuggle

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.350 
was the lumbridge basement trap smuggle
and<00:03:58.980> how<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.280> used<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.610> remove<00:03:59.790> game<00:04:00.060> tails

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and how it was used to remove game tails

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.540 
and how it was used to remove game tails
and<00:04:00.720> also<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.110> smuggle<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.770> frog<00:04:02.070> stands<00:04:02.370> from

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
and also to smuggle the frog stands from

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.570 
and also to smuggle the frog stands from
the<00:04:02.640> random<00:04:02.910> event<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> keep<00:04:05.459> these

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the random event so I have to keep these

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.920 
the random event so I have to keep these
episodes<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.209> little<00:04:06.390> bit<00:04:06.510> shorter<00:04:06.810> than

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
episodes a little bit shorter than

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.270 
episodes a little bit shorter than
legendary<00:04:07.350> glitches<00:04:07.709> because<00:04:08.040> legendary

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
legendary glitches because legendary

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.040 
legendary glitches because legendary
glitches<00:04:08.880> were<00:04:09.030> every<00:04:09.239> two<00:04:09.390> weeks<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.780> this

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
glitches were every two weeks and this

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.570 
glitches were every two weeks and this
series<00:04:10.320> I'm<00:04:10.590> trying<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:10.860> keep<00:04:11.010> up<00:04:11.160> with<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.400> big

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.010 
series I'm trying to keep up with a big
weekly<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.239> there<00:04:12.360> might<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.570> little<00:04:12.750> that's

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
weekly so there might be a little that's

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.060 
weekly so there might be a little that's
why<00:04:13.140> they're<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.380> bit<00:04:13.530> short<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.890> net

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
why they're a little bit short the net

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.979 
why they're a little bit short the net
