suits<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.730> clothes<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:58.320> we<00:04:58.530> put<00:04:58.830> on<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.610> that

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
suits of clothes that we put on so that

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.250 
suits of clothes that we put on so that
we<00:05:00.090> can<00:05:00.270> see<00:05:00.510> them<00:05:02.210> but<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:04.100> spent<00:05:05.100> an<00:05:05.280> enjoyable

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
we can see them but I spent an enjoyable

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.570 
we can see them but I spent an enjoyable
half<00:05:07.260> an<00:05:07.470> hour<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.800> don't<00:05:08.010> know<00:05:08.100> how<00:05:08.220> long<00:05:08.400> it

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
half an hour I don't know how long it

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.120 
half an hour I don't know how long it
was<00:05:08.870> in<00:05:09.870> conversation<00:05:10.830> with<00:05:11.030> this<00:05:13.130> entity

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
was in conversation with this entity

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.250 
was in conversation with this entity
until<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.150> all<00:05:15.300> sort<00:05:15.600> of<00:05:15.660> drifted<00:05:16.110> away<00:05:18.260> the

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
until it all sort of drifted away the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.480 
until it all sort of drifted away the
ritual<00:05:19.620> concluded<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:23.070> next<00:05:23.250> day<00:05:23.370> I

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
ritual concluded and the next day I

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.219 
ritual concluded and the next day I
checked<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.060> all<00:05:24.180> out<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.600> mean<00:05:24.810> one<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.050> the

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
checked it all out I mean one of the

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.090 
checked it all out I mean one of the
things<00:05:25.290> that<00:05:25.560> I'd<00:05:25.770> said<00:05:26.479> during<00:05:27.479> my

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
things that I'd said during my

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.740 
things that I'd said during my
conversation<00:05:29.100> with<00:05:29.550> his<00:05:29.850> entity<00:05:30.300> was<00:05:30.479> that<00:05:30.630> it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
conversation with his entity was that it

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.050 
conversation with his entity was that it
seemed<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.380> be<00:05:31.790> it<00:05:32.790> was<00:05:32.910> a<00:05:32.940> bit<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.180> show-off

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
seemed to be it was a bit of a show-off

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.330 
seemed to be it was a bit of a show-off
it<00:05:36.060> was<00:05:37.100> beautifully<00:05:38.100> artistic<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.950> was

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
it was beautifully artistic and it was

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.719 
it was beautifully artistic and it was
also<00:05:41.640> very<00:05:41.880> very<00:05:42.390> good<00:05:42.539> at<00:05:42.690> mathematics<00:05:43.729> that

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
also very very good at mathematics that

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.610 
also very very good at mathematics that
it<00:05:45.030> had<00:05:45.240> got<00:05:45.570> um<00:05:47.390> one<00:05:48.390> more<00:05:48.419> dimension<00:05:48.870> at

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
it had got um one more dimension at

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.450 
it had got um one more dimension at
least<00:05:50.120> than<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.270> three<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:51.720> we<00:05:51.900> are<00:05:51.960> used<00:05:52.229> to

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
least than the three that we are used to

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.400 
least than the three that we are used to
and<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.580> seemed<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.240> be<00:05:54.390> enjoying<00:05:54.510> showing<00:05:55.110> off

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
and it seemed to be enjoying showing off

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.529 
and it seemed to be enjoying showing off
that<00:05:55.440> fact<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.789> next<00:05:56.970> day<00:05:57.120> when<00:05:57.450> I

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
that fact and the next day when I

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.300 
that fact and the next day when I
actually<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:58.229> thought<00:05:58.830> all<00:05:58.950> right<00:05:59.100> I'm<00:05:59.190> going

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
actually I thought all right I'm going

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.020 
actually I thought all right I'm going
to<00:05:59.370> check<00:05:59.610> out<00:05:59.820> as<00:06:00.090> Molly's<00:06:01.729> I'm<00:06:02.729> going<00:06:02.970> to

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.300 
to check out as Molly's I'm going to
look<00:06:03.120> at<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.300> literature<00:06:03.680> because<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:05.130> wasn't

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
look at the literature because I wasn't

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.420 
look at the literature because I wasn't
that<00:06:05.580> familiar<00:06:06.030> with<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.240> name<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.919> I<00:06:07.919> found

out that he is a demon that is
associated<00:06:12.660> with<00:06:13.169> mathematics<00:06:14.130> right<00:06:14.940> and

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
associated with mathematics right and

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.400 
associated with mathematics right and
also<00:06:16.350> with<00:06:16.680> handicraft<00:06:18.080> which<00:06:19.080> was<00:06:19.260> exactly

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
also with handicraft which was exactly

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.029
