00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.780
 fiqas aalsmeer leads the handball 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.519
 Premier League 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.870
 after the win last week on 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.369
 volendam 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.859
 this season only has one more 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.080
 played a loss game and that was the 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.740
 away game against the opponents of 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 tonight 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.779
 the eurotech bevo hell slide combination 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.880
 tensions 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.670
 tonight's commitment is therefore to preserve 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.580
 the first place 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.860
 by the way, bevo is at number 4 and we are 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.620
 meanwhile started the twelfth 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.020
 competition round with a lot 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.540
 sloppiness and errors on both sides 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.590
 incidentally causing a messy 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.590
 competition unfolds 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.840
 first goal then from francs 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.270
 lubbert in the third minute 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.460
 Remco van dam long shot but 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.740
 stopped playing too easily 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.680
 best match is hardly coming 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.590
 good offensive actions and comes 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.650
 but little top score in this competition 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.930
 goal was the number 7 of eg 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.710
 eelco weavers and thus brings the state 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.350
 balanced in the 8th minute 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.690
 robomow the ball then comes back and then is 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.880
 the jewish stefanovic 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.370
 which ensures that fiqas aalsmeer anyway 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.640
 again on a cautious lead from 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.180
 three points albeit on a free 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.530
 difficult way still many mistakes 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.659
 and no excellence 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 the goals last them because there is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.790
 no less than five minutes 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 scored free goal from the circle 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.759
 fiqas aalsmeer does not have the defense 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 in order 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.550
 whereby bevo chance the connection is to 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.040
 search at a score of 9 equal 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.750
 again by a goal from eelco 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.700
 weavers 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.159
 Beverdam with four men will be at the end 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.930
 from the first half making vikas side 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 sees a few goals to go 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.429
 and the men go into the dressing room 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.269
 at a position of 13 9 than the second 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.160
 half 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.690
 fiqas aalsmeer makes a flashy one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.260
 restart 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.300
 and a violation at bevo martin vlijm 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.350
 the new trainer from bevo is ready 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.390
 to care 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.920
 then it is frank hubert who is the seven 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.900
 meter utilized 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.690
 fiqas aalsmeer is taking the lead 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 of eight points in the first 5 minutes 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.450
 from the second half and then there is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 whistled for running through remco van dam 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.680
 and wakes up with a quick one 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 counterattack 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.540
 and a great goal from Eelco 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.019
 weavers the number seven again brings the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.329
 stand at 1712 and is ahead of 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.940
 fiqas aalsmeer already reduced to 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.610
 a five points 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.890
 a miss from frank lubberts name the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.980
 flashy start of fiqas aalsmeer 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.410
 now it's bevo that hard on 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.840
 work is on a comeback here with 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.180
 a great goal from jeroen van 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.720
 the beech difference is only three 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.239
 points 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.000
 fiqas aalsmeer is not doing well 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.680
 competition and is now starting to be in real danger 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.970
 walk 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.250
 this is again a beautiful one 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.829
 Easter from waay tree to samir and leave 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.109
 b for is visible difficulty with it 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.209
 get off the circle playing free 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.739
 calls aalsmeer 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.140
 yet the smugglers are not with that 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.239
 really back in the competition and runs the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.579
 leading position in the premier league now 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.720
 serious danger 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.910
 this ball goes really bad 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.060
 easy in the nice range shot though 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.190
 from pim augustinus the number 8 from bevo 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.470
 difference is only one point 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.300
 aalsmeer and about language but by a to 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.640
 play wrong so know your heart too light 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.600
 it didn't score and this o-so 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.700
 important phase of the competition and the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.130
 equalizer is lurking 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.410
 and there he is then polman ship 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.630
 almost everything right low with a naughty 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.780
 relic abi bertje fano 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.950
 know but can hardly get it 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.960
 and honesty requires that 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.600
 fiqas aalsmeer tonight one of the 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.060
 weaker matches play offensive 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.190
 too little back and kick strength and 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.459
 defensively insufficient resistance to 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.850
 especially the number 79 there it is again 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.830
 dario polman stand 22 23 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.650
 play with just a few minutes 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.410
 is really only there 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.360
 an equal final score 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.240
 but then it must happen now 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.890
 Remco van Dam does that - he scores it 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.500
 final goal of the match 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.110
 fiqas aalsmeer must point and share with 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.290
 eurotech bevo spouts 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.000
 a competition full of sloppiness and mistakes 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.250
 in short a competition to come back again 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.060
 to watch on video and story of 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.710
 to learn 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.419
 2nd half picks up where I am very calm 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.730
 competent 17 9 for 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.890
 no mistake in the air and then krijn 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.260
 really easier goals against 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.880
 and and say yes we are the only 23 mine 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.140
 other side 3 dead against is very good 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.730
 only the went the 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.470
 can easily score goals in it 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.510
 defensively we might think had 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.100
 should have gone a step more and there 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.720
 we must learn from this and this 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.310
 are the matches I go afterwards 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.500
 piece maybe year bales a point 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.180
 lost where the last 30 seconds 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.260
 stand one find out again 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.270
 point inside 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.650
 so all in all i am not satisfied with 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.090
 this cake I would have preferred the points 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.900
 won because yes I already say eight goals 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.310
 in front of 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.610
 really does hanbal better 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.409
 a better play 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.090
 he i think we should be next 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.860
 watch this match in the video 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.120
 to analyze the good and we must 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.530
 to our advantage in the coming 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.370
 competitions and certainly trucks in this play 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.289
 or so a useful useful match this 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.789
 I think we didn't play 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.719
 to full chances that we are too fast 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.300
 closed off 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:46.310
 defensively you let those guys too 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.689
 easy shooting and then you have to 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.680
 his pom and in the middle you have to 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.840
 do it here 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.759
 that guy is cycling ronin and riding 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.080
 you have to get off that is not possible 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.520
 and you always see that lead 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.659
 we try to do everything 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.419
 to do but did it just 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:04.389
 fortunately did n't have another point in it 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.389
 about old but catholic the web
