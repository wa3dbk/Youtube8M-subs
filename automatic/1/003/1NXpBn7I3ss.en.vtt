fixes things that went wrong in

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.380 
fixes things that went wrong in
pre-release<00:00:28.380> 5<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:29.670> were<00:00:29.820> two<00:00:30.119> major

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pre-release 5 and there were two major

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.350 
pre-release 5 and there were two major
things<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.880> quite<00:00:33.180> went<00:00:33.390> wrong<00:00:33.649> so

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
things that really quite went wrong so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.850 
things that really quite went wrong so
first<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:36.540> take<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> look<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.050> used<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
first let's take a look at what used to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
first let's take a look at what used to
be<00:00:37.920> wrong<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.350> may

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
be wrong so as you can see and you may

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.060 
be wrong so as you can see and you may
remember<00:00:41.430> from<00:00:41.840> pre-release<00:00:42.840> 5<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.410> water<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
remember from pre-release 5 on water and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.319 
remember from pre-release 5 on water and
particles<00:00:44.879> did<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.230> any<00:00:46.440> effect<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
particles did not take any effect of the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
particles did not take any effect of the
actual<00:00:48.690> surrounding<00:00:49.170> light<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.100> would

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
actual surrounding light so they would

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.569 
actual surrounding light so they would
always<00:00:51.260> show<00:00:52.260> graphics<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.520> were

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
always show graphics like they were

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
always show graphics like they were
covered<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.420> light<00:00:55.579> rather<00:00:56.579> weed<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
covered in light rather weed and the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
covered in light rather weed and the
second<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.219> say<00:00:59.370> over<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.850> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
second thing you can say over here is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
second thing you can say over here is
that<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> beacons<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that the beacons have a little bit of a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.939 
that the beacons have a little bit of a
glitchy<00:01:02.820> beam<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.710> way

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
glitchy beam you can see that it's way

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.649 
glitchy beam you can see that it's way
thicker<00:01:05.220> than<00:01:05.729> its<00:01:05.970> supposed<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.659> that

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
thicker than its supposed to be and that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.620 
thicker than its supposed to be and that
has<00:01:09.840> also<00:01:10.020> been<00:01:10.229> fixed<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.600> in

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
has also been fixed so here we are in

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.679 
has also been fixed so here we are in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
can see we have back or normal beacon

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.429 
can see we have back or normal beacon
beams<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.950> used<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.909> them

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
beams just like we used to know them

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
beams just like we used to know them
just<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.590> check<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.220> i<00:01:29.909> mean<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.390> to

just to check it just i mean just to
make<00:01:30.689> sure<00:01:30.979> they<00:01:31.979> work<00:01:32.189> fine<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:33.030> work<00:01:33.240> just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
brought gone wrong just quite a little

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.630 
brought gone wrong just quite a little

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
bit i don't want to create risky holes

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.990 
bit i don't want to create risky holes
let's<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> look<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> water<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> water

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
let's take a look at the water the water

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.780 
let's take a look at the water the water
is<00:01:54.180> dark<00:01:54.450> again<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.590> let's<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.610> like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
is dark again now let's see if we like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.420 
is dark again now let's see if we like
cover<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.790> cover<00:02:00.060> ourselves<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:01.020> well

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
cover it like we cover ourselves as well

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.170 
cover it like we cover ourselves as well
so<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.119> sure<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.079> works

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
so we can know for sure that it works

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.070 
so we can know for sure that it works
yeah<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.420> water<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.869> dark

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
yeah the water is just dark

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.410 
yeah the water is just dark
it's<00:02:08.770> just<00:02:09.070> dark<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.180> way<00:02:10.270> it's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
it's just dark it's just the way it's

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's just dark it's just the way it's
supposed<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.260> be<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.820> pre-release<00:02:13.270> 6

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
supposed to be so this pre-release 6

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.910 
supposed to be so this pre-release 6
fixes<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.350> major<00:02:14.620> two<00:02:14.920> bugs<00:02:15.220> with<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.560> beacon

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
fixes the major two bugs with the beacon

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.150 
fixes the major two bugs with the beacon
beams<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.510> water<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.990> mean<00:02:20.560> both<00:02:20.770> water

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
beams and the water I mean both water

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.070 
beams and the water I mean both water
and<00:02:21.250> particles<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:21.970> taking<00:02:22.330> effect<00:02:22.570> off<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and particles not taking effect off the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.340 
and particles not taking effect off the
surrounding<00:02:23.380> light<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.810> was<00:02:25.990> basically

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
surrounding light so this was basically

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.310 
surrounding light so this was basically
