have been following us you guys have

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
have been following us you guys have
seen<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.149> big<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.660> monster<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.230> things

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
seen how big and on monster these things

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.060 
seen how big and on monster these things
are<00:00:46.649> 600<00:00:47.550> rms<00:00:47.940> 1200<00:00:48.480> max

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
are 600 rms 1200 max

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
are 600 rms 1200 max
and<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.789> them<00:00:50.879> wired<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> at

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and right now we got them wired up at

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
and right now we got them wired up at
two-and-a-half<00:00:51.660> homes<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> amplifier

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
two-and-a-half homes so this amplifier

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160 
two-and-a-half homes so this amplifier
is<00:00:53.039> only<00:00:53.250> putting<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.640> half<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> power

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
is only putting out half the power

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
is only putting out half the power
keep<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> mind<00:00:56.129> though<00:00:56.309> guys<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:57.000> have

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
keep in mind though guys we do have

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
keep in mind though guys we do have
three<00:00:57.840> batteries<00:00:58.320> back<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> can

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

amplifiers and I don't know it's
powerful<00:03:45.280> are<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:46.459> doing<00:03:46.730> something

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
powerful are we doing something

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.030 
powerful are we doing something
different<00:03:47.420> than<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.630> guys<00:03:47.840> are<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.680> only<00:03:48.920> way

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040

out<00:03:53.120> out<00:03:53.330> there<00:03:53.950> also<00:03:54.950> keep<00:03:55.190> in<00:03:55.340> mind<00:03:55.690> we're

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
out out there also keep in mind we're

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.390 
out out there also keep in mind we're
running<00:03:56.959> three<00:03:57.140> batteries<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:57.980> helping

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
running three batteries is that helping

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.560 
running three batteries is that helping
well<00:03:58.580> of<00:03:58.700> course<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:59.060> does<00:03:59.239> because<00:03:59.450> they're

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
well of course it does because they're

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.360 
well of course it does because they're
all<00:03:59.690> tied<00:03:59.900> together<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.470> point<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.130> we're

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
all tied together the point is we're

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.220 
all tied together the point is we're
running<00:04:01.489> one<00:04:02.390> four<00:04:02.930> gauge<00:04:03.140> input<00:04:03.530> that's<00:04:04.130> it

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
running one four gauge input that's it

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.289 
running one four gauge input that's it
four<00:04:06.230> gauge<00:04:06.380> input<00:04:06.799> never<00:04:07.640> mind<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.090> guys

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
four gauge input never mind this guys

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.449 
four gauge input never mind this guys
this<00:04:08.510> doesn't<00:04:08.870> work<00:04:09.019> but<00:04:09.739> actually<00:04:10.100> reading

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
this doesn't work but actually reading

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.420 
this doesn't work but actually reading
the<00:04:11.120> routine<00:04:11.510> point<00:04:11.810> nine<00:04:12.049> volts<00:04:12.350> you<00:04:13.220> can't

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the routine point nine volts you can't

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.890 
the routine point nine volts you can't
really<00:04:13.580> see<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.820> there<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:14.269> we're<00:04:14.660> reading

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
really see it there but we're reading

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.479 
really see it there but we're reading
thirteen<00:04:15.290> point<00:04:15.530> nine<00:04:15.590> volts<00:04:16.100> with<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> car

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
thirteen point nine volts with the car

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.280 
thirteen point nine volts with the car
off<00:04:16.700> with<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.239> car<00:04:17.419> on<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.750> reads<00:04:17.900> fourteen

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
off with the car on it reads fourteen

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.490 
off with the car on it reads fourteen
point<00:04:18.500> two<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.150> again<00:04:20.150> gosh<00:04:20.810> can't<00:04:21.229> excite

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
point two and again gosh can't excite

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.080 
point two and again gosh can't excite
enough<00:04:21.769> on<00:04:21.950> these<00:04:22.070> amplifiers<00:04:22.430> guys<00:04:22.850> they're

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
enough on these amplifiers guys they're

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.240 
enough on these amplifiers guys they're
amazing<00:04:23.630> they're<00:04:23.750> powerful<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.560> they're

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
amazing they're powerful and they're

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.640 
amazing they're powerful and they're
they're<00:04:25.850> small<00:04:26.450> they<00:04:26.870> can<00:04:27.050> fit<00:04:27.260> almost

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
they're small they can fit almost

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.400 
they're small they can fit almost
anywhere<00:04:28.150> alright<00:04:29.150> hopefully<00:04:29.750> uh<00:04:30.020> if<00:04:30.290> we
