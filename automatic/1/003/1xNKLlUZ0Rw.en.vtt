00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.790
 welcome to a new appointment with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.760
 know the mushrooms by my side fabio 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.650
 padovan mycologist today what we talk about 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.530
 today we are talking about a mushroom that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 fairly widespread in our forests that 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 it's called clito pilu sprung luz is a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 mushroom let's say average size 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.470
 small 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.390
 it goes from 23 cm in diameter to the maximum 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 5 6 centimeters but rarely found 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 so great and and to know 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.730
 carefully because it is possible is a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 film it is an edible mushroom 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 for now it is possible to confuse it complete 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.850
 or poisonous white foods so it's good 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.399
 know the ok characters well 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.190
 let's approach let's see how it is 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:16.350
 has the surface of the hat is 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.780
 a dry surface that varies by 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.320
 color from pure white as in some 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.720
 grayish white specimens 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.330
 slightly brown ie no lane in 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 some specimens 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.570
 the surface as I said is dry and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.850
 the slats that are almost finely velvety 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 we find below are enough lamellas 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 a little bit of current on the stem ed 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.900
 they have the peculiarity of becoming pink 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.619
 then summarizes the pink tones in the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.590
 ripe mushrooms you see here in this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.670
 specimen that the lamellas have assumed 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.670
 a pink color 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.250
 the stem is rather short normally 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.209
 a little curved, not always straight 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 slightly that washed in some 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:17.640
 specimens and presents a base with a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 whitish mycelium the flesh of this 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.569
 mushroom and an extremely soft flesh 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.319
 fragile indeed breaks with an extreme 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.170
 easiness 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.299
 we see that it is a white meat and if we 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.400
 let's try to smell this 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.739
 fungus if we perceive a distinct smell of 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.810
 fresh flour I can ask you a question yes 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.410
 it is true that you have known this mushroom 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.540
 also with the name of spy of porcino is 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.519
 true it is true that this smoke is called 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.069
 also spy of the porcino here we spy 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.230
 of the hold because because you est it 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.599
 same ecological needs as porcini 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.940
 therefore this fungus is often found 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.739
 in the same place where i 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.889
 porcini for this I called spy of 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.420
 porcino we can confirm it today is 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.709
 we can confirm it but we care 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.840
 for us 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.880
 so now this is ours 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.560
 secret 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.470
