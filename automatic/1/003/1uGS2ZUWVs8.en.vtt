00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.860
 well we're all here with craig and 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.889
 we are going to basically bring the new 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.160
 the legendary dx kindle by the way is 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.039
 power guardian spirit and good here the 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.660
 we have at the moment without forms as you see 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:22.750
 He is a strong muscular human 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.789
 and now let's make the animations not 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.269
 will say anything is worth 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.519
 in it one control 2 is uncontrolled 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.519
 does nothing the dance is done 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.460
 there we are 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:44.270
 and control 4 the laugh I have to say that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.610
 varies with form in each 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.440
 every aspect that it has in what it says 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.120
 with control 1 control 2 and those things 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 and the dance also changes a bit 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.470
 and laughter because the spirits appear 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.140
 guardians 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.640
 this is when when you kill the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.580
 dragon and the baron also says things 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 specials and has a lot of phrases 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.799
 additional 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.799
 we'll see 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.830
 and this we are going to put in the form of fire 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.670
 what do you see how it gets 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.500
 look at this is the way the turtle how 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.460
 It gets shape of the s 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.020
 in the form of happy ok 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.610
 we go with the dance of the form of the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.119
 dance and things in a de facto way 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.119
 come on 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 white 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.700
 will be the control of also the dancing 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.759
 in the table 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.759
 we go with the turtle 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.890
 the control 2 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.820
 dance 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.560

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.100
 Hello 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.100
 the form of that 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.900
 I have to say that they have a phrase in 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.790
 turtle shape just like what I've 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 said that says nothing should I say 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.030
 something 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.080
 the dance 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.970
 and it appears in the background and as you can see they are all 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.720
 equal more or less is this the phrase of 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.720
 control 1 control 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.700
 he says he was left with his mentioned how much 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.920
 and as you see the happy also smiling 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 It must be said that when you shop at 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.430
 the champion who for a few days goes to 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.430
 be worth in nineteen and peak 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.500
 and then it's going to get to 3,250 when you 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.400
 shopping the champion you also get a 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.519
 a bar bands 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.500
 some icons invoked and a line in 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.200

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.470
 world as to what you're worth for 2,250 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.460
 for a few days to take it out later 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.410

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.660
 well let's show you the attacks 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.480

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.829
 in the way they did to evolve from 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.829

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.810

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.260
 another order of fire 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.690
 and we are very well and now we are going to 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.530

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.720

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.060
 bear shape 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.060
