00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
are kind of interesting in the sense of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
are kind of interesting in the sense of
I<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.380> sort<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> technique

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I don't know what sort of technique

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
again but if you like it okay just just

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
again but if you like it okay just just
know<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> next<00:01:44.430> ribbon<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.840> actually

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
know that the next ribbon will actually

know that the next ribbon will actually
be<00:01:46.530> white<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> color<00:01:48.299> of

buds if it's really artificially colored
the<00:02:09.780> buds<00:02:09.989> will<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.319> colored<00:02:10.739> all<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.250> way

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the buds will be colored all the way

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.809 
the buds will be colored all the way
to<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.230> tip<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.069> won't<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.489> green

depending<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.650> variety<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.819> orchid

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
depending on the variety of the orchid

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.319 
depending on the variety of the orchid
but<00:02:27.840> when<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.500> dyed<00:02:28.769> orchid<00:02:29.370> all<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.120> buds

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
but when it's a dyed orchid all the buds

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.809 
but when it's a dyed orchid all the buds
will<00:02:30.629> take<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.260> color<00:02:31.560> also<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.610> flower

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
will take that color also the flower

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.059 
will take that color also the flower
spike<00:02:33.239> will<00:02:33.480> tend<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.440> shade<00:02:34.799> as

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
spike will tend to have that shade as

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.520 
spike will tend to have that shade as
well<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.090> rather<00:02:36.390> slightly<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.379> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
well if you rather slightly and the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.380 
well if you rather slightly and the
orchid<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.950> slightly<00:02:38.250> moist<00:02:38.640> you'll<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.239> it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
orchid is slightly moist you'll see it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.740 
orchid is slightly moist you'll see it
on<00:02:39.450> your<00:02:39.659> hands<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.650> dye<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.190> comes<00:02:41.430> off

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
on your hands the dye just comes off

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.119 
on your hands the dye just comes off
sometimes<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.019> orchid<00:02:43.319> can<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:43.860> drip

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
sometimes the orchid can actually drip

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.280 
sometimes the orchid can actually drip
the<00:02:44.310> dye<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.000> look<00:02:45.269> at<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> leaves<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.109> see

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the dye so look at the leaves if you see

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.670 
the dye so look at the leaves if you see
any<00:02:46.440> spots<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.099> same<00:02:47.280> color<00:02:47.609> most<00:02:48.680> obvious

one<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.650> definitely<00:02:58.920> died<00:02:59.609> now<00:03:00.540> I'm<00:03:00.659> not<00:03:00.810> sure

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
one is definitely died now I'm not sure

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.649 
one is definitely died now I'm not sure
what<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.379> effects<00:03:01.799> on<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> long<00:03:02.220> term<00:03:02.659> for

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
what the effects on the long term for

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.740 
what the effects on the long term for
the<00:03:03.690> orchid<00:03:04.170> are<00:03:04.379> I'm<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.340> sure<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.239> really

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the orchid are I'm not sure I really

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.899 
the orchid are I'm not sure I really
don't<00:03:06.930> think<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.440> anything<00:03:07.920> toxic<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.640> think

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
don't think is anything toxic I think

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.470 
don't think is anything toxic I think
they<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.030> use<00:03:09.959> food<00:03:10.530> dyes<00:03:10.950> natural<00:03:11.879> I'm<00:03:12.299> not

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
they just use food dyes natural I'm not

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
they just use food dyes natural I'm not
sure<00:03:12.599> if<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.840> natural<00:03:13.260> dye<00:03:13.409> but<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:13.859> food

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
sure if it's natural dye but it's food

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.670 
sure if it's natural dye but it's food
dye<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:15.599> dangerous<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.530> can

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
dye so it's not dangerous and you can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.559 
dye so it's not dangerous and you can
actually<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> pretty<00:03:17.639> healthy<00:03:17.970> orchid

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
actually have a pretty healthy orchid

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.930 
actually have a pretty healthy orchid
it's<00:03:18.989> just<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.709> will<00:03:19.859> now<00:03:20.069> rebloom<00:03:20.579> with

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
it's just that it will now rebloom with

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.140 
it's just that it will now rebloom with
the<00:03:21.090> same<00:03:21.269> color<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.900> will<00:03:22.200> rebloom<00:03:22.829> white<00:03:23.400> so

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
