00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
just start making a hydrate where they

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.630 
just start making a hydrate where they
right<00:00:57.710> where<00:00:57.829> they<00:00:57.950> are<00:00:58.040> if<00:00:58.160> they<00:00:58.250> can't<00:00:58.430> find

right where they are if they can't find
a<00:00:58.670> suitable<00:00:58.790> place<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.510> we're<00:01:00.230> gonna<00:01:00.320> get<00:01:00.500> in

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
a suitable place so we're gonna get in

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.310 
a suitable place so we're gonna get in
there<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.770> see<00:01:00.980> what<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:01.129> can<00:01:01.190> find<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.320> I'm

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
there and see what we can find and I'm

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.320 
there and see what we can find and I'm
gonna<00:01:03.500> I'm<00:01:03.739> gonna<00:01:03.920> gear<00:01:04.070> up<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:04.850> let's<00:01:05.360> go

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.609 

there<00:01:11.330> might<00:01:11.509> be<00:01:11.539> a<00:01:11.660> few<00:01:11.930> more<00:01:12.080> bees<00:01:12.289> than<00:01:12.320> I

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
there might be a few more bees than I

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.680 
there might be a few more bees than I
thought<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.070> there<00:01:13.450> probably<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.479> would<00:01:14.660> say

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
thought in there probably I would say

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.800 
thought in there probably I would say
between<00:01:15.369> two<00:01:16.369> two<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.789> a<00:01:16.850> half<00:01:16.970> pounds<00:01:17.569> so

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
between two two and a half pounds so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.050 
between two two and a half pounds so
maybe<00:01:18.170> close<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.709> seven<00:01:19.130> eight<00:01:19.250> seven<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.910> ten

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
maybe close to seven eight seven to ten

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.540 
maybe close to seven eight seven to ten
thousand<00:01:20.479> bees<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.709> course<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.130> got<00:01:22.280> some
