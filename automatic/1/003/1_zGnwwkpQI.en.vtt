00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 come on the first video on the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.250
 channel fsx rtl 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.840
 I do not know what we always say 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.660
 want today is about a problem that 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.730
 I had and I know that too 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 pretty annoying can mean 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.210
 big house on minecraft has 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.140
 I also called microsoft and the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 have not helped much there either 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.150
 the problem is that can not be 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 uninstall and installed a lot 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.400
 functionally next to forget to say 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.269
 but okay i have a solution now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.110
 found to 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.660
 It may be that during the installation 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 to affect a windows installer package 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 the problem is present or at the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.110
 deinstall stands that the software 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.399
 is installed or something in the frame 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.500
 the installation was performed 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.289
 I want to just show a solution 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.809
 which is actually quite simple 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 a little bit but see what to do 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.469
 this is how it works first on the computer 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.050
 how this works should be everything 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.329
 i know i am now windows 7 at the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.399
 animal will be his workplace is here 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.880
 can I therefore believe computer 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.910
 here computer shows 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.380
 So people are the microsoft most industrious 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.490
 dvd 1 1 car ran so do not install 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.810
 but goes on it expresses opens 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.070
 then he wanted to be completely on top of that 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.800
 normal and then you have one here 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.180
 I did not know any files 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.730
 Something in any case attracts you 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.130
 all these files which ye have to 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.320
 the desktop is just like that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.100
 then we pull all these files 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.610
 here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.080
 It takes time then it can depending on 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.640
 computer 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.310
 be different with me while 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.020
 usually four minutes to say 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.360
 make the campus the same way and soon 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.890
 then you pulled the dvd 1 into the folder 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.310
 You could call her like you 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.020
 want 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.270
 should also be on the desktop his mother 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.670
 is ready for the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:06.820
 Two and a half times will be done again 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:11.470
 the same procedure as the smaller one 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.810
 tip if that was so long invited yes 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.570
 generally discuss from number to long 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.390
 takes if it takes more than an hour 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.860
 and you actually have such a computer 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.570
 then just let them open before the election 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.890
 some people should do the tricks 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.720
 People know I do not know why that 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.620
 I could pass my mine 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 Write comments why 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 unfortunately runs zack and it is there then 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.070
 we take the whole files here too 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.310
 and pull that also copied again and 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.110
 then if you then the dvd 2 in yours 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.520
 folder as depending on how you like that 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.460
 Of course, I have called you all 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.870
 leave copied Merkel is my father 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.670
 Share already here presses 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.470
 just do not copy 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.350
 here you have to copy in any case 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.180
 So yes, that is very important because 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.180
 otherwise it works of course press 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.800
 also for everyone so easy 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.870
 Express without this extra so 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.060
 also does not copy anything 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.890
 copy not copy copy so that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.200
 whole will then that makes me the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.670
 folder and now comes the actual 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.360
 most important step of all the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.440
 redemption of the problem presses on the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.010
 sc kartner presses on setup exe in sdk 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.390
 and then it looks white exactly 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.299
 what is the first carlson of it 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.530
 Something for developers, I think 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.720
 then install that for then 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.570
 everything and then I would say we see 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.250
 maybe it will be like that again 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.920
 is installed she goes to yours 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.360
 depending on how the system 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.830
 you are with me it is now 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.540
 on category that you can turn around 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.580
 category or depending on what comedy 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.989
 install and also gives in the search 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.280
 one remains Platzeck to myself is he 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.390
 already installed flatex, of course 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.020
 installed because the sdk very important 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.490
 sdk services like that 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.490
 to change the step by 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:32.690
 should the window too 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:35.690
 so I want that's important because then 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 also deleted the registry entries 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:46.520
 holder to lead that one not the fsx 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:47.810
 intended to install and install 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.669
 when the group finishes it works 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.060
 here the folder where you the cds 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.860
 has pulled in tata pixel as 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.940
 run administrator and then should 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.360
 Actually, everything works, I do 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.360
 not now
