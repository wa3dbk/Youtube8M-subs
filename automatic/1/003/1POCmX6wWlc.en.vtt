different<00:04:11.370> kind<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.579> questions<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:13.380> most

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
different kind of questions so for most

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.900 
different kind of questions so for most
of<00:04:13.829> history<00:04:14.780> therefore<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:17.130> person<00:04:17.160> carried

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
of history therefore if a person carried

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.199 
of history therefore if a person carried
a<00:04:18.000> weapon<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.600> was<00:04:18.780> generally<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.650> sidearm<00:04:20.430> okay

a weapon it was generally a sidearm okay
it's<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.450> very<00:04:21.479> useful<00:04:21.840> term<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:23.039> have<00:04:23.370> often

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
it's a very useful term and I have often

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.640 
it's a very useful term and I have often
made<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.690> point<00:04:24.990> that

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
made the point that

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.670 
made the point that
swords<00:04:26.009> are<00:04:26.160> sidearms<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.330> is<00:04:27.570> one<00:04:28.530> of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
swords are sidearms and that is one of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.640 
swords are sidearms and that is one of
the<00:04:28.800> reasons<00:04:29.190> why<00:04:29.400> swords<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.990> sword<00:04:31.380> like

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
journey respecting one reason and they

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.810 
journey respecting one reason and they
had<00:06:23.580> to<00:06:23.699> carry<00:06:23.820> a<00:06:24.000> weapon<00:06:24.180> because<00:06:25.280> that<00:06:26.280> route

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
had to carry a weapon because that route

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.570 
had to carry a weapon because that route
wasn't<00:06:27.270> safe<00:06:27.539> they<00:06:28.530> would<00:06:28.740> generally<00:06:29.010> carry

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
wasn't safe they would generally carry

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.939

weapons<00:06:30.240> which<00:06:30.419> are<00:06:30.599> very<00:06:30.780> easy<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.440> carry<00:06:31.710> and

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
weapons which are very easy to carry and

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.070 
weapons which are very easy to carry and
they<00:06:32.340> would<00:06:32.490> generally<00:06:32.880> only<00:06:33.180> carry<00:06:33.449> one<00:06:33.690> or

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080

they would generally only carry one or
two<00:06:34.229> weapons<00:06:34.560> at<00:06:34.680> most<00:06:34.889> ok<00:06:35.490> so<00:06:35.909> if<00:06:36.060> we<00:06:36.210> look<00:06:36.389> at

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
two weapons at most ok so if we look at

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.350 
two weapons at most ok so if we look at
medieval<00:06:37.020> Europe<00:06:37.409> it<00:06:37.770> was<00:06:37.919> very<00:06:38.190> common<00:06:38.580> for

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
did they carry any more than that so

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.459 
did they carry any more than that so
this<00:06:58.919> idea<00:06:59.129> from<00:06:59.759> games<00:07:00.270> like<00:07:00.659> em<00:07:01.289> you<00:07:01.349> know

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:01.469 
this idea from games like em you know

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.950 
this idea from games like em you know
Diablo<00:07:02.039> or<00:07:02.069> Skyrim<00:07:02.819> or<00:07:03.180> these<00:07:03.360> kind<00:07:03.719> of<00:07:03.750> things

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
Diablo or Skyrim or these kind of things

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.020 
Diablo or Skyrim or these kind of things
where<00:07:04.199> you<00:07:04.439> can<00:07:04.860> carry<00:07:05.159> like<00:07:05.430> maybe<00:07:05.819> you'll

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
where you can carry like maybe you'll

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.939 
where you can carry like maybe you'll
carry<00:07:06.300> through<00:07:06.599> swords<00:07:06.870> and<00:07:07.229> two<00:07:07.379> daggers<00:07:07.590> and

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:14.209 
spear
it's<00:07:12.150> just<00:07:12.509> absolutely<00:07:12.689> really<00:07:13.379> ridiculous

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219 
it's just absolutely really ridiculous

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.820 
it's just absolutely really ridiculous
it<00:07:14.370> has<00:07:14.490> no<00:07:14.789> place<00:07:15.060> in<00:07:15.090> history<00:07:15.719> or<00:07:16.229> realistic

fit into an everyday life okay so think

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.459 
fit into an everyday life okay so think
about<00:07:23.250> that<00:07:23.639> and<00:07:23.879> think<00:07:23.909> about<00:07:24.779> when<00:07:25.319> you're

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:25.469 
about that and think about when you're

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:26.719 
about that and think about when you're
talking<00:07:25.740> about<00:07:25.770> what<00:07:26.039> weapons<00:07:26.400> you<00:07:26.460> might

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:30.769 
carry in a certain place or a certain
time<00:07:28.740> think<00:07:29.430> about<00:07:29.490> what's<00:07:29.759> really<00:07:30.120> practical

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:30.779 
time think about what's really practical

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.279 
time think about what's really practical
and<00:07:31.080> imagine<00:07:31.560> going<00:07:31.919> about<00:07:32.129> your<00:07:32.189> daily<00:07:32.699> life
