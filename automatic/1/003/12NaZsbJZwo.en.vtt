00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.770
 This hit a two a silver slate 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.250
 It is an American version that is very close to usar on the Japanese side. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.820
 It is the first time this line passes to America 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.740
 It was selling in the named freedom bytes called tx 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.320
 What was ten times it was abrasion resistance? 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.630
 At the time when I was developing that line 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.129
 What is the most necessary line element for Mr. Daito excerpt 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 It is different from me being asked whether it is the strength of strong 1 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 A bus is a fish that is easily accessible to structure-oriented fish obstacles in its character 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.020
 I have to pull out from there with a great deal of easy access to the cover and such 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.340
 From 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.550
 There is no one on the road 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 It and I'm characteristic of this lure fishing 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.800
 The number of castings is more than any fishing 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:05.260
 Moreover, because the initial speed is fast 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.110
 When the lure is exhibited that line is passing through the guide at a great speed 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.910
 is not it 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:15.980
 Then there is another Mars friction heat there as the beginning 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.650
 Guide the wound's Toka abrasion resistance from rubbing against the various places of only extremely high sprout 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:24.360
 It is easy to use 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.270
 Tell me that I think that is probably the element I want most to the line in bass fishing 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.560
 How long should I set the timer 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.680
 Quite the in say 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.390
 It was technically difficult to improve the 10% and 20% abrasion resistance itself 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.740
 One day 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 Only that day 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.950
 People in the development staff change their ideas 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 Abrasion resistance exceeded 10 times when we changed material and combination of various things 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.250
 Until the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.850
 In my American side Nde say guy ... he like phantom 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.390
 Name it 10 times 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.210
 On the American side 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:09.590
 It's not a great time to start selling it 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:14.150
 It was added a little more soft and it was opened a 24 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.300
 It is the sar that is sold in Japan that it was made according to the field of Japan 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:24.350
 is not it 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.350
 This is a line improvement banner that emphasizes the first wear resistance that passed to the United States
