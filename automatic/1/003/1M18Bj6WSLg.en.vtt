00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.080 
exclusionary ounce 1.4 ounces
I<00:02:09.649> don't<00:02:10.310> think<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.519> coupon<00:02:10.819> had<00:02:11.000> an

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I don't think this coupon had an

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.690 
I don't think this coupon had an
exclusionary<00:02:11.629> ounce<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.440> either<00:02:12.560> way<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.580> was

exclusionary ounce but either way it was

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.670 
exclusionary ounce but either way it was
50<00:02:13.970> cents<00:02:14.180> off<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.720> those<00:02:14.870> these<00:02:15.140> are<00:02:15.260> 50<00:02:15.500> cents

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
50 cents off so those these are 50 cents

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
coupon thing it is a bit of a struggle

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.860 
coupon thing it is a bit of a struggle
for<00:03:46.790> them<00:03:47.030> because<00:03:47.150> they<00:03:47.329> do<00:03:47.419> not<00:03:47.599> have<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.470 
for them because they do not have the
scanner<00:03:48.430> but<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.730> think<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.329> they<00:03:50.450> are

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.720 
scanner but I think that they are
definitely<00:03:50.959> coming<00:03:51.260> around<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.040> all<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.579> well

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
definitely coming around and all is well

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.680 
definitely coming around and all is well
because<00:03:52.940> there<00:03:53.060> are<00:03:53.090> certainly<00:03:53.329> good<00:03:53.510> deals

because there are certainly good deals

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.970 
because there are certainly good deals
