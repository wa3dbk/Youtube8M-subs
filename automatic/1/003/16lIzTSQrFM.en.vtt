00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
our bodega it's been done for a little

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.939 
our bodega it's been done for a little
while<00:00:23.480> but<00:00:23.839> we<00:00:24.230> didn't<00:00:24.439> really<00:00:24.529> like<00:00:24.800> the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
while but we didn't really like the

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.220 
while but we didn't really like the
color<00:00:25.220> that<00:00:25.460> we<00:00:25.550> picked<00:00:25.849> some<00:00:26.090> repainting<00:00:26.840> it

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
color that we picked some repainting it

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.319 
color that we picked some repainting it
we<00:00:27.529> got<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.769> paint<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.340> doors<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:29.059> some<00:00:29.239> of

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
we got to paint the doors and some of

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.749 
we got to paint the doors and some of
the<00:00:29.390> metal<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.140> varnish<00:00:30.710> all<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:30.980> wood<00:00:31.189> and

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
the metal and varnish all the wood and
