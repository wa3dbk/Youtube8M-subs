00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.450
 hello everyone as this year I am 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.770
 nightmare 'and welcome to this new 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.440
 video a lot you are asking me 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.240
 as he did to buy more and more 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.500
 characters inside the game because it 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.599
 they realized that it was from a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.310
 way quite often and they told me 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.009
 nightmare how are you but to buy 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.599
 more characters in the game or a 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.579
 way as often as you're doing 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.079
 and well it's pretty simple I decided 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.480
 share this little advice with 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.399
 you good the way I am 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.250
 knowing more ip or points of influence 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.440
 within the game is through the new 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.260
 game that implemented radio within the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.730
 ego play ians that is aram mode is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.380
 something they implemented a few weeks ago 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.870
 the truth is quite fun 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.080
 love playing with my friends we had 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.300
 really so with lots of fun and 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.430
 it's pretty quick to finish the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.030
 games come to take about 20 or 30 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.129
 minutes 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.840
 and you get a good amount of 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.260
 experience and points of influence 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.150
 within the game now besides that is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.580
 quite funny this aram mode 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.740
 It will also allow them to try new 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.259
 characters within the game and also 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.659
 why not try some plays because 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.640
 the way they will practically be pure 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.250
 team fight or fights between teams 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.830
 then you can practice these aspects 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 and after practice they can put it 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.450
 to test inside the system game 5 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.429
 against 5 normal in the somni rif then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.960
 nothing good mode aram to tell them is 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.539
 Pretty funny the games are 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.770
 really short that you can experience 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.750
 to try new new characters 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.369
 played but as I tell you it also gives you 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 a good amount of points 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.229
 experience and points of influence 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 inside the game if you win a game you 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.420
 is giving around 80 points if 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's the first game of the day I think 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.190
 that doubles the amount arrived some 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.170
 around 150 seats and around 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.840
 about 150 points and in the first game 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.180
 earned of the day if you lose a game of 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.800
 arante gives as 45 points 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.150
 but obviously if you go with your friends 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.280
 you are more likely to win 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.869
 split even if it goes alone life is a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.580
 very good chance of winning a 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.610
 departure from aram 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.220
 and let's see 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.490
 the normal game mode of 5 against 5 in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.700
 the sound and I think you're winning 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.560
 around 100 points per game and if 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.470
 it's the first game won of the day 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.860
 I will give about 200 points if you lose the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.630
 starting get around 150 points and 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.390
 the games that come to take of about 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.100
 40 to 60 minutes you know a little bit more 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.830
 little less good if the other way around are from 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.840
 between 40 and 60 minutes the games of 5 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.420
 against 5 normal in sum the roger 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.090
 then doing accounts I gave myself and I 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.730
 I realized that the games in the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.980
 way to me they were shorter they gave me more 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.170
 experience because he was good with my 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.700
 friends and we won easier to win 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.130
 more easily what these games are 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.350
 they give us more experience and good what 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.970
 we make a faster way then 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.110
 well that's how I get more points 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.260
 of influence within the game in what 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.700
 particular, it helps me a lot and that 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.010
 It's the way I've gotten 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.050
 more points and I could buy more 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.660
 champions within the game as well as 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.810
 also buy some routes in the same 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.700
 game 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.959
 and well nothing that is the little advice 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.270
 that I give them the truth 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.310
 in this way they will do to get more 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.050
 experience and more points of influence 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.940
 As I tell you, it's serving me 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.860
 but good and it depends on you but not 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.030
 to see what if it works or leave it 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.500
