00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 and welcome to this new aid to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.710
 income in this new region 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 these machines 245 and offered a tutorial on 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.190
 downing kraft issa guÃ¨ye so a little 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.010
 portal mine it will therefore already returned 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.590
 the portal this will be like that so a 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.150
 desert gate any block one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.449
 do not care it's not very serious 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.550
 duclos I do not know how to try on blogs 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.119
 of glass I can not tell you finally the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:36.380
 windows fast like that I can not you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.980
 say so trade winds crossed the part if 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 it works too 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 but maybe it's rectangle it works 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.410
 also for example like that yes 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.180
 so any blog I think we 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.489
 is obliged to put a wall 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.940
 behind because otherwise it blocks if they 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:03.769
 not well I had big buzz me 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 so the surrender so you created in 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.040
 the occurrence had created so trout 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.660
 or how to create the portal first you 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.770
 have the new gates creed and give you 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.270
 the name your cell phone me I called it 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.160
 close by you give the place where there is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.110
 will have the portal ie the portal 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:32.030
 lazard like that so there will be here 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:36.860
 would be cynical gate the occassion and no 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.520
 of your portal so it's more like me 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.619
 it's rather rare and so you 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.410
 notice when you cross us 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.720
 appears here but you kind of want that 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:55.580
 that when you cross kind finally if 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.380
 that's where we do like this 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.030
 because you have to do it is that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.110
 you 're even just in front of us do not 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.450
 you're not easy because that's it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.970
 adapt you have advise and you 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.380
 can not go out so here we were 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.510
 well we make sure it does not affect 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.950
 not you I think you have to 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.569
 look in that direction for that to 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.700
 look in that direction if we become 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:29.989
 so you do state 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:34.439
 exit and your name portals toxins 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:42.379
 and now of you will open it 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:47.540
 that's how it's guay open you early 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.650
 magically that opens that look 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 I fell twice separable 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.459
 so if you fall to the side not without 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.720
 that makes you that is exciting to know 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.829
 manage it and good you to go past 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.500
 so see after where you titled so 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:13.379
 you see again and you change it 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.230
 exactly the same thing does exactly 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.540
 the same thing this time in this sense 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.500
 reverse 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.859
 if you but like that I'm leaving this not the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.069
 guide 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:36.569
 I'm not touched 2 you do something 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.180
 thing from there you go through must 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:44.430
 to cross like that it's as if they 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.650
 were so see that's so if you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.379
 want to shut down your laptop for which 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.129
 some reasons you do 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.849
 gates m a parent gate is done 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.849
 klose 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:09.370
 yes our portal and if for london to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:12.069
 you tired open sorry for the little 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.209
 I'll take part in it, you see, it can 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.489
 put any block 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:20.579
 if you break a block 7 games 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.579
 disappear according to you put the true 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.160
 yes by cons I tested game behind 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.750
 we will test after you do something 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.030
 like a kind to destroy you behind 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.650
 not a big deal 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.639
 same for the sums sent I believe 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.770
 you have to put a block 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:43.380
 behind to be safe because otherwise 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:49.470
 it'll put the portals like that 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.470
 like that there and we are not like that 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 so 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.880
 so I urge you to do that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.210
 so thanks for watching the video I 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.630

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:12.630
 plugin in the discrete the link of the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.900
