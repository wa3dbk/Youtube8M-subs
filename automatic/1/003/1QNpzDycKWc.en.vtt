00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.670
 begins the training stage in the 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.070
 Mexican national team through 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.059
 let's see the arquero guillermo ochoa 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.650
 francisco javier 'maza' defense 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.250
 rodríguez andrés saved and forward 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.040
 javier 'el chicharito' hernández 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 that is, I preferred to ask me 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.890
 when we arrived, we saw the flights and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.430
 had a vacation period I said that 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.490
 I was not interested in vacations 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.610
 and on the way back I wanted to work 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.510
 prepare me to get to 100 and good and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.540
 then nothing happens if I think so 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 I think if the fact of being there in 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.900
 a level 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.410
 Senior with international rose day by day 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.940
 with players from all over the world because 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.310
 within the top five leagues 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.770
 world is important 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.400
 you try to get the best juice out of that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.960
 no experience or good are players 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 they go in europe league champions 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.420
 league candidates to become champions of the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.660
 world and I feel good I feel 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.690
 happy because personally he has been 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.950
 very positive that development and now I 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.649
 I feel they see me in good shape 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.710
 gradually integrating people go 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.060
 that we lack there and good the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.159
 training has been there is very 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.270
 intense and us working non-stop 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.770
 to be prepared for what is coming 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.820
 that is the key as always already with the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.920
 intensity that is in the workouts 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.610
 in quality very well very well are 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.189
 hard 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.770
 we know that he was preseason and 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.329
 we are working at a hundred and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.380
 giving the extra they always have to paddle 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.509
 against the current with so little time 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.130
 to work clear that yes is what 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.810
 are doing in these in this kind of 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.369
 I work in this training me right now 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.840
 it seems finally that it was also a 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.899
 recognition for cuauhtémoc the day of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.399
 party against israel, very important that 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.259
 has been for the selection by the 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.939
 equipment that has been and especially a 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.159
 great person 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.959
 is what you have to do to us 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.849
 many of us come here what 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.060
 best last weeks we did not have 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.349
 competition and to catch pace to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.569
 also join a little bit also to the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.280
 height of the df although although we are not going to 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 play with this height but they will officiate 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.890
 for later when they go we go to 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.500
 sea ​​level so we can have more 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.420
 oxygen is a job I think very 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.819
 well done we have great coaches 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 and well everyone trying to work with 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.850
 the intensity that we are asked to for 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.300
 to be able to earn a place 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.580
 the arrival of Miguel Ponce and the theme of 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.190
 the medina that can not play with you 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.440
 a pity the truth that medina what 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.470
 I know from excel in atlas I played with 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.180
 him a few years and I have a great friendship 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 with him it was a great sadness 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.140
 for the team not the one who misses a 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.870
 world of these for these conditions 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.160
 the mind is not not nice but but 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.750
 good as I told you I wish you everything 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.300
 better than his career he continues to be 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 recover well and if God wants you can 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.350
 give a rematch in four years I wish 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 so be it 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.580
 every time you enter the field 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.370
 you play well in rhythm how are you thanks 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.660
 is this because I just think that 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.880
 I always try to be well commented what 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.140
 mentioning when between treats me 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.970
 it will be the best way with a lot 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 attitude and always helping the team or 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.520
 in this case the good selection for 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.100
 put good environments in the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.740
 trainings and others to have fun 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.260
 obviously I 've always been a little 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.940
 Joker does not always try to do it 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.350
 normally without losing respect or to 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.730
 the co - workers of the technical body do not 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.410
 but I communicate the same thing is not something 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.880
 to continue working with Miguel who 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.140
 also really like that it is not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.510
 first the environment very well 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.270
 let's be comfortable and have all the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.070
 tools to be able 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.630
 and at the end of the practice goal of 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.490
 'chilena' by oribe el brush 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.470
 peralta to the middle of the court the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.690
 arquero guillermo ochoa we're going 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.610
 international camera faces steps 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.610
