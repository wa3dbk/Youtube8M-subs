00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.880
 to which also she I am lady a 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.549
 ping and today I bring you a 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.500
 tips on how to prevent and how to fight 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.990
 this video that forms on your face 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 after having made up your makeup 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.720
 obvious that you already love you qhilla this is 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 who appears that shine on his face 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 Well the first tip that I have is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.989
 use the urban dike of the swing sell 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.840
 enough products on the market but 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.989
 this I used it, you apply it between 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.810
 our before applying makeup 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.260
 to the liquid container or powder 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.850
 and after you've done your makeup, it's good 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.830
 apply a little more on makeup 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 and that's going 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.590
 it's like a sealer the pores are not going to 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.110
 allow this fat to come out through 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.930
 pores and start your face shine good 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.930
 another product that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 it is not this ormandy environment that is the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.880
 air this are a sample that I 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.869
 they sent it and I tried it and this what it does is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.360
 It helps you keep the makeup firm 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.550
 the longer it only applies 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 after having made up 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.200
 so this is another option but 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.750
 there are also these and these pieces of paper 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.750
 are in science are the pieces of paper that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.090
 what you do is when you start your 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.190
 face to shine you think that fat 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 the only thing is appearing on the face 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.340
 what you have to do is take the paper 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 you put it on where this is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 shine that fat and the paper what's going to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 to do is to absorb that fat without ruining 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.720
 the makeup is that your makeup 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.530
 remains intact 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.570
 and the fat is absorbed by this paper 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:08.840
 but he time and I loved it and that 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.460
 they told me today at work today 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.360
 talking with friends staying from 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.220
 agreement when we go back out 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.620
 He went to talk about makeup and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.860
 shine on the face and a companion of 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.990
 work and he told us about this he gave us 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.510
 this guy so is that guy I do not 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.240
 I knew I discovered it today she did not 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.870
 she said because she and her sister come out 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.510
 too much goes to the clubs to the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.160
 antros and that's when when you're 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.220
 dancing when you're in a place where 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.130
 there are enough people you are dancing 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.890
 you start to sweat starts the pores to 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.050
 open and they all leave that that little house 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.180
 that is there and the face starts to 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.070
 shine and what he does is love 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.220
 clean every face you ruin the makeup 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.800
 Well, no 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.720
 and you make us any other product before 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.550
 to put on makeup after putting on makeup 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.170
 to fix the makeup and you do not have 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.240
 this 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.150
 you do not have this with you because this fits 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.140
 in your pocket but if you do not have this it 's 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.140
 what am I going to give you 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.110
 you go to the bathroom and in the bathrooms there are these 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.110
 things 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.360
 what are these things all for? 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:33.049
 put on the antlers of the bathroom where 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.049
 you are going to sit 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:45.260
 for that it serves but the type of paper of 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.290
 east this is exactly the same as well 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.970
 is that if you do not have this, forget it 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.160
 leaving years of touching is shining and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.460
 is sweating, go to the bathroom, take one of 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.610
 these and start to pass it on all 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.090
 the faces attending you do not have you 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.850
 suffering more he goes through to work 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.610
 you just press it and that's it 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.310
 what 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.740
 do not suffer for that brightness that comes out in the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.980
 face if you're in a club somewhere 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.530
 club are you with the rings enjoying 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.260
 go to the bathroom and take off your face 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:25.050
 good these tips I hope you serve a lot 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.330
 and I know it 's because they served me 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.610
 and right now I just checked why my 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.010
 face was sweating so can they 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.790
