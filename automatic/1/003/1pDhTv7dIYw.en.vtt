00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040

think<00:03:17.430> that's<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.730> way<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.810> might

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
think that's the way to do it that might

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.260 
think that's the way to do it that might
be<00:03:19.080> something<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.890> have<00:03:20.250> plans<00:03:20.640> for<00:03:21.030> who

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
be something that I have plans for who

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.240 
be something that I have plans for who
knows<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.170> won't<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.410> cut<00:03:22.680> away<00:03:22.830> from<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
knows but it won't be cut away from the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.830 
knows but it won't be cut away from the
runescape<00:03:23.640> content<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.420> clear<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.780> up

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
