 friends do and I bring you another 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 exciting video of dragon ball super 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.460
 the theme of this video will be who 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.130
 guys guys is a character that we do not know 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.410
 nothing is a mystery the origin of wish the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.390
 Wish race where does this come from? 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.310
 character so this video to be 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.430
 full of spoilers and information about 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.430
 of cats 19 and I'm going to touch several points 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 of those who wish because akira toriyama does not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.910
 nothing has been revealed to us in the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 freezer resurrection says to goku 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 and vegueta that he is a way of life 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.809
 with the name of wish and is all that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.820
 we know there is nothing else as you know wish 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.610
 is the master of bills the god of the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.129
 destruction if it had not been for wish 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.010
 I would not have learned the techniques 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.050
 who taught him we already know that wish him 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 he told goku and vegueta that even bis 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 I had not perfected the technique of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.989
 isolate every part of your body to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.149
 fighting with each part is a technique 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.680
 rare that I do not understand and if I was 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.570
 watching several youtubers gringos that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 they were talking about the origin of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.700
 willis your theories as I told you there's no 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.350
 information are pure speculations of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.509
 we 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.700
 but we are wondering where 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.040
 comes this character what is the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 origin because wish can be a 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.049
 much more powerful character than what 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.720
 imagine they already know that their work 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.310
 he is watching and being aware of 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.920
 what is doing well is the god of 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.049
 destruction or be civil be crazy and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.780
 start destroying planets for that 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.759
 is wish to control it and so that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.039
 get out of control there is a scene in the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.960
 battle of the gods in the end when 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.880
 elvis eats something spicy I do not know if it 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.950
 they agree and it turns red and starts to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.619
 point a bounce and destroy several 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.170
 planets then is when wish enters 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.909
 in action and the time goes back its 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.460
 Time limit is three minutes 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.470
 then he arrives and pum hits him in the middle 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.630
 neck to the bills to says the god of the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.909
 destruction and knocks it out then if it 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.950
 they fix it well it's a job of him that does not 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.200
 start destroying planets and do what 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.420
 that it pleases him the win or that is for that 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.330
 is wish and we ask another question 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.390
 guys is a god as he overcomes the power 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.489
 of bills and that student because he taught him 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.830
 all these techniques because he trained him 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.080
 I think if he is a god 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.510
 that the god of creation the god of 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.280
 life if it is the god of creation I 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.500
 I say it would make sense since it must 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.330
 have a balance in the universe in this 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.760
 case we have to bills the god of the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.710
 destruction that destroys then clear and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.810
 now he would be the god of creation is 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.940
 what I think or maybe the god of the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.400
 life and then we would have a balance 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.740
 creation and destruction there is something else 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.840
 focused 1 ep that goku tells bills 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.660
 hey you can create planets and they say no 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.210
 but I can go back the time is 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.160
 almost the same go back the time already 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.340
 that in the freezer movie 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.900
 now when freezer destroys the planet 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.480
 one hits the ground I do not know if it throws 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 a power destroys the whole earth and nothing 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.340
 more about survive goku and creel and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.160
 master roshi and the others but freezer 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.320
 kill a vegueta then we can see this 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.630
 scene where wish says to goku and 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.520
 you have one more chance and I'm going to 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.590
 go back three more time but 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.900
 You have to eliminate frizer not have 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.970
 to be playing you do not have to be 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.310
 kind to your enemy then goku him 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.500
 He says if I'm going to do then we see 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.140
 wish that raises his cane 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.760
 time goes back and the whole earth is 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.370
 is rebuilding is almost the same 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.770
 look or you are creating again the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.840
 earth I say that maybe if it's the 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.730
 god of creation because of where 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.100
 He got stability as learned 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.140
 in all dragon ball z we have seen 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.750
 characters like ma jin or others 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.510
 characters of the dragon ball use magic 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.700
 and these characters have evolved 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.920
 now they are perfecting the art of 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.870
 fight the martial arts but this 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.790
 ability to go back time never 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.340
 we had seen it in dragon ball z is 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.660
 a unique divine ability outside of 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.730
 out of this world out of this 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.350
 dimension and it would be an advantage for all 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.600
 Warriors swallowed judgments friends 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.910
 that they have to wish on their side since if 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.130
 they fight with a future enemy because nothing 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.100
 more could go back the time and it would be 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.050
 very easy and not in addition to that wish 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.060
 a staff that can see everything 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.980
 happens in the universe they remember 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.170
 also in the battle of the gods uy 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.540
 I knew where I was goku that was in the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.340
 callous planet more also he knew 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.859
 that those from beyond who choose 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.230
 vegueta and the others were in the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.480
 planet earth then he can 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.190
 and be aware of everything that happens in 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.620
 the universe is a supreme being this 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.600
 deity that is wish and if we make ourselves 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.000
 many questions how did you learn this 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.860
 ability to go back in time as 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.380
 where did he get this cane that can 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.290
 monitor the entire universe just one god 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.660
 supreme almighty has that ability 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.930
 and there is only one answer to answer 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.910
 who is wish we would be the god of 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.610
 seventh universe that is to be more 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.770
 mighty of the seventh universe overcoming 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.930
 a bills something whose beauty as I already 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.760
 I said and the other question that I am 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.860
 doing is believe that other gods of 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.360
 other universes already know that bills and 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.490
 mentioned that there were two others 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.320
 universes believe that in these two 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.180
 universes exist gods of the 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.340
 destruction and that those gods of the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.590
 destruction have someone who 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.300
 vigiles a resemblance to wish do you think 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.400
 believe that they have their same wish 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.770
 since there must be a balance in the 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.600
 universe or if it makes sense not everything 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.360
 this no friends is nothing else are my 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.670
 speculations theories about these 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.980
 guys that exist in other universes or the 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.720
 wish race or believe that nothing else in the 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.720
 seventh universe exists uy 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.150
 watching you and that maybe live 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.640
 is the weakest and who knows if these 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.340
 gods nothing else this work by itself 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.560
 alone and have no one on their side and 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.840
 as I mentioned it would be the weakest 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.910
 of all the gods and therefore not 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.610
 I do not know anything, they are nothing else 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.710
 theories as I told you imagine yourself of this 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.280
 theory if it becomes true of others 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.230
 louis existing in other universes 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.910
 imagine if the bone race I do not know 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.310
 what is it called in these supreme beings 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.140
 who watch in the universes as 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.150
 you know are two universes to what 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.800
 better they merge and form the god of 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.500
 dragon ball z 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.270
 we do not know everything can happen so nothing 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.770
 more are theories as I mentioned 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.870
 they're going to start saying you're not talking 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.120
 pure stupidities and do not know what 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.710
 they say or nothing else is for fun and if 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.110
 in the end nothing else we know that wins is 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.630
 a way of life with the name of guys 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.180
