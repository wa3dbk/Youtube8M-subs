see this can turn both ways so clockwise
and<00:01:18.869> counterclockwise<00:01:19.939> that's<00:01:20.939> normal<00:01:21.390> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and counterclockwise that's normal for

well<00:02:04.500> maybe<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> couple<00:02:05.070> you'll<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.520> fit

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
well maybe the couple you'll just fit

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.999 
well maybe the couple you'll just fit
right<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.630> actually<00:02:06.810> no<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
right on there but actually no this

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.930 
right on there but actually no this
whole<00:02:09.379> aluminum<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.979> needs<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> come<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:11.760> as

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
whole aluminum just needs to come off as

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.830 
whole aluminum just needs to come off as
well

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
well

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.420 
well
this<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.019> what<00:02:13.140> we're<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.250> hold

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
this is what we're going to do and hold

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.589 
this is what we're going to do and hold
out<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:15.769> again<00:02:17.000> thank<00:02:18.000> you

out there again thank you

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.210 
out there again thank you
hold<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.310> steady<00:02:20.959> okay<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.410> how<00:02:22.800> does<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:23.040> see

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
hold it steady okay so how does he see

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.910 
hold it steady okay so how does he see
I've<00:02:23.519> been<00:02:23.670> working<00:02:23.879> on<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.620> underneath

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I've been working on this but underneath

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.009 
I've been working on this but underneath
there's<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.120> little<00:02:27.360> shaft<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.870> it's

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
there's just a little shaft and it's

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.410 
there's just a little shaft and it's
threaded<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.980> we're<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.489> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.819> keep

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
threaded and we're just going to keep

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.900 
threaded and we're just going to keep
going<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:31.769> we<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.099> just<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
going like this see if we can just and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.240 
going like this see if we can just and
even<00:02:33.660> though<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.319> whole<00:02:34.500> shaft<00:02:34.830> moves

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
even though the whole shaft moves

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.869 
even though the whole shaft moves
clockwise<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:37.560> still<00:02:37.890> takes<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.280> impact<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
clockwise that still takes the impact of

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:45.490 
clockwise that still takes the impact of
this<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.930> actually<00:02:40.110> fully<00:02:40.860> release<00:02:43.549> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
this to actually fully release the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.640 
this to actually fully release the
coupling<00:02:47.599> keep<00:02:48.599> doing<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.319> can<00:02:49.470> see

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
coupling keep doing this you can see

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.819 
coupling keep doing this you can see
it's<00:02:49.829> totally<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:51.200> marred<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.500> mashed

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
it's totally kind of marred and mashed

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.800 
it's totally kind of marred and mashed
there<00:02:53.599> okay

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
there okay

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.110 
there okay
just<00:02:55.380> hold<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.890> place<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:59.120> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just hold it right in place just a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.640 
just hold it right in place just a
little<00:03:00.299> bit<00:03:00.420> longer<00:03:01.879> hopefully<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.030> guy

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
little bit longer hopefully this guy

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.930 
little bit longer hopefully this guy
come<00:03:04.650> right<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.340> doesn't<00:03:11.610> take

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
come right up so it really doesn't take

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.270 
come right up so it really doesn't take
a<00:03:12.180> lot<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.140> effort<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:13.980> uh<00:03:14.670> ah<00:03:15.019> there<00:03:16.019> we<00:03:16.260> go<00:03:16.440> so

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
a lot of effort but uh ah there we go so

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.059 
a lot of effort but uh ah there we go so
as<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.670> see<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:18.299> come<00:03:18.569> off<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.769> quite

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
as you can see it's come off it is quite

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.280 
as you can see it's come off it is quite
worn<00:03:20.370> down<00:03:20.639> I'm<00:03:21.389> just<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.810> check<00:03:22.109> the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
worn down I'm just going to check the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.900 
worn down I'm just going to check the
thread<00:03:22.560> here<00:03:22.920> he'll<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> looks<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.670> there's

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
thread here he'll it looks like there's

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150 
thread here he'll it looks like there's
a<00:03:23.970> little<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.680> aluminum<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:25.739> coming

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
a little bit of aluminum that's coming

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.210 
a little bit of aluminum that's coming
off<00:03:26.930> now<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:27.989> thing<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.680> want<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.980> check

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
off now the thing you do want to check

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.550 
off now the thing you do want to check
to<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.700> as<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.480> threads<00:03:30.870> are<00:03:31.079> still<00:03:31.349> good

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
to see as if the threads are still good

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.370 
to see as if the threads are still good
and<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.639> case<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.840> threads<00:03:34.139> are<00:03:34.349> going

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
and in this case the threads are going

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.610 
and in this case the threads are going
to<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.680> good<00:03:34.859> enough<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.370> actually<00:03:35.519> put<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.269> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
to be good enough to actually put on a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.330 
to be good enough to actually put on a
new<00:03:37.620> coupler<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:39.590> when<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> get<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:40.980> coupler

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
new coupler and when you get the coupler

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.870 
new coupler and when you get the coupler
in<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> mail<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:42.359> basically<00:03:42.810> going<00:03:43.169> to<00:03:43.230> be

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
in the mail it's basically going to be

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.720 
in the mail it's basically going to be
this<00:03:44.880> piece<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> teeth<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.609> going

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
this piece with the teeth and it's going

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.140 
this piece with the teeth and it's going
to<00:03:47.819> be<00:03:47.970> rolled<00:03:48.359> back<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.590> hold<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.280> maybe

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
to be rolled back and hold it to maybe

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.309 
to be rolled back and hold it to maybe
will<00:03:51.269> let<00:03:51.389> you<00:03:51.480> hold<00:03:51.660> them<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.109> want<00:03:52.169> to

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
will let you hold them so you want to

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.409 
will let you hold them so you want to
hold<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.609> got<00:03:53.609> my<00:03:53.730> three<00:03:53.940> year<00:03:54.120> old<00:03:54.150> here

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
hold it got my three year old here

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.180 
hold it got my three year old here
shouldn't<00:03:54.720> stick<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.049> on<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.349> action<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.829> just

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
shouldn't stick it on the action so just

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.839 
shouldn't stick it on the action so just
hold<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:56.489> that

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
hold it like that

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.849 
hold it like that
so<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.660> going<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.930> one<00:03:58.109> whole<00:03:58.290> piece<00:03:58.590> and

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
so it's going to be one whole piece and

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.220 
so it's going to be one whole piece and
then<00:03:59.190> once<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.549> get<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.940> you're<00:04:00.780> going<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> put

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
then once you get it you're going to put

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.110 
then once you get it you're going to put
it<00:04:01.319> on<00:04:01.500> you're<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.549> tighten<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:02.970> a

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
it on you're going to tighten it a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.830 
it on you're going to tighten it a
little<00:04:03.150> bit<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.359> you<00:04:06.359> can<00:04:06.540> further

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
little bit like this and you can further

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.830 
little bit like this and you can further
tighten<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> by<00:04:08.430> actually<00:04:09.090> plugging<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:09.720> your

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
tighten it by actually plugging in your

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.030 
tighten it by actually plugging in your
blender<00:04:10.260> moving<00:04:11.099> your<00:04:11.310> hands<00:04:11.579> away<00:04:11.819> obviously

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
blender moving your hands away obviously

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.830 
blender moving your hands away obviously
putting<00:04:14.040> your<00:04:14.310> picture<00:04:14.519> on<00:04:14.910> top<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.480> turning

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
putting your picture on top and turning

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.800 
putting your picture on top and turning
it<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.530> pull<00:04:16.769> speed<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:18.180> actually

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
it on the pull speed and that actually
