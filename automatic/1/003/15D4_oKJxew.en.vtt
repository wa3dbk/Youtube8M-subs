really great a trilogy as a whole and
you<00:00:21.960> should<00:00:22.289> definitely<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:23.160> miss<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.609> on

you should definitely not miss out on

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.599 
you should definitely not miss out on
this<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.529> previously<00:00:25.529> played<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> played

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this I previously played the played

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.660 
this I previously played the played
these<00:00:26.789> games<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.420> PC<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.369> reason<00:00:29.640> for

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
these games on PC and the reason for

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.110 
these games on PC and the reason for
that<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.119> because<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.099> original<00:00:32.219> Mass<00:00:32.820> Effect

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that is because the original Mass Effect

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.340 
that is because the original Mass Effect
never<00:00:33.360> released<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> PlayStation<00:00:34.320> 3

in a folder that you open but whatever
okay<00:01:49.040> it's<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> first<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:51.049> this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.170> funny

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
okay it's the first one this is funny

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.219 
okay it's the first one this is funny
not<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.610> sold<00:01:53.909> separately<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.810> that's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
not to be sold separately so that's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.039 
not to be sold separately so that's
pretty<00:01:55.439> funny<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.299> don't<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.360> why<00:01:57.570> they<00:01:57.810> have

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
pretty funny I don't know why they have

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.850 
pretty funny I don't know why they have
these<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.390> okay<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.680> want

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
these so I think okay they don't want

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.789 
these so I think okay they don't want
people<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> go<00:02:02.729> around<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.590> scam<00:02:04.590> other

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.750 
three gains for what is it 50 bucks or
something<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:53.549> can't

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
something like that so you can't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.190 
something like that so you can't
complain<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.150> guess<00:02:55.549> okay<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.700> was<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.200> first

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
complain I guess okay that was the first

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.589 
complain I guess okay that was the first
one<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:59.609> second<00:02:59.939> one<00:03:00.470> includes<00:03:01.939> six<00:03:02.939> plus

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
one the second one includes six plus

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.479 
one the second one includes six plus
hours<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.139> bonus<00:03:04.290> missions<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.099> that's<00:03:05.310> pretty

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
hours of bonus missions so that's pretty

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.509 
hours of bonus missions so that's pretty
great<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.780> there<00:03:06.900> are<00:03:06.959> more<00:03:07.379> DLCs<00:03:08.310> that

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
great I think there are more DLCs that

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.720 
great I think there are more DLCs that
you<00:03:08.669> can<00:03:08.879> buy<00:03:09.150> online<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.840> don't<00:03:10.579> that<00:03:11.579> are

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
