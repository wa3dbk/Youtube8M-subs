00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
into the heavens how about if you were

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.050 
into the heavens how about if you were
to<00:00:16.520> dissolve<00:00:16.940> copper<00:00:18.130> if<00:00:19.130> you<00:00:19.340> try<00:00:20.000> to

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
to dissolve copper if you try to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.460 
to dissolve copper if you try to
dissolve<00:00:20.420> it<00:00:20.600> in<00:00:20.690> water<00:00:20.720> it<00:00:21.080> should<00:00:21.260> be

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
dissolve it in water it should be

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.600 
dissolve it in water it should be
obvious<00:00:21.770> to<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:21.920> that's<00:00:22.100> not<00:00:22.250> going<00:00:22.370> to<00:00:22.430> work

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610

I<00:00:22.760> mean<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:23.030> roofs<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:23.960> Parliament

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
I mean the roofs of the Parliament

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.750 
I mean the roofs of the Parliament
Buildings<00:00:24.770> in<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:24.980> Supreme<00:00:25.280> Court<00:00:25.310> are<00:00:25.640> made

Buildings in the Supreme Court are made
out<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:26.000> copper<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:26.480> they're<00:00:26.570> not<00:00:26.720> dissolving

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
out of copper and they're not dissolving

out of copper and they're not dissolving
at<00:00:27.350> least<00:00:27.530> not<00:00:27.740> at<00:00:27.920> an<00:00:28.040> appreciable<00:00:28.400> rate<00:00:28.670> so

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
at least not at an appreciable rate so

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.640 
at least not at an appreciable rate so
you<00:00:29.510> might<00:00:29.750> have<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:29.990> do<00:00:30.200> something<00:00:30.440> a<00:00:30.620> little

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
you might have to do something a little

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.860 
you might have to do something a little
different<00:00:31.130> suppose<00:00:31.430> we<00:00:31.670> try<00:00:32.329> it<00:00:32.390> first<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
different suppose we try it first and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.029 
different suppose we try it first and
then<00:00:32.989> we'll<00:00:33.140> figure<00:00:33.200> out<00:00:33.530> what<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.770> chemistry

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
then we'll figure out what the chemistry

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.730 
then we'll figure out what the chemistry
looks<00:00:34.370> like<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:38.690> best<00:00:38.900> thing<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.230> can<00:00:39.290> think<00:00:39.530> of

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
looks like the best thing I can think of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.090 
looks like the best thing I can think of
that<00:00:40.120> is<00:00:41.120> made<00:00:41.390> out<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.600> copper<00:00:41.840> is<00:00:42.200> a<00:00:42.890> penny

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
that is made out of copper is a penny

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.080 
that is made out of copper is a penny
there<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.220> is<00:00:46.310> there<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.960> actually<00:00:49.090> let's

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
there it is there and actually let's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.400 
there it is there and actually let's
turn<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.420> over<00:00:50.510> because<00:00:50.750> I<00:00:50.930> don't<00:00:51.079> like<00:00:51.230> her

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
turn it over because I don't like her

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.690 
turn it over because I don't like her
very<00:00:51.440> much<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.070> we're<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:52.310> to<00:00:52.370> see<00:00:52.550> what

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
very much so we're going to see what

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.250 
very much so we're going to see what
happens<00:00:55.510> it's<00:00:56.510> probably<00:00:56.780> against<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.079> law<00:00:57.200> to

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
happens it's probably against the law to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.420 
happens it's probably against the law to
do<00:00:57.440> this<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.770> should<00:00:58.040> have<00:00:58.070> brought<00:00:58.280> an

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
do this I should have brought an

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
do this I should have brought an
American<00:00:58.850> penny<00:01:03.219> it's<00:01:04.219> a<00:01:04.369> li<00:01:04.489> ho<00:01:04.729> Elizabeth

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
American penny it's a li ho Elizabeth

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.700 
American penny it's a li ho Elizabeth

right away something's happening you can

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.740 
right away something's happening you can
see<00:01:12.120> some<00:01:12.420> bubbles<00:01:12.570> coming<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.230> this<00:01:17.750> long

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
see some bubbles coming out of this long

you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> few<00:01:22.890> things<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.160> don't<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.340> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you can see a few things I don't know if

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.590 
you can see a few things I don't know if
you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.550> see<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> color<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.270> there's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> lot

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you can see the color but there's a lot

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.150 
you can see the color but there's a lot
of<00:01:24.630> greenish<00:01:25.050> coloration<00:01:25.680> coming<00:01:26.010> off<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
of greenish coloration coming off of

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.250 
of greenish coloration coming off of
this<00:01:26.370> and<00:01:26.550> that's<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> copper<00:01:27.150> ion<00:01:27.450> going

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
this and that's the copper ion going

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.930 
this and that's the copper ion going
into<00:01:28.470> solution<00:01:28.950> whenever<00:01:29.550> you<00:01:29.729> see<00:01:29.910> a

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
into solution whenever you see a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.180 
into solution whenever you see a
Bluegreen<00:01:30.540> sort<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> aqua<00:01:31.320> color<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> solution

Bluegreen sort of aqua color in solution

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.969 
Bluegreen sort of aqua color in solution
they're<00:01:32.310> probably<00:01:32.550> copper<00:01:33.000> ions<00:01:33.300> in<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they're probably copper ions in it the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.170 
they're probably copper ions in it the
other<00:01:35.100> thing<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.370> can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> bubbles

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
other thing you can see are the bubbles

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.180 
other thing you can see are the bubbles
coming<00:01:36.510> out<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:37.229> you've<00:01:37.410> got<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> explain<00:01:37.950> that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
coming out so you've got to explain that

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.760 
coming out so you've got to explain that
as<00:01:38.370> well<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.050> this<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.259> redox<00:01:40.590> reaction

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
as well and this is a redox reaction

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.580 
as well and this is a redox reaction
whenever<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.520> metal<00:01:42.270> dissolves<00:01:43.050> in<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> liquid

whenever a metal dissolves in a liquid

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.650 
whenever a metal dissolves in a liquid
there<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.250> undoubtedly<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:45.119> redox<00:01:45.509> reaction

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
there is undoubtedly a redox reaction

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.480 
there is undoubtedly a redox reaction
going<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.440> because<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.950> metal<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.340> being

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
going on because the metal is being

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
going on because the metal is being
oxidized<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.300> going<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:48.690> pure<00:01:48.960> metal

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
oxidized it's going from pure metal

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
on how come the copper is dissolving and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
on how come the copper is dissolving and
what's<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.160> brown<00:02:12.120> gas<00:02:12.390> coming<00:02:12.810> off<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> top

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
what's that brown gas coming off the top

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.530 
what's that brown gas coming off the top
well<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.430> explain<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.090> terms<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
well you have to explain it in terms of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.090 
well you have to explain it in terms of
something<00:02:15.720> being<00:02:15.989> oxidized<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.769> something

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
something being oxidized and something

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.800 
something being oxidized and something
being<00:02:17.220> reduced<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.360> you've<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.660> split

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
being reduced so you've got to split

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
being reduced so you've got to split
this<00:02:19.049> reaction<00:02:19.560> into<00:02:19.769> two<00:02:19.950> so-called<00:02:20.280> half

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
this reaction into two so-called half

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.120 
this reaction into two so-called half
reactions<00:02:21.299> one<00:02:21.780> showing<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.350> oxidation<00:02:22.830> with

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
reactions one showing the oxidation with

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.220 
reactions one showing the oxidation with
the<00:02:23.220> release<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.610> electrons<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.200> other

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the release of electrons and the other

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.039 
the release of electrons and the other
showing<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.769> reduction<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.660> which<00:02:27.660> will<00:02:27.840> take

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
showing a reduction with which will take

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.680 
showing a reduction with which will take
in<00:02:28.200> those<00:02:28.350> electrons<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.040> reduce<00:02:29.370> something

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
in those electrons and reduce something

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
in those electrons and reduce something
so<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.900> copper<00:02:31.200> gets<00:02:31.230> oxidized<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.100> one's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so the copper gets oxidized this one's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.710 
so the copper gets oxidized this one's
easy<00:02:32.610> because<00:02:33.560> we<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:35.150> blue<00:02:36.150> ions<00:02:36.510> in

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
easy because we know that blue ions in

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.430 
easy because we know that blue ions in
solution<00:02:36.750> mean<00:02:37.610> copper<00:02:38.610> plus<00:02:38.880> two<00:02:38.910> ions<00:02:39.480> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
solution mean copper plus two ions so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.009 
solution mean copper plus two ions so
copper<00:02:41.190> goes<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.549> CU<00:02:41.820> plus<00:02:42.060> two<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.570> you've

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
copper goes to CU plus two and you've

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.390 
copper goes to CU plus two and you've
got<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> balance<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.709> thing<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.190> there's<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
got to balance this thing so there's a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.720 
got to balance this thing so there's a
couple<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.700> electrons<00:02:45.150> being<00:02:45.420> released<00:02:45.720> this

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
couple of electrons being released this

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.699 
couple of electrons being released this
is<00:02:47.730> why<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.850> say<00:02:48.150> dissolution<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.110> metals<00:02:49.470> like

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
is why I say dissolution of metals like

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.070 
is why I say dissolution of metals like
rusting<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.700> your<00:02:50.850> car<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.390> instance<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.900> is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
rusting of your car for instance this is

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.410 
rusting of your car for instance this is
also<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.440> redox<00:02:52.890> process<00:02:53.400> where<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.120> metal

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
also a redox process where the metal

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.000 
also a redox process where the metal
becomes<00:02:54.780> metal<00:02:55.200> ions<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.739> then<00:02:55.830> obviously

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
becomes metal ions and then obviously

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.680 
becomes metal ions and then obviously
it's<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.580> much<00:02:56.790> used<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.269> it's<00:02:57.420> not<00:02:57.510> going

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
it's not much used to you it's not going

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
it's not much used to you it's not going
to<00:02:57.750> hold<00:02:57.840> your<00:02:58.049> car<00:02:58.170> together<00:02:58.320> anymore<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
to hold your car together anymore the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.670 
to hold your car together anymore the
only<00:03:00.030> thing<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.600> there<00:03:00.780> which<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.170> easily

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
only thing in there which is easily

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.630 
only thing in there which is easily
reducible<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:03.060> nitrate<00:03:03.480> ion<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
reducible is the nitrate ion and the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.870 
reducible is the nitrate ion and the
nitrate<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.209> part<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.100> nitric<00:03:08.100> acid<00:03:08.519> again

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
nitrate is part of the nitric acid again

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.130 
nitrate is part of the nitric acid again
you<00:03:09.269> are<00:03:09.360> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> have<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.810> come<00:03:09.959> to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
you are going to have to come to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720 
you are going to have to come to
recognize<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.190> being<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.459> soluble

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
recognize this as being a soluble

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.509 
recognize this as being a soluble
compound<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.690> hno3<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.650> actually<00:03:14.010> hydrogen

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
compound so hno3 is is actually hydrogen

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.180 
compound so hno3 is is actually hydrogen
ions<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.090> nitrate<00:03:15.209> ions<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.470> nitrate<00:03:16.860> ions

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
ions and nitrate ions the nitrate ions

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.040 
ions and nitrate ions the nitrate ions
plus<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.640> hydrogen<00:03:17.790> ions<00:03:18.330> pick<00:03:18.599> up<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> two

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
plus the hydrogen ions pick up the two

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.050 
plus the hydrogen ions pick up the two
electrons<00:03:19.530> from<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
electrons from the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.210 
electrons from the
sedation<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.690> become<00:03:21.380> into<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> four<00:03:22.040> plus

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
sedation and become into a four plus

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.130 
sedation and become into a four plus
water<00:03:22.550> so<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.420> nitrate<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.959> gets

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
water so it's the nitrate that gets

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.360 
water so it's the nitrate that gets
reduced<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.739> it<00:03:24.890> becomes

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
reduced and it becomes

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.490 
reduced and it becomes
dinitrogen<00:03:25.940> tetroxide<00:03:26.450> which<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.319> also

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
dinitrogen tetroxide which is also

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.000 
dinitrogen tetroxide which is also
present<00:03:28.099> has<00:03:28.340> 2<00:03:28.940> no2<00:03:29.239> s<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.680> which

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
present has 2 no2 s and it's that which

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.199 
present has 2 no2 s and it's that which
is<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.400> void<00:03:31.819> seems<00:03:32.180> really<00:03:32.420> going<00:03:32.599> now<00:03:32.750> I

can't<00:03:40.340> even<00:03:40.489> see<00:03:40.670> it's<00:03:40.790> moving<00:03:41.150> around<00:03:41.390> it's

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
can't even see it's moving around it's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.720 
can't even see it's moving around it's
so<00:03:42.500> active<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:46.040> penny<00:03:46.280> will<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.550> gone

so active so that penny will be gone

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.110 
so active so that penny will be gone
momentarily<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.900> would<00:03:48.140> say<00:03:48.290> it's<00:03:48.440> probably

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
momentarily I would say it's probably

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.240 
momentarily I would say it's probably
that's<00:03:50.120> getting<00:03:50.510> pretty<00:03:50.599> thin<00:03:50.930> let's<00:03:51.920> say<00:03:52.100> she

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
that's getting pretty thin let's say she

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.500 
that's getting pretty thin let's say she
never<00:03:52.459> looked<00:03:52.670> better<00:03:52.790> actually

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.199 

I'm<00:03:56.510> not<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> monarchist<00:03:57.290> as<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.650> can<00:03:57.830> see<00:03:58.209> so

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
I'm not a monarchist as you can see so

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.509 
I'm not a monarchist as you can see so
the<00:03:59.480> nitrate<00:04:00.170> gets<00:04:00.380> reduced<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.830> an<00:04:00.890> 204<00:04:01.370> and

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
the nitrate gets reduced to an 204 and

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.100 
the nitrate gets reduced to an 204 and
as<00:04:01.640> we'll<00:04:01.880> see<00:04:02.090> next<00:04:02.269> time<00:04:02.569> there's<00:04:02.810> an<00:04:02.959> easy

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
as we'll see next time there's an easy

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.670 
as we'll see next time there's an easy
way<00:04:03.230> of<00:04:03.350> balancing<00:04:03.980> these<00:04:04.100> reactions
