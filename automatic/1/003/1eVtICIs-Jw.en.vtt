the<00:02:12.870> top<00:02:13.170> things<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.740> know<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> mean<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.130> have

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the top things you know I mean I have

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.370 
the top things you know I mean I have
some<00:02:14.430> things<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.660> might<00:02:15.870> career<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
that I put up there would probably be

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.090 
that I put up there would probably be
nominated<00:02:19.110> for<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> Grammy<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.739> going<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.040> the

Grammys and and the dime bag things that
I've<00:02:24.300> done<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:27.030> there's<00:02:27.270> some

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
I've done and but like there's some

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.860 
I've done and but like there's some
stuff<00:02:27.570> left<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.020> top

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.320 

it<00:02:33.500> was<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> great<00:02:34.040> vibe<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.849> completely

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it was a great vibe and it completely

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.410 
it was a great vibe and it completely
clashed<00:02:35.959> with<00:02:36.500> what<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.640> thought<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.150> was<00:02:38.239> going

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
clashed with what I thought it was going

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.020 
clashed with what I thought it was going
to<00:02:38.569> do<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> time<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.860> didn't<00:02:43.819> agree

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to do at the time like I didn't agree

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.350 
to do at the time like I didn't agree
with<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.680> whole<00:02:45.950> concept<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.030> begin

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
with the whole concept of it to begin

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.059 
with the whole concept of it to begin
with<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:47.780> thought<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.050> was<00:02:48.140> self<00:02:48.379> aggrandizing

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
with I thought it was self aggrandizing

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.789 
with I thought it was self aggrandizing
and<00:02:49.700> just<00:02:50.569> kind<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.110> little<00:02:51.410> pretentious

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799
