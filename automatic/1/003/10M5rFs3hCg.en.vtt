00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.060
 I will explain the putter today. 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.020
 There are people who put and beat variously. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 The person who only strikes with the wrist, 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.900
 Person who fixed wrist and hit with shoulder, 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.900
 In addition, the person who holds the opposite way, 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.660
 A person holding hands 

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:33.256
 There are various ways of hitting. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.080
 For the first time to putter today, I will explain the easy way of hitting 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.360
 First, the address. It is a putter's stance. 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.500
 It is in the forward leaning posture as usual, 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 Open your feet. 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.120
 The first time you hit a putter 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.900
 Try not to use your wrist as much as possible. 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.420
 Keep the triangle without using the wrist, 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.840
 I strike with a pendulum. 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 The position of the ball is just below your left eye. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.820
 The position of the ball will be slightly to the left of the middle when the legs are open about the shoulder width. 

00:01:50.374 --> 00:01:52.374
 Straighten the face, 

00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:56.535
 Shake while keeping the arm triangle. 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.380
 Let's keep your head from moving to the left and right. 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.180
 Move your shoulders firmly and hit a triangle. 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.960
 Well, I will try to hit one ball. Look at my head after hitting. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.520
 After hitting the head, I will leave it without watching the ball. 

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.345
 It strikes like this. 

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:54.235
 Next time is my swing. 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.580
 The basics are shaken symmetrically. 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.640
 When the distance is long, I raise it a lot. 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.660
 When the distance is short, raise it small. 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.700
 I will explain the practice method easily from now. 

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.553
 Prepare a little ball. 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.380
 Determine your goals 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 Straight there 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.040
 It is called a touch, but it is an exercise to hit with the strength to stop as close as possible. 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.580
 Without breaking the triangle 

00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:15.855
 I will hit it with my swing. 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.300
 I will practice to stop in this way. 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.120
 The golf course is green 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.560
 The speed and speed change depending on the golf course. 

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:33.155
 It is good to practice putting before the start. 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.320
 At first it is more than practice to put close distance with putter 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.080
 Practice to get close to the cup at a distance will lead to score up. 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440
 Please try it for everyone.
