00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.240
 political parties and the country in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.889

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.349

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.030
 filthy corruption of the pri and also you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 dragonball z the rebirth of freezer hello 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.840
 welcome to nopal times soy soul 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 single and today we present you the first 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.070
 chapter of the program in nopal times 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070
 if we answer you, we initiate 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.060
 you think there's something politically invested in 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.450
 mexico that can change the country to 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.490
 all right 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 louis veto is not viable in the short term 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.420
 Well, the hope of a better country is not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 only a task of the parties or of the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 government but mainly is a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.880
 activity that corresponds to the people 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 the best thing is to have a village 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.809
 participatory informed and aware that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 compare the proposals of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.879
 candidates and the trajectory of each one 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 whether they are of a party or independent 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 entrust to one party the salvation 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.420
 and the hope of a country is like giving it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 a blank check in an unknown 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 where abuses can be committed and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 end up as a ruined country and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 shattered more shattered than the back 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 of my brother when in my poor neighborhood 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.740
 we wanted to improvise an elevator 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.740
 automatic 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.350
 next what do you think of dragon ball z the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.659
 reborn from freezer winehouse after being 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.659
 so addicted to dragon movies 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.720
 ball the best scene is when freezer 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.820
 force damn and killed his soldier and tied 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.310
 rubber even though they had just 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.439
 resurrect 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.720
 the other day of that movie is that no 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.289
 evil has triumphed as if it happens in 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.299
 Mexico, what do you hesitate to see as the pri if 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.090
 won the majority of the congress in 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:50.270
 past elections mexico is going to rot 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.340
 of stupid people ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.560
 because almost nobody mentions gerardo 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 fernandez noroña what do you think of him and 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.490
 how media like television have 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 censored televisa and tvazteca have 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.810
 censored to Fernández Noroña for being a 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 hard critic of the television stations for 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.710
 try many of its convincing 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.599
 speeches and a long career in 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.519
 where he has excelled in some things but 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.739
 has also been subject to reasonable 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.730
 critical and controversial but making a 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.920
 balance in general 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.170
 Fernández Noroña has been a person who 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.060
 has contributed to the confrontation has evidenced 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.860
 acts of corruption and has promoted 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.900
 various social causes 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.760
 enrique peña grandson is absolutely 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.650
 committed to transparency at 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.989
 one hundred percent is corrupt mind 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.630
 transparent the corruption that he in 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.819
 meats monsters the gray house and rigor of 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.180
 150 and 100 million pesos is a 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.340
 brutal example is an insult to the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.200
 population that neither housing has and in addition 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.670
 it is a major insult that has not been 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 sued his wife to tell us that 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.910
 doing soap operas but only 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.190
 televisa could buy a house of 100 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.530
 million pesos and where the idea was born 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.299
 of forming this channel he does not carry himself 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.730
 me with the idea of four friends fernando 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.870
 to napa or rafa and saul to offer a 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.299
 report alternative 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.349
 analysis and criticism where 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.330
 let's do a retelling of 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.190
 main news of the week that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.890
 are usually restricted by 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.750
 television another objective is 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.940
 offer diversity of arguments for 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.099
 that people are more informed and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.900
 are more critical we also want to put 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.209
 our little bit of evidence 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.129
 the dirty acts of corruption like the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.590
 administration of the pri with peña grandson- 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.480
 where it has had a terrible fall the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.730
 security the economy and education 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.500
 but actually that of my compadre 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.340
 of the crocodile when he wanted to show us 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.340
 I was superman 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.840
 next question what will happen with 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.340
 mexico in 20 years considering that the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.730
 government follow the same as now 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.549
 I do not think I 'm stupid I'm not going to 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.459
 reveal you free the future of mexico and 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.439
 port services in millions the last 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.760
 time they wanted my predictions the 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.129
 Green Government did not offer 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.340
 federal shares of your state 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.519
 I offer well as attribute anahí 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.829
 obviously the garbage does not 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.629
 interested with Pablo on the assumption that 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.090
 the PRI government will continue in the 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.250
 power with their abuses for 20 years plus the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.680
 people would not tolerate it would start a 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.720
 revolution or a civil war without 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.849
 However, in at least one half of the country 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.099
 the people are not revealing the face 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 so easy as people are informed 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.150
 more videotape and denounce the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.130
 corruption of politicians and people 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.650
 arrogant as in the case of many 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.240
 ladies and gentlemen abusive if not 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.370
 we speak a participatory people and 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.560
 conscious the electoral frauds and the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.630
 Corruptions will be more difficult than us 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.550
 apply them our meter is that better 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.169
 in political parties or what 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.129
 opposite is found in a severe 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.319
 drop 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.039
 fall that of my friend with complex 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.039
 gymnast 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.660
 Do you think Donald Trump is a good 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.570
 president of mexico there is alburero de 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.900
 suck family came out more donkey than rock 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.510
 grandson and the self that studies this 2nd of 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.000
 primary that with this memory they wanted 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.680
 to swallow the worms that in the article 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.960
 33 of the constitution 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.090
 clarito says that there is no den of light 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.850
 foreigners can walk of metiches 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.280
 meddlesome after Mexican politics 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.500
 new question how about saul do you think that 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.540
 for the elections of 2018 it reaches 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.310
 have independent candidates if 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.440
 surely we will see at least one or 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.110
 several independent candidates in the 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.570
 2018 we must be careful in evaluating 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.360
 Very well the proposed profile and history 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.250
 each party candidate or not because 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.710
 it is very likely that the pri 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.960
 PRIistas disguised as independents to 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.580
 more than some position although he has never 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.610
 said he will not seek the presidency in 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.290
 2018 some analysts and media if what 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.570
 they point as possible candidate 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.030
