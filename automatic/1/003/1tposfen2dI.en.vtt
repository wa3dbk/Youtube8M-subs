Assassin's<00:00:16.830> Creed<00:00:16.980> has<00:00:17.010> been<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> env3<00:00:18.330> since

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since
the<00:00:18.900> beginning<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.890> how<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> develop

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the beginning so we know how to develop

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.670 
the beginning so we know how to develop
for<00:00:20.970> ps3<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.930> now<00:00:22.080> we're<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.410> enjoying

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.800 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying
developing<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.430> ps4<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.359> thing<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.750> is

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
developing for ps4 first thing that is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.120 
developing for ps4 first thing that is
going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.019> change<00:00:25.199> drastically<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
going to change drastically as the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
going to change drastically as the
graphics<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.750> visually

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
graphics because we think that visually

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.710 
graphics because we think that visually
with<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> stronger<00:00:29.340> GPUs<00:00:29.789> drown<00:00:30.060> your<00:00:30.179> CPU<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
with the stronger GPUs drown your CPU a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.389 
with the stronger GPUs drown your CPU a
lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.170> RAM<00:00:31.380> we're<00:00:31.740> gonna<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:32.040> able<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
lot of RAM we're gonna be able to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.400 
lot of RAM we're gonna be able to
exploit<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.000> lot<00:00:33.270> discounsel<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.050> push<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
exploit a lot discounsel and push the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.290 
exploit a lot discounsel and push the
bar<00:00:34.620> visual<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> lot<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.030> Twitter

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
bar visual it's a lot more in Twitter

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090 
bar visual it's a lot more in Twitter
for<00:00:36.630> engineers<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.469> lot<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.829> like

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
for engineers it's a lot more like

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.280 
for engineers it's a lot more like
compute<00:00:38.760> shaders<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.420> add<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> put<00:00:40.110> them

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
compute shaders that we add and put them

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.250 
compute shaders that we add and put them
on<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> ps4<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.480> new<00:00:42.809> texts<00:00:43.140> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
on the ps4 and all these new texts that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529 
on the ps4 and all these new texts that
we're<00:00:43.350> pushing<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:44.040> natively<00:00:44.910> fitting<00:00:45.390> in

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
we're pushing are natively fitting in

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.190 
we're pushing are natively fitting in
the<00:00:45.629> ps4<00:00:46.579> all<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:48.180> details<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the ps4 all little details that you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
the ps4 all little details that you
cannot<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> current

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
cannot right now put on the current

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.970 
cannot right now put on the current
generation<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.690> consoles<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
generation of consoles because the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
generation of consoles because the
council<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.460> being<00:00:53.670> fully<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.600> running

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
council is being fully like it's running

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
council is being fully like it's running
a<00:00:54.899> hundred<00:00:55.199> percent<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a hundred percent right now so you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
a hundred percent right now so you
cannot<00:00:57.030> add<00:00:57.270> all<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:58.079> details<00:00:58.230> that

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
cannot add all these little details that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.750 
cannot add all these little details that
are<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> make<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> game<00:00:59.430> even<00:00:59.609> more

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
are going to make the game even more

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.110 
are going to make the game even more
beautiful<00:01:00.090> more<00:01:00.539> immersive<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.859> overall<00:01:02.370> ps4

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
beautiful more immersive the overall ps4

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
beautiful more immersive the overall ps4
experience<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.379> look<00:01:04.409> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
experience that make the game look so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250 
experience that make the game look so
much<00:01:05.010> better<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.549> ps4<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:07.020> definitely

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
much better on ps4 I think definitely

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.109 
much better on ps4 I think definitely
the<00:01:07.740> share<00:01:07.979> button<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.460> something<00:01:08.850> really

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

the share button is something really
really<00:01:09.240> cool<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> will<00:01:10.909> love<00:01:11.909> us

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really cool because now it will love us

the companion gaming so it's going to be

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
the companion gaming so it's going to be
a<00:01:28.619> nice<00:01:28.860> evolution<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.759> terms<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.720> gaming

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a nice evolution in terms of the gaming

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
a nice evolution in terms of the gaming
world<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.770> assassins<00:01:32.189> creed<00:01:32.340> 4<00:01:32.400> black<00:01:32.579> flag

world the assassins creed 4 black flag
will<00:01:33.420> merge<00:01:33.840> round<00:01:34.560> gameplay<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.549> naval

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
will merge round gameplay and naval

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.350 
will merge round gameplay and naval
gameplay<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.100> able<00:01:38.360> totally

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
seamless boarding so right now you're

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
seamless boarding so right now you're
going<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> sea<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:51.329> seeing<00:01:51.750> another

going in the sea you're seeing another

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.410 
going in the sea you're seeing another
ship<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.770> attack<00:01:53.130> him<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.490> once<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.119> weaken

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
ship you attack him and once you weaken

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.179
