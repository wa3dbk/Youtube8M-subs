00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.720
 good people hello everyone 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.210
 here we are with which we are going to move 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.430
 and it is not yet determined why 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.660
 let's do to try 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 what step by step I'm doing a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.510
 couple of things 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.230
 let's go chatting 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.230
 in a return 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.350
 as they see using the noise 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.579
 prepared ported wonder the truth 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.579
 It's very cute 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.150
 let's try a little the subject of the in 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.390
 the sky was of the tool is something 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.390
 indispensable 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.300
 as they see is to cut with a show 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.829
 It has helped me a lot 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.809
 very much things 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.839
 what we're going to see also on the subject of 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.059
 the position of the tool like him 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.059
 is right the heat knead s 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 and on the subject of machines 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 s 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.550
 the position of the tool in this 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 case that is to leave a kneading stick 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.820
 straight right hear them right that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.780
 they give us impressions because in reality 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.930
 those programs are more right possible 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.770
 so let's move on to that part 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 as you see the agendas I have reviewed 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.250
 they also reviewed with a chisel 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.570
 then with that gouge what you are seeing 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.100
 it's a common clamp to 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.420
 see if you can appreciate the quality of the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.210
 video is not very good because we do it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.960
 with a cell phone but that's it or if 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.409
 we can take a little closer 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.979
 or with a little more here 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:09.189
 we have to tighten the hoses of the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.189
 rubber cars cars 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.310
 our focus is to offer a house 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.770
 auto spare car store 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.770
 accountants takes us to screw x 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.920
 now the raft of the vein that flight almost 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.620
 you press a little bit with the times 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.010
 they put in shape a gouge that has a 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.469
 turn at a 90 degree angle has 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.469
 Be careful not to cut yourself when you put the 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:39.990
 clamp after it is supported the 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:42.990
 clamp and our tight medium 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.470
 and it works as well as the inclined media 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.110
 the form a of course 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.510
 and you always have to keep in mind that 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.660
 work at 90 degrees 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.400
 in the rule in the rule is the pose 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.210
 I would have called it rule in this case 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.210
 it seems a rule 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.300
 Noel 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.510
 there he is always working at 90 degrees 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.330
 move the tool at 90 degrees 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.410
 comparing it with the rule and it goes 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.500
 attracting slowly 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.330
 as it has been said regular in view of 5 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.080
 does not want 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.580
 as long as I always say I tell the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.360
 people as close to the club as possible 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.450
 support has to be as close to the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.270
 wood to be able to have a better 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.700
 driving 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.510
 avoid hooking more than anything with a 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.430
 hook tool 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.230
 a gimlet more than anything for the subject of 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.090
 that a pointy but for this is 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.540
 spectacular we are testing the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.690
 Pasadita always at an angle 90 degrees 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.210
 pass the tool so that this is 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.490
 smooth 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.360
 Not only did but a rector in 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.360
 a straight line once 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.220
 the very difficult is very simple 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.080
 well how are you looking perfect 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.740
 now let's do another little step more 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.740
 let's regulate 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.939
 and there we go 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.299
 to get a little more, believe how it goes 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.549
 taking out perfect 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.349
 the inclination must be taken into account 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.889
 of the tool being sharp 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.889
 to the budget 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.000
 the truth that they are very good and another 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.270
 thing to consider in supporting 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.270
 gouge 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.320
 in the rule that I tell you 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.410
 in that iron he has that iron has 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.710
 than having the two tips measured 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.200
 exactly between the central points 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.139
 to see so much of the lathe of the colon 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.800
 downtown that has the car I tell you that 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.800
 comes 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.479
 and the front part that has the other 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.610
 centered tip now have to have the 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.770
 tip of the rule or as close 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.979
 possible to have this 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.650
 a better tuning on the bread and so 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:12.690
 as you see if it is happening and it is being 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.690
 barbo the truth that is wonderful 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.820
 let's see how it was right on the ground 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.070
 he gave me a plastic rule that I have 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.640
 there they grabbed me the rule but it serves me 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.640
 to do this job 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.040
 the truth is not perfect 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.960
 has no problem no damage 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.650
 knows how to be a magazine but you have to 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.650
 keep in mind 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.600
 that the main thing in this is to leave it 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.670
 more lawful 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.100
 so that it is ready when there is some 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.970
 revardit well some nerve some 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.150
 chiquitita scratch that's no problem 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.150
 why 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.179
 I actually grabbed a sandpaper a taco 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:59.369
 very large heel but good is used 

00:05:54.179 --> 00:06:02.330
 recipe with one smaller than this one and what 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:02.330
 we put to work there 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.500
 is going on I start with a sandpaper 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.970
 100 depending on the wood but mostly it 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.940
 starts with analysis and from there to 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.849
 up until you reach 600 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.800
 yes 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:21.259
 according to ironing 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.629
 and the truth is that there is a wonder 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.810
 wonder now in this process we are going to 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.940
 watch 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.290
 how do you cut this tool that already 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.940
 we had made in the previous video 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.910
 the rain of caggiano half cane 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.980
 cut the truth the edge he is what 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.570
 I wanted to explain it because sometimes I 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.760
 I forget of course doing half for 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.050
 there he is not looking at what he does here 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.670
 editing it but this the hard edge 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.530
 very much to according to the use of the 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.700
 tool as they come it cuts very very 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.780
 pretty I'll see if I can zoom in 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.790
 image now we are seeing 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.790
 you can see the long shavings 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.240
 there you can see I'm working with one hand 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.759
 alone and giving priority to the telephone 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.840
 another hand so a little bit like but 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.840
 in the veritÃ  

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.530
 on the other hand
