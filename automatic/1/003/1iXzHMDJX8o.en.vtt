00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.610
 this is the last quarter of a place 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.800
 and the blue dreams of the Japanese 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.040
 because I came Ukrainian shoot with 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.299
 accounting oxy sell 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.099

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.300
 ballet 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.439
 many more interesting things in this car 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 it seemed well here for example fucking building 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 she for some reason fuckin lives separately hun 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.470
 this time of development 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.200
 I understand that once underdeveloped completely 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.450
 also need to relax 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.660
 really liked better 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.910
 what pills coal them in children 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 about 1000 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.030
 maybe my hands are small 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.780
 but somehow fucking awkward in the photo on 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.630
 full of palm face 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.030
 Julio Pay 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.300
 interesting much openings 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.780
 doors shoulders feet 200 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.370
 and it was just a puck star 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.720
 then you have to change it back 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.950
 pastor and where to fall 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.760
 Well, unless of course from the car private 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.050
 the helicopter may not less 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.030
 so I went to shit on walk 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300
 notary receipts chased out 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 that it would not understand me from the gulf 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350
 but of course individual praise 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 deserves 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.260
 torpedo 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.570
 and dashboard which ships 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 Apulia was a book the fucking light bulb 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320
 unfastened belt 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.350
 you can probably guess that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.060
 if I don't want to wear my belt for three hours 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 that is, this light bulb is even fucking 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.640
 Here I have a leg of work themselves not fastened 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 floating stream 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.280
 negative thoughts are observed 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.400
 very pleased with the location of the key 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.270
 start motor lightened two there 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.150
 in the course know by whom 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.159
 and to get there 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.760
 and on the other 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.540
 I don't know how to learn 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.030
 to get there the first time why 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.610
 there will be a place for smokers to do 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.870
 no other place 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.159
 Doctors asshole issued and here it would be easier 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.009
 cruise control constantly on the knee 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.340
 me the way 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.250
 but probably itâ€™s good that 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190
 he immediately includes nothing apparently just 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.249
 here how will the rubles go 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.819
 very pleased with the signal 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.150
 The percentage of those who first clicked 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.909
 there is 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.209
 I thought that I could take you to the community though 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.269
 to be happened and also because 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.739
 of course 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.680
 a feeling that he will be right to me salon 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.439
 fuck 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.339
 I do not know where there is noise insulation in this 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.390
 car but ultimately to the salon specific 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.149
 business 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.489
 loud name 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.070
 pleased overclocking dynamics it is 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.600
 true motor 2 and 4 but the dynamics of strange 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.469
 there is 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.699
 but when you push the fucking gas pedal 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.839
 it feels like somebody fart in 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.329
 empty barrel box is such a customized 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.679
 exhaust sound 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.279
 on this car 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.349
 probably a tour 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.810
 the Japanese were very surprised probably 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.319
 this place to walk 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.919
 they saved 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.409
 20 grams of thermal insulation 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.420
 why is it here these days 30 meters 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.399
 here is the result 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.829
 but after a short 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 electoral commission minutes 25 30 apparently something they 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.349
 bent with glitter structure 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.819
 this is not clear lever sticks out such 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.089
 fuck 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.309
 in the picture it is disturbing of course but probably 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.669
 so again it should be 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.869
 everything is quiet 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.739
 this process is underway 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.700
 then of course went faster than a movie like 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.049
 quickly 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.180
 here here is fucking so we are not so 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.799
 just court 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.159
 I took a couple of times fucking thought I would break 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.979
 the box 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.149
 but sort of like she adapted visits 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:40.919
 our drivers 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.189
 krivoruky therefore ok then 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.699
 broke 6 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.709
 very pleased with these arm warming 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 temperature settings 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.209
 music into the economy I am not conveniently located 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.849
 in that it attracted to reach out to her already 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.289
 on the outstretched hand shine hand get 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.659
 And if you fucking and and at least use more often 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.119
 what is climate climate husband kinda like 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.159
 fucking shot 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.549
 I would like them 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.489
 still as nonsense to adjust 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.939
 alcohol okay 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.339
 taste of health 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.069
 along with the fact that without any further ask 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.969
 than for such a period after the installation of supports 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.699
 ticket in the message 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.520
 grouping and feel fucking 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.039
 how much did you add is unrealistic 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.680
 look at the screen 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.199
 during the gran good 25 degrees fucking she 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.199
 spinning to consume not so long ago which 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.439
 in plans a case 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.469
 cool car let's hope that 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.710
 we will take off asus the account we will sell 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.630
 In the summer of protest, we read Lithuanian 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.669
 say goodbye 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.689
 and still liked to endure this time 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:46.500
 did not make out 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.250
 First of all, the seat does not resemble 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.260
 just how I live
