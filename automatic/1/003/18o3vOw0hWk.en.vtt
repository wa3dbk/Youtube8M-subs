00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.589
 we take the whole track and in the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:13.349
 length you take me a transition 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:16.680
 too much stop and I do not want to find and a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.510
 meal or not even edwards was fine 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.510
 so it's the same on the other side 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:32.590
 these cameras it is not bad I think 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.550
 that gc cameras all 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:43.379
 simplicity and leaves by remaining stable 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 in your poor to the lure of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.190
 changes to next diagonal and one 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.329
 going to do a thing to right hand to hand 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.399
 right as we did on the left 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.339
 transition on a transition side of 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.210
 the other one so hires you go them 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.710
 shoulders watts keeping the same speed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.299
 it's molly finger without theater 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.369
 anticipated that it was necessary to leave 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.030
 calais or not to not let her 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.030
 slow down 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.710
 this is stable and transition from this 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:28.700
 side there where you want and we 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.140
 go back very well how much bonal and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 we do the same on the other side in the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.080
 same attitude well stable casual 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.080
 so well in order when I slow down 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:57.750
 and we leave world to bonal 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.210
 big deer on this side there small pressure 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.220
 in legs to advance a little bit without 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.540
 let her put on the nose Auxerre 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.680
 a little bit your fingers between dresser 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.240
 to put it back a little bit 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 nose or was she trotting dance 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.820
 putting on the shoulders that's how 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.860
 the challenge is a little faster 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.430
 but a little bit of people to have a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.860
 little more tonicity 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.640
 we continue on the vareilles circle the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:30.870
 straight shoulders in stripes well where you go 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.980
 most active boards for the track 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:40.310
 changing hands in the next 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.310
 diagonal where you go to the very good 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.980
 it goes to the end we could stay 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.810
 among others you will take both 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.810
 large diagonals while trotting 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.049
 two big diagonals yes sailing and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 I arrive at the end on the right 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.720
 I take the diagonal so before r 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.129
 here are the two hands apart so 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.450
 facing his hands in extension 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.129
 queens break legs and wrists 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.129
