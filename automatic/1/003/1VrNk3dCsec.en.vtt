to<00:06:54.180> ask<00:06:54.390> me<00:06:54.780> what<00:06:55.110> is<00:06:55.140> the<00:06:55.380> one<00:06:55.680> thing<00:06:55.710> that<00:06:56.100> I

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
to ask me what is the one thing that I

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.730 
to ask me what is the one thing that I
could<00:06:56.640> do<00:06:56.850> to<00:06:56.880> have<00:06:57.270> better<00:06:57.510> health<00:06:57.780> and<00:06:58.620> the

could do to have better health and the

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.310 
could do to have better health and the
answer<00:06:59.070> would<00:06:59.190> be<00:06:59.250> very<00:06:59.490> simple

the electron rich alkaline fluid so you

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.130 
the electron rich alkaline fluid so you
