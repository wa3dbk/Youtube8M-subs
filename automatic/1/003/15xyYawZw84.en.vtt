changed it from a full point subframe to

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.940 
changed it from a full point subframe to
a<00:02:48.640> six-point<00:02:49.090> subframe<00:02:49.900> now<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.799> will

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
a six-point subframe now that will

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.670 
a six-point subframe now that will
cradle<00:02:51.310> both<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.030> transaxle<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.349> engine

cradle both the transaxle and the engine
and<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.859> suspension<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.390> literally<00:02:55.900> six

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
and the suspension so literally six

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.539 
and the suspension so literally six
bolts<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.799> we<00:02:56.859> can<00:02:56.980> drop<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.400> whole

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
bolts and we can drop the whole

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:09.620 
bolts and we can drop the whole
drivetrain<00:02:57.879> out<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.540> back<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.959> car

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170 

at<00:03:10.200> first<00:03:10.530> glance<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.100> look<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> genesis

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
at first glance you look at the genesis

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
at first glance you look at the genesis
coupe<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.960> it's<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.260> two-door<00:03:13.620> traditional

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
coupe in and it's a two-door traditional

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.020 
coupe in and it's a two-door traditional
coupe<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.860> another<00:03:17.160> side<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.910> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
coupe but another side of it it's a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.840 
coupe but another side of it it's a
four-seat<00:03:18.660> 2-door<00:03:19.410> traditional<00:03:19.950> coupe<00:03:20.130> so

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
four-seat 2-door traditional coupe so

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.460 
four-seat 2-door traditional coupe so
with<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.360> mind<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.870> has<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.080> longer

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
with that in mind it has a longer

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.010 
with that in mind it has a longer
wheelbase<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.130> that's<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.090> what<00:03:24.240> gave

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
wheelbase and that's kind of what gave

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.780 
wheelbase and that's kind of what gave
me<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.530> guys<00:03:25.710> here<00:03:26.010> at<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.160> shop<00:03:26.430> you
