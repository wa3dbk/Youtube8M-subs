camera and we're here with the trick
that<00:00:09.290> we<00:00:09.769> sometimes<00:00:10.130> use<00:00:10.519> on<00:00:10.639> these<00:00:10.730> matrix

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
that we sometimes use on these matrix

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.089 
that we sometimes use on these matrix
dots<00:00:11.389> a<00:00:11.690> lot<00:00:12.139> of<00:00:12.259> people<00:00:12.380> inquire<00:00:12.740> about<00:00:12.860> the

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
dots a lot of people inquire about the

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.369 
dots a lot of people inquire about the
matrix<00:00:13.460> dots<00:00:13.670> and<00:00:13.940> how<00:00:14.089> to<00:00:14.900> deal<00:00:15.049> with<00:00:15.080> them

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
matrix dots and how to deal with them

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.230 
matrix dots and how to deal with them
well<00:00:15.679> this<00:00:15.799> is<00:00:15.950> one<00:00:16.129> of<00:00:16.280> many<00:00:16.490> techniques<00:00:17.000> I've

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
well this is one of many techniques I've

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.240 
well this is one of many techniques I've
seen<00:00:17.450> that<00:00:17.600> work<00:00:17.810> one<00:00:18.710> of<00:00:18.830> my<00:00:18.920> personal

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
major starts at the top and just the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.920 
major starts at the top and just the
same<00:00:25.430> time<00:00:25.670> I've<00:00:25.939> already<00:00:26.180> cleaned<00:00:26.720> and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
same time I've already cleaned and

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.019 
same time I've already cleaned and
prepped<00:00:27.109> the<00:00:27.320> inside<00:00:28.010> of<00:00:28.039> this<00:00:28.160> class<00:00:28.460> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
prepped the inside of this class and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.320 
prepped the inside of this class and
I've<00:00:29.150> already<00:00:29.359> shrunk<00:00:30.019> some<00:00:30.260> tent<00:00:31.180> over<00:00:32.180> this

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
I've already shrunk some tent over this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.390 
I've already shrunk some tent over this
class<00:00:32.599> now<00:00:32.990> I<00:00:33.020> went<00:00:33.470> ahead<00:00:33.530> is<00:00:33.860> if<00:00:34.070> you<00:00:34.190> see

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
class now I went ahead is if you see

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.490 
class now I went ahead is if you see
this<00:00:34.520> up<00:00:34.730> here<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.690> when<00:00:35.870> he<00:00:35.960> had<00:00:35.990> shrunk<00:00:36.320> the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
this up here and when he had shrunk the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.680 
this up here and when he had shrunk the
entire<00:00:36.800> window<00:00:37.250> dots<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.700> off<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.120> then<00:00:38.600> i

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
entire window dots and off and then i

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.600 
entire window dots and off and then i
went<00:00:38.870> back<00:00:39.080> and<00:00:39.140> i<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:39.860> cut<00:00:40.100> at<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.280> bottom

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
went back and i just cut at the bottom

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.490 
went back and i just cut at the bottom
row<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.760> dots<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.240> straight<00:00:41.540> line<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.080> i've

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
row of dots a straight line and i've

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.920 
row of dots a straight line and i've
separated<00:00:42.740> the<00:00:43.220> top<00:00:43.430> part<00:00:43.790> from<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.600> bottom

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
separated the top part from the bottom

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.900 
separated the top part from the bottom
part<00:00:45.110> one<00:00:45.830> of<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.980> reasons<00:00:46.280> i<00:00:46.370> did<00:00:46.580> that<00:00:46.730> is

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
part one of the reasons i did that is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.880 
part one of the reasons i did that is
this<00:00:47.060> is<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.420> cheapest<00:00:48.170> quickest<00:00:48.710> easiest

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
this is the cheapest quickest easiest

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.280 
this is the cheapest quickest easiest
way<00:00:49.280> for<00:00:49.580> me<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.090> have<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.300> pattern<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.900> cut<00:00:51.140> this

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
way for me to have a pattern to cut this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.110 
way for me to have a pattern to cut this
out<00:00:51.470> with<00:00:51.710> i'm<00:00:52.160> just<00:00:52.370> going<00:00:52.490> to<00:00:52.520> use<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:52.850> to

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
out with i'm just going to use this to

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.690 
out with i'm just going to use this to
put<00:00:53.360> on<00:00:53.450> top<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:53.900> black<00:00:54.080> material<00:00:55.070> which

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
put on top of the black material which

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.000 
put on top of the black material which
by<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.910> way<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.240> technique<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:57.080> to<00:00:57.320> put<00:00:57.980> a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
by the way the technique is to put a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.580 
by the way the technique is to put a
black<00:00:58.460> jet<00:00:59.120> black<00:00:59.360> opaque<00:00:59.840> vinyl<00:01:00.350> on<00:01:00.500> the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
black jet black opaque vinyl on the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.670 
black jet black opaque vinyl on the
inside<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:01.280> i'm<00:01:01.700> going<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:01.940> cut<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.210> out<00:01:02.300> to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
inside and i'm going to cut it out to

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.740 
inside and i'm going to cut it out to
duplicate<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:03.860> piece<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.369> tent<00:01:05.239> here<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
duplicate this piece of tent here and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.690 
duplicate this piece of tent here and
then<00:01:06.230> i'm<00:01:06.350> going<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.650> install<00:01:07.040> on<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.370> inside

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
then i'm going to install on the inside

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.620 
then i'm going to install on the inside
i<00:01:07.730> want<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.240> install<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:09.610> after<00:01:10.610> i<00:01:10.820> install<00:01:11.480> the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
i want to install it after i install the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.080 
i want to install it after i install the
10<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.650> going<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.830> be<00:01:12.920> installed<00:01:13.190> last<00:01:13.370> but

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
10 it's going to be installed last but

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
10 it's going to be installed last but
then<00:01:14.210> i<00:01:14.300> want<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.510> take<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.660> to<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.930> glass

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
then i want to take you to the glass

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.320 
then i want to take you to the glass
behind<00:01:15.440> me<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:17.270> show<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.690> how<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:17.930> do<00:01:18.140> this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
behind me and show you how we do this

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.450 
behind me and show you how we do this
you<00:01:20.330> know<00:01:20.390> first<00:01:20.660> we<00:01:20.810> determine<00:01:21.320> which<00:01:22.010> ciders

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
you know first we determine which ciders

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.240 
you know first we determine which ciders
are<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.910> release<00:01:23.240> liner<00:01:23.450> which<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.990> side

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
are the release liner which the side

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.740 
are the release liner which the side
facing<00:01:25.250> me<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:25.850> way<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.030> check<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.600> a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
facing me and one way I check is a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.290 
facing me and one way I check is a
divide<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:27.860> see<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.860> make<00:01:30.890> sure

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
divide it and see just to make sure

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.160 
divide it and see just to make sure
because<00:01:32.300> I<00:01:32.360> didn't<00:01:32.570> want<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.780> release<00:01:32.990> liner

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
because I didn't want the release liner

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.090 
because I didn't want the release liner
facing<00:01:33.650> be<00:01:33.800> in<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.010> example<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:36.020> want<00:01:37.010> to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
facing be in this example and I want to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.230 
facing be in this example and I want to
go<00:01:37.220> ahead<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.870> want<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.080> put<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.350> tent

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
go ahead and I want to put the tent

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.610 
go ahead and I want to put the tent
hiding<00:01:41.240> above<00:01:41.540> knee

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
hiding above knee

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.370 
hiding above knee
so<00:01:44.620> I<00:01:44.680> can<00:01:44.860> see<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.620> take<00:01:47.650> my<00:01:48.010> final<00:01:49.500> ok

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so I can see it then I take my final ok

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
the matrix dots almost identical then I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.380 
the matrix dots almost identical then I

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:08.839 
we can always go back I'd rather cut it

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.509

where I can come back and trim off a
little<00:05:10.639> more<00:05:10.759> than<00:05:10.909> trim<00:05:11.330> too<00:05:11.509> much<00:05:12.399> so<00:05:13.399> I<00:05:13.429> can

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
little more than trim too much so I can

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.229
