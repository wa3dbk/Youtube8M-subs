00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.339
Look

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.219
how good Jaimito

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.300
seems!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.390
Well, don't pretend you are good because we know your not. 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.940
He is a good teaser.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.369
You know what? He knows we 
are talking about him, 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.759
so he is behaving good. 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.659
Today I'm giong to give you a few steps

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:30.610
to prevent 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.700
and avoid that the rabbits 
become agressive. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.839
And this comes in response to several 
requests from all of you, in which you tell us 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:40.790
that you have a rabbit that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.040
has come to bite you.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.000
We have already done a video where we explain that it is unusual

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.010
that a rabbit bites you or 
is agressive. 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920
Today I will tell you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.690
a few guidelines, 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.489
a series of easy instructions you can do at home

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.170
to avoid that this rabbit, 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.770
that has now six months, 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.160
can become an agressive
 rabbit in the future. 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.270
It is more common in
 males than in females....

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.520
And it is because it has very much to do with their character. 
Males, especially 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.130
adult males not neutered, are very territorial and, 
in occasions 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.450
they are agressive with people. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.910
Hey! Another one that wants to be on camera! 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.870
Let's go!

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.870
The first thing we should consider 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.970
is the prevention. 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.210
It's very interesting 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.020
to start training an animal when they are small, 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.380
because if we wait for it be grow up it's character 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.350
will be formed and it will be 
more complicated to modify.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.460
And the second thing we should consider 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.800
is not to fight with the animal. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.060
If we establish

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.030
a series of fights with the animal, 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.490
at the end it will be: who is the best? 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.310
It's even counterproductive because
the animal can get scared

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.280
and then we are going to devote ourselves to fight him. 
And 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370
we don't want to fight, what we want is to 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.889
be friends. 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.869
How will we achieve it? 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.999
Among other things, 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.089
tiring him. 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:15.370
How does a rabbit get tired?

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.850
Making him run, making him play 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.959
and in general making 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.649
him move. 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.309
Another tip, the forth one,

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:25.359
brush 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.949
and clean our rabbit. 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.489
This action, this kind of contact, which we must do weekly 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.290
will submit the animal to our will

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.840
and will make the animal be 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.670
more obidient. 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.400
This way, he will understand, that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.319
he must follow my commands. 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.509
The fifth thing to consider: 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.540
train them,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.269
show them to do things. 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.179
This one has a lot to do with 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.189
 the next one, the sixth one, 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.179
which is to reward him. 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.579
So we will train him with 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.539
treats. 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.379
When it does something we want, that we like 
and that it is doing right, we will

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.289
reward him

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.619
with some of these treats which you can find in many videos, and that we 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:16.370
have a lot. This way

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.530
we will get him or her to like it, because we prize them 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.260
with

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.109
food. 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.079
Seventh thing to consider: 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.479
the walk. 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.620
There are many harnesses that
you can put on 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.420
them to take them out for walks to the park, go walking with them....
This trick is 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.230
related 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.489
to the one I told you earlier about the tiredness. You can take them 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.580
for a walk wherever you want, but always keep in mind that we won't 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.630
bring him to places 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.050
where his predator instict

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.069
can increase, for example, 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.139
somwhere that cats and dogs can atack. 
When you take them for walks, it must

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:54.849
always be with harness

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.599
and you must be aware. 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.839
Let's go 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.659
with the eighth thing we should know:

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.680
the fumble. 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.599
We have to touch our rabbit every day. 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.819
We can't forget that mots of the rabbits 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.519
have a pretty wild genetic and character.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.779
Therefore, the less

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.259
attention we give to the animal and the less contact we have, 
it will become more wild. 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.980
To prevent that since they are small

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.010
we should make contact with them every day many times, if it's possible 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.490
the more people that can touch him, the better. I also 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.300
sometimes recommend to my friends that
 have just got a rabbit, 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.960
that if they go to a friends house or on a trip, that they take the animal 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.440
with them

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.330
 so the animal gets use to 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.650
many

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.809
people and different situations. 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.009
Let's go with the fifth important thing to consider: 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.300
educate it, it must have some rules. 
Did you know that we can teach 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.759
the rabbit to do their poos 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.130
in the cage? 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.190
Well that is a education rule 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.880
that has also a lot in common with 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.319
the rewards. What I mean is: training, 
then treat, teaching, then treat. 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.589
They are three important thing that are related. 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.409
This one has a lot to do with the veterinarian.
The tenth thing to know: 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:13.960
sterilization.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.610
The sexual hormones make the rabbit very agressive, 
especially 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.310
among themselves, 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.379
very territorial, 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.619
therefore, when we sterilize the
 rabbit it becomes much more 

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:25.419
relaxed. 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.159
Am I explaining myself properly? 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.400
And to finish, 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.490
we are going to talk about the 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.139
NO punishments. 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.719
This point is related to the one we talked about NO fighting 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.069
with the animal. 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.449
When we punish the animal we are 
inflicting something negative

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:47.930
against it, because the animal that has already 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.210
a rebellious instinct, and the 
animal with hate us even more. 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.210
So, let's try to do a positive education,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.439
a positive training, 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.510
which is what will really work for us all. 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.559
Now, we are going to say goodbye 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.869
because it looks like our small friend is actually 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.919
studying all the work he has in front of him.
