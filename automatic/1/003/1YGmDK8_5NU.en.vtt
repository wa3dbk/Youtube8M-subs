00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello how are we the team team 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.950
 composed by Carmen RamÃ­rez now of the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.740
 patrick tower cristel ricard and andrea 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.119
 rivas lucila loyal and we're going to talk 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.119
 about the functions of water 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.520
 Water is essential for most 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.310
 the lifestyles known by the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.619
 man including human 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 access to drinking water has been 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.690
 increased during the decades in the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 land surface however 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 Fao studies estimates that 1 of each 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.110
 5 developing countries will have 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 problems of water scarcity before 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.579
 2030 in these countries a minor is vital 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.510
 water consumption in agriculture 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.510
 modernizing the systems above 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.410
 the side is the main one between say 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 component of the human body being 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.030
 human may be without drinking the most 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 five or six days time without putting in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.490
 danger your life the human body has 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 75 percent of water at birth and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.440
 about 60 percent in age 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.750
 adult approximately 60 percent 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.830
 of that water is inside 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.010
 of the cells the schools are called 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.550
 calls 20 cells of our water that 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.770
 it's called extracellular water is what is 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.010
 the it is circulating in the blood of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010
 tissues 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.240
 the body needs about 7 liters 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.560
 water diaries the exact amount varies 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.580
 depending on the level of activity 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.860
 temperature, humidity and other factors 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.410
 most of this water is absorbed 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.590
 with food or drink not strictly 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.750
 water has not been determined the amount 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.270
 exact amount of water to be taken in 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.410
 healthy individuals although a majority of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.080
 experts consider that about 6 to 7 glasses 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.740
 of water daily approximately 2 liters 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.340
 is the minimum necessary to maintain a 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.340
 adequate hydration 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.829
 in mild suitable for human consumption 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.480
 it is called drinking water as you explained 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.900
 water that does not meet the conditions 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.420
 suitable for its consumption can be 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.940
 the identification or 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.280
 through other physical-chemical processes 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.580
 in the face of the difficulty of having water 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.400
 drinking for human consumption in others 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.180
 places on the planet has consolidated 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.480
 intermediate concept the safe water as 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.640
 something that contains dangerous bacteria 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.830
 metals 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 or harmful chemicals for the 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.710
 health and is therefore considered 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.220
 safe to drink 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.790
 therefore it is used when the supply 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.040
 of drinking water is committed 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.129
 it is a water that is not harmful 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.989
 for humans while not fulfilling the 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.989
 ideal conditions for consumption 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.920
 for various reasons the availability 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.770
 of water is this problematic in good 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.690
 part of the world and that's why 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.570
 become one of the main 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.910
 concerns of governments throughout the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.590
 world 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.050
 it is currently estimated that around 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.460
 1000 million people have a 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.190
 Poor access to drinking water 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.040
 this situation is aggravated by the consumption 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.680
 of water in poor conditions that 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.900
 favors proliferation diseases 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.970
 and epidemic outbreaks 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.280
 but because human beings are so 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.159
 fools that we destroy, we annihilate 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.200
 the natural laws are fascinated with 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:01.150
 which we have effectively grown this 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.220
 it's because of the coconut of value that we have 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.500
 our source of life contaminating the and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.170
 destroying the but what the saddest thing 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.439
 of all this is that we are aware 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.390
 because we are not stupid and still 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.819
 we waste the most valuable and sometimes 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.739
 even we want with man is why 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.139
 there is a lot of concern in 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.050
 our time to conserve water and 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.550
 natural resources because then they already 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.960
 they are suffering the consequences of 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.570
 carelessness of man so the means 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.630
 environment the water begins to be scarce in 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.210
 several countries and water is the resource 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.030
 most important in nature because 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.010
 specifically without it there would be no 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.370
 human being and a great variety of 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.370
 species but that is to say that all 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.889
 carmen and let him say this 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.020
 is 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.670
 we generally use with the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.830
 amounts of water for our 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.900
 different to drink to wash the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.150
 Dishes for a teatre shower 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.400
 service system for cooking and for 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.740
 our purposes but not only 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.090
 for domestic purposes the beings 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.470
 humans also use water for 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.610
 example in the industries of the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.100
 agriculture and there are many other 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.690
 activities 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.530
 the ones that can give you water are 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.350
 varied and who you sign in one 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.350
 human consumption as the drink in kitchen 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.260
 food processing number two in 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.450
 personal cleansing number three in the 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.360
 culture of seafood fish or any 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.520
 type of aquatic life number four in 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.440
 agriculture number five in the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.120
 industry number six municipal seven 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:53.060
 recreational number eight transportation of 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.580
 waste as last point we will have the 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.170
 tips to save water one of 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.780
 they would only be using the water 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.910
 strictly necessary take baths 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.570
 shorts closes the key while 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:09.070
 Soaps are the hand showers already 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.110
 that save 10 to 19 liters per bathroom 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:16.270
 health as postulates when you 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.270
 the washing machine with the maximum clothes
