00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.330 
very powerful you look at the close
quarter<00:03:27.540> combat<00:03:27.570> areas<00:03:28.320> however<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.310> I

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
quarter combat areas however I do I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.280 
quarter combat areas however I do I
would<00:03:29.760> say<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.120> ACR<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.660> better<00:03:30.900> overall

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
would say the ACR is better overall

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.520 
would say the ACR is better overall
because<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.220> use<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> long-range<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.630> so

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
because you can use a long-range to so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.660 
because you can use a long-range to so
uh<00:03:34.560> when<00:03:35.460> you<00:03:35.670> uh<00:03:35.870> use<00:03:37.070> ak-47<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.190> yourself<00:03:38.550> if

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
uh when you uh use ak-47 for yourself if

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.910 
uh when you uh use ak-47 for yourself if
you<00:03:38.790> haven't<00:03:39.060> used<00:03:39.240> it<00:03:39.480> because<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> lot<00:03:40.590> of

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
you haven't used it because a lot of

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.710 
you haven't used it because a lot of
people<00:03:41.070> just<00:03:41.370> say<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> case

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
a try and use the proficiency kick + a

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.650 
a try and use the proficiency kick + a
silencer<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.000> will<00:03:51.120> help<00:03:51.300> with<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
silencer and that will help with the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.990 
silencer and that will help with the
recoil<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.430> get<00:03:53.580> used<00:03:53.820> to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
recoil and you just have to get used to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.230 
recoil and you just have to get used to
it<00:03:54.150> because<00:03:54.870> um<00:03:55.260> at<00:03:55.620> first<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.310> must<00:03:56.700> admit<00:03:56.970> that

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
it because um at first I must admit that

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.120
