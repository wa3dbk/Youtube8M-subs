starting<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> new<00:01:36.329> chapter<00:01:36.600> I've<00:01:36.869> been<00:01:36.990> in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
starting a new chapter I've been in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.920 
starting a new chapter I've been in
philly<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:38.150> how<00:01:39.150> long<00:01:39.210> has<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> been<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.780> guess

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
philly for how long has it been I guess

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.050 
philly for how long has it been I guess
I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.229> almost<00:01:40.350> eight<00:01:40.650> years<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.220> less<00:01:42.030> than

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I think almost eight years now less than

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
I think almost eight years now less than
that<00:01:42.299> six<00:01:42.990> years<00:01:43.049> seven<00:01:43.380> years<00:01:43.530> something

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that six years seven years something

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
that six years seven years something
like<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.490> around<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.540> frame<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
like that around that time frame and I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160 
like that around that time frame and I
kind<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.100> wanted<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.659> get<00:01:48.659> back<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> get

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
kind of just wanted to get back to get

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.660 
kind of just wanted to get back to get
