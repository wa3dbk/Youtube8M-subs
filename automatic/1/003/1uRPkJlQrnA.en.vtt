00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
going to be magnetized on and that's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
going to be magnetized on and that's
another<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.570> model<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.110> really

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
another thing about this model is really

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.960

game-wise you know it comes with two of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.910 
game-wise you know it comes with two of
the<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.310> heavy<00:02:17.520> Wraith<00:02:17.730> canons<00:02:18.230> plus<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.770> can

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
add star cannons to it and the first

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.540 
add star cannons to it and the first
thing<00:02:22.200> people<00:02:22.500> were<00:02:22.680> thinking<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.100> wow<00:02:23.250> that's

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
thing people were thinking is wow that's

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.520 
thing people were thinking is wow that's
a<00:02:23.610> lot<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.790> 8p2<00:02:24.210> shots<00:02:24.660> well<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.050> can't<00:02:25.260> fire

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
a lot of 8p2 shots well you can't fire

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.120 
a lot of 8p2 shots well you can't fire
them<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:27.090> only<00:02:27.300> get<00:02:27.750> two<00:02:28.560> shots<00:02:28.830> with

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
them all you only get two shots with

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.300 
them all you only get two shots with
that<00:02:29.160> monstrous<00:02:29.700> creature<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:31.130> what's<00:02:32.130> your

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that monstrous creature so what's your

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.990 
that monstrous creature so what's your
options<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:32.970> options<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:34.790> not<00:02:35.790> as

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
options your options really are not as

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.520 
options your options really are not as
open-ended<00:02:36.720> as<00:02:37.080> they<00:02:37.290> look<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:40.020> either<00:02:40.230> go

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
open-ended as they look you either go

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.949 
open-ended as they look you either go
with<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.010> two<00:02:41.220> rate<00:02:41.400> cannons<00:02:41.880> bare-bones

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
with the two rate cannons bare-bones

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.229 
with the two rate cannons bare-bones
with<00:02:43.709> no<00:02:44.010> additional<00:02:44.520> weapons<00:02:44.880> because<00:02:45.060> it's

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
with no additional weapons because it's

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.780 
with no additional weapons because it's
adding<00:02:45.420> extra<00:02:45.900> weapons<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.500> my<00:02:47.400> opinion

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
adding extra weapons in my opinion

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.530 
adding extra weapons in my opinion
rather<00:02:48.090> pointless<00:02:50.270> especially<00:02:51.270> it's<00:02:51.390> just

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
rather pointless especially it's just

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.880 
rather pointless especially it's just
you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.840> that's<00:02:51.989> redundant<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.560> can't<00:02:52.770> use

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you know that's redundant you can't use

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.690 
you know that's redundant you can't use
them<00:02:53.030> can't<00:02:54.030> use<00:02:54.180> them<00:02:54.330> altogether<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.700> your

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
them can't use them altogether so your

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520 
them can't use them altogether so your
best<00:02:56.970> bet<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.450> my<00:02:57.480> opinion<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.050> either<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
best bet in my opinion is either do the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.640 
best bet in my opinion is either do the
two<00:02:58.680> Wraith<00:02:58.860> cannons<00:02:59.310> or<00:02:59.520> do<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:01.200> think

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
two Wraith cannons or do the the I think

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.990 
two Wraith cannons or do the the I think
I<00:03:01.830> don't<00:03:02.070> remember<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.520> their<00:03:02.640> weapons

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
I don't remember what their weapons

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.810 
I don't remember what their weapons
called<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.480> big<00:03:04.020> melee<00:03:04.650> weapon<00:03:05.190> which<00:03:05.370> makes<00:03:05.640> it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
called a big melee weapon which makes it

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.420 
called a big melee weapon which makes it
must<00:03:06.030> master<00:03:06.750> crafted<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:08.250> these

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
must master crafted and in these

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.120 
must master crafted and in these
shielding<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:10.110> then<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.530> add<00:03:10.739> star

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
shielding and then you can add star

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.580 
shielding and then you can add star
cannons<00:03:11.670> which<00:03:12.480> would<00:03:12.660> go<00:03:12.840> up<00:03:13.050> here<00:03:13.350> up<00:03:13.560> top<00:03:15.590> or

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
cannons which would go up here up top or

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.310 
cannons which would go up here up top or
the<00:03:17.489> other<00:03:17.610> comes<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.019> desire

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the other comes if you if you so desire

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.900 
the other comes if you if you so desire
but<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:21.360> really<00:03:22.170> don't<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.709> other<00:03:22.910> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
but I really don't like the other the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.880 
but I really don't like the other the
other<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.600> start<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:25.080> at<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.680> Sun

looking at three thirty or so points and

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.319 
looking at three thirty or so points and
I<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.810> can't<00:03:43.079> see<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.260> being<00:03:44.030> game<00:03:45.030> wise

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
I just can't see that being game wise

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.170 
I just can't see that being game wise

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
well-thought-out really well-designed so

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.349 
well-thought-out really well-designed so
the<00:04:14.579> design<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.060> model<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.420> fantastic<00:04:17.359> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the design of the model is fantastic the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.640 
the design of the model is fantastic the
size<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.959> model<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.380> fun<00:04:20.180> game<00:04:21.180> wise<00:04:21.650> and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
size of the model is fun game wise and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.450 
size of the model is fun game wise and
for<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.400> much<00:04:23.640> money<00:04:23.669> for<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.240> points<00:04:24.770> yeah

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
for that much money for the points yeah

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.700 
for that much money for the points yeah
probably<00:04:26.729> not<00:04:26.960> but<00:04:27.960> other<00:04:28.289> than<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.440> I'm
