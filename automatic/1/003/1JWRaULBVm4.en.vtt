00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
without having to sand back to the wood

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
without having to sand back to the wood
for<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> sunburst<00:01:00.449> type<00:01:00.750> finish<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> want

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
for a sunburst type finish where I want

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.080 
for a sunburst type finish where I want
to<00:01:01.620> pop<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> green<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> accentuate<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to pop the green and accentuate the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.759 
to pop the green and accentuate the
grain<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.449> show<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.140> start<00:01:04.650> by

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
grain and show it off I start by

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
grain and show it off I start by
painting<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> guitar<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> black<00:01:06.299> dye

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
painting the guitar with a black dye

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.320 
painting the guitar with a black dye
this<00:01:07.530> dye<00:01:07.770> could<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.159> alcohol<00:01:08.369> soluble<00:01:09.000> or

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this dye could be alcohol soluble or

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
this dye could be alcohol soluble or
water<00:01:09.600> soluble<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.470> difference<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
water soluble now the difference is that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
water soluble now the difference is that
the<00:01:11.430> alcohol<00:01:11.909> flashes<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:12.510> quickly

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the alcohol flashes off quickly

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
the alcohol flashes off quickly
therefore<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.369> dye<00:01:14.580> doesn't<00:01:15.000> penetrate

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
therefore the the dye doesn't penetrate

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.630 
therefore the the dye doesn't penetrate
as<00:01:15.540> deeply<00:01:15.810> into<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> wood<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.590> water<00:01:17.189> soluble

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
as deeply into the wood a water soluble

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
as deeply into the wood a water soluble
dye<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.330> will<00:01:18.450> penetrate<00:01:18.750> deeper<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
dye it will penetrate deeper into the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.249 
dye it will penetrate deeper into the
wood<00:01:19.920> once<00:01:20.820> I've<00:01:21.000> painted<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.570> surface<00:01:22.080> with

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
wood once I've painted the surface with

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.320 
wood once I've painted the surface with
the<00:01:22.380> black<00:01:22.560> dial<00:01:23.040> ette<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.280> dry<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the black dial ette it dry and then I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.100 
the black dial ette it dry and then I
sand<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
sand it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
sand it
I<00:01:25.140> don't<00:01:25.560> sand<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.340> because

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I don't sand it all the way off because

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.039 
I don't sand it all the way off because
it<00:01:26.850> goes<00:01:27.119> pretty<00:01:27.420> deep<00:01:27.540> into<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> wood

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it goes pretty deep into the wood

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
it goes pretty deep into the wood
specially<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.950> water-based<00:01:29.430> dye

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
specially if you use the water-based dye

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.789 
specially if you use the water-based dye
I<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> pop<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.380> grain<00:01:31.619> or

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I just want to pop the grain or

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
I just want to pop the grain or
accentuate<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> grain<00:01:32.640> next<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.509> apply<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
accentuate the grain next I apply a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
accentuate the grain next I apply a
vinyl<00:01:34.259> sealer<00:01:34.799> now<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.250> helps<00:01:35.460> seal<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.060> any

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
vinyl sealer now this helps seal in any

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
vinyl sealer now this helps seal in any
contaminants<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> leveling<00:01:37.979> agent

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
contaminants is also a leveling agent

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.289 
contaminants is also a leveling agent
it's<00:01:38.430> easily<00:01:38.579> sandable

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it's easily sandable

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.630 
it's easily sandable
however<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.920> apply<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.460> color

results<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> sand<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> way

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
results you have to sand it all the way

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.870 
results you have to sand it all the way
off<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.780> means<00:01:48.990> sanding<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> wood

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
off and that means sanding the wood

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.280 
off and that means sanding the wood
usually<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.450> add<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> color<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
usually what I do is I add the color to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
usually what I do is I add the color to
the<00:01:52.409> lacquer<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.610> using<00:01:53.759> lacquer

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the lacquer if I'm using lacquer

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.670 
the lacquer if I'm using lacquer
sometimes<00:01:54.450> these<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.780> products<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.590> if

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
sometimes these other products but if

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.260 
sometimes these other products but if
I'm<00:01:55.829> using<00:01:55.950> lacquer<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.430> add<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> dye<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
I'm using lacquer I add the dye to the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.929 
I'm using lacquer I add the dye to the
Lac<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.869> diluted<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.590> 50%<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Lac and then I diluted about 50% that

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.789 
Lac and then I diluted about 50% that
way<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.119> get<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.930> thin<00:02:01.229> color<00:02:01.530> coat

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
way I get a very very thin color coat

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
way I get a very very thin color coat
and<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.070> lacquer<00:02:02.310> serves<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> binding

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and the lacquer serves as a binding

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.020 
and the lacquer serves as a binding
agent<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> spray<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> guitar<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.640> careful

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
agent and I spray the guitar be careful

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.880 
agent and I spray the guitar be careful
because<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.719> spray<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.500> darker

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
because the more you spray the darker

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.219 
because the more you spray the darker
things<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.239> doing<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> sunburst<00:02:09.989> type

the<00:02:11.879> perimeter<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> spray<00:02:12.750> more<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.200> those

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the perimeter I spray more in those

the perimeter I spray more in those
areas<00:02:13.920> or<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.490> add<00:02:15.180> more<00:02:15.510> dye<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> mix<00:02:16.740> so

it's more concentrated I dialed down the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.950 
it's more concentrated I dialed down the
width<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> fan<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.580> my<00:02:20.730> spray<00:02:21.060> gun<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.810> I'm
