00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.980
 extension would be from me I'm proud 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.950
 that today 's review to us 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.019
 headphones from the home jabra biz around 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.030
 the model called fox i had this one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.860
 headphone now for some time in the test 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.269
 and want to be easy in this video today 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.279
 My experiences with these 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.140
 earphones have collected with you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 otherwise share if you are now 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 this headphones will be ordered here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.260
 all delivered in this box and in the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.519
 scope of delivery is also a small one 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.320
 transport bag for the headphones 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 contain and also still different 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.420
 attachments leaving the headphones in the end 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
 also really fit in every ear perfectly 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.010
 otherwise we should look at that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 all now something just by design 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 technical approach we have here now 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 a one-meter 20-long cable with the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.219
 wrapped in a starched tissue tape 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.149
 that means that the cable is something 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 stiffer and thus the annoying 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.510
 knotting the headphones is prevented 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.550
 and by the specially shaped 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 essays sits the whole really 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
 very good in the ear and the case not at 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.489
 every little train out so that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.290
 If you have the headphones now when 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.270
 run or used and sometimes easy 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.430
 rankommt to the cable will not let 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
 should immediately be out of your ear 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 another advantage that the headphones 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.369
 Offer here is now this little one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.830
 remote so we can now use 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.049
 This small remote control is convenient without 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.770
 everytime bring out our smartphone 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.140
 to have to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.150
 Of course, you can also make and receive calls 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.200
 listen to music about it and if 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 We in the middle of this button 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.049
 press if you pause the music or 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 accept or hang up a call 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.880
 we can also go directly from here 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.259
 already the volume adjust it further 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.780
 then he has a small one too 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.280
 feature the headphones then in here 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.960
 to be held together in the middle 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.670
 can through this magnet here 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 otherwise i can give you the sound of this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.299
 Sorry, unfortunately, not about the video 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.189
 But I can show you in any case 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.380
 guarantee that this headphones have a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.450
 have a very good pass for the people 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.430
 where do I like this headphones 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.829
 Here in any case therefore recommend 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 Definitely very suitable for rap 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.549
 music hip hop and so on everyone 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.219
 case for dubstep and so on so 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.649
 music where as a lot of bass included 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.530
 is and the best thing about it is you 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.120
 can with the app called japan sound the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.069
 whole then again specifically 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.739
 So optimize the app was special 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.629
 developed for android and ios and 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.299
 then it could simply be the deep ones 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.610
 or to optimize the dynamics of the sound 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.560
 and can just as I said the sound 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.080
 set it up for you then 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.450
 personally optimally adapted 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.549
 otherwise I'm very much on the whole 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.459
 happy with these headphones and for 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.140
 a price of about 50 euro gets 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.750
