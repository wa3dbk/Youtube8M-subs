keep<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> runs<00:00:52.890> coming<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> my<00:00:55.079> rig<00:00:55.350> for

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
keep the runs coming this is my rig for

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.540 
keep the runs coming this is my rig for
fishing<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:55.890> tiger<00:00:56.250> nuts

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
fishing with tiger nuts

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.220 
fishing with tiger nuts
slightly<00:00:56.969> different<00:00:57.420> from<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.660> boilie<00:00:58.020> rigs

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
slightly different from a boilie rigs

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.170 
slightly different from a boilie rigs
basically<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> tiger<00:00:59.730> nuts<00:00:59.879> are<00:01:00.030> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
basically because the tiger nuts are so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.580 
basically because the tiger nuts are so
light<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:00.899> you've<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.170> very<00:01:01.350> light

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
light and when you've got a very light

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
light and when you've got a very light
hook<00:01:01.770> bait<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> tendency<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> get

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
hook bait on there is a tendency to get

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.200 
hook bait on there is a tendency to get
tangled<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.619> I've<00:01:04.920> conveyed<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.820> several

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
tangled so I've conveyed that in several

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
tangled so I've conveyed that in several
ways<00:01:06.360> first<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.140> I've<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.650> cue<00:01:08.010> 2/1

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
ways first of all I've got i cue 2/1

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.490 
ways first of all I've got i cue 2/1
which<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> soft<00:01:09.000> fluorocarbon<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.260> still

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
which is a soft fluorocarbon but still

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
which is a soft fluorocarbon but still
has<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.950> anti<00:01:11.220> tangle<00:01:11.460> qualities<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
has some anti tangle qualities this is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
has some anti tangle qualities this is
the<00:01:12.450> 15<00:01:12.869> pound<00:01:13.200> breaking<00:01:13.890> strain<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.430> most

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the 15 pound breaking strain but most

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.810 
the 15 pound breaking strain but most
importantly<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.100> LED<00:01:17.100> end<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.580> I've

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
importantly at the LED end there I've

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.670 
importantly at the LED end there I've
got<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.090> anti-tangle<00:01:18.600> sleeve<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.560> what

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
got an anti-tangle sleeve and what

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.929 
got an anti-tangle sleeve and what
that's<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> push

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that's going to do it's going to push

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
that's going to do it's going to push
everything<00:01:21.659> away<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> tubing<00:01:22.799> in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
everything away from the tubing in

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.289 
everything away from the tubing in
flight<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> stop<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.240> all

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
flight so it's going to stop it from all

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
flight so it's going to stop it from all
folding<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> getting<00:01:25.890> around<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
folding back and getting around the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
folding back and getting around the
tubing<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.420> obviously<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> hits

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
tubing and what obviously when it hits

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
tubing and what obviously when it hits
the<00:01:28.259> bottom<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> also<00:01:28.890> helps<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.369> push

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the bottom it also helps to push

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
the bottom it also helps to push
everything<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.180> flat<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> hooklink<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
everything out flat so the hooklink is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
everything out flat so the hooklink is
nice<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> straight<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.540> talking<00:01:33.689> from

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900

off the bottom there's all them tiger

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310 
off the bottom there's all them tiger
nuts<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> feed<00:01:51.479> they're<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.869> buried<00:01:52.140> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
nuts that you feed they're all buried in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
nuts that you feed they're all buried in
the<00:01:52.470> sediment<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.250> fish<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.579> rooting<00:01:53.880> around

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the sediment the fish are rooting around

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.550 
the sediment the fish are rooting around
for<00:01:54.240> them<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> want

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
for them and I don't think you want

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
for them and I don't think you want
something<00:01:55.920> that's<00:01:56.009> standing<00:01:56.490> upright<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
something that's standing upright so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
something that's standing upright so
basically<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> bottom<00:01:58.259> nut<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.740> almost

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
basically the bottom nut is almost

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
basically the bottom nut is almost
touching<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> bottom<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> light<00:02:00.299> bead

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
touching the bottom of the light bead

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.999 
touching the bottom of the light bead
and<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> way<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and that's the way I think you get the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.550 
and that's the way I think you get the
mouse<00:02:02.219> bites<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.180> hook<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> size<00:02:03.869> 2<00:02:04.200> curve

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
mouse bites the hook is a size 2 curve

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
mouse bites the hook is a size 2 curve
looks<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.399> excessive<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.299> little

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
looks a bit excessive for that little

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510 
looks a bit excessive for that little
tiny<00:02:06.750> hook<00:02:07.020> bait<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.340> we've

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
tiny hook bait but I really like we've

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.699 
tiny hook bait but I really like we've
done<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.759> fishing<00:02:09.060> bottom<00:02:09.450> bait<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> big

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
done on fishing bottom bait with a big

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.199 
done on fishing bottom bait with a big
hook<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> small<00:02:11.459> bait<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.879> think<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
hook and a small bait I think you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.940 
hook and a small bait I think you
convert<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.230> more<00:02:13.410> pickup

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
convert a lot more pickup

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.640 
convert a lot more pickup
into<00:02:14.340> fishing<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.790> net<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.900> tied<00:02:16.230> be

favorite whipping knot onto the hook

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.490 
favorite whipping knot onto the hook
first<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:21.239> make<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> big<00:02:21.660> loop<00:02:21.870> underneath<00:02:22.349> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
first you make a big loop underneath the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040 
first you make a big loop underneath the
hook<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:24.000> tiny<00:02:24.209> take<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.630> poking

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
hook and then little tiny take in poking

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.199 
hook and then little tiny take in poking
out<00:02:25.200> grab<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.709> front<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.190> loop<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.819> wrap

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
out grab the front of the loop and wrap

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.790 
out grab the front of the loop and wrap
it<00:02:27.360> around<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.780> hook<00:02:27.870> once<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
it around the hook once going up the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.620 
it around the hook once going up the
hook<00:02:28.980> then<00:02:29.489> wrap<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.760> around<00:02:29.970> again<00:02:30.450> going

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
hook then wrap it around again going

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.110 
hook then wrap it around again going
down<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.290> carry<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:31.830> down<00:02:32.190> towards

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
down and carry on going down towards

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.490 
down and carry on going down towards
your<00:02:33.180> fingertips<00:02:33.690> probably<00:02:34.080> four<00:02:34.319> or<00:02:34.350> five

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
your fingertips probably four or five

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.710 
your fingertips probably four or five
times<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> tag<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.360> pulls

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
times and then the tag in pulls

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
times and then the tag in pulls
everything<00:02:37.260> tight<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> knot<00:02:38.550> is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
everything tight and then the knot is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.509 
everything tight and then the knot is
formed<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:39.900> cut<00:02:40.170> off<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.530> tag<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.040> pull

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
formed you then cut off that tag in pull

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.460 
formed you then cut off that tag in pull
it<00:02:41.550> up<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> hook<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:42.900> basically<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it up the hook and then basically the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.140 
it up the hook and then basically the
rest<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> hooklink<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.519> tied<00:02:44.760> from<00:02:44.940> then

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
rest of the hooklink is tied from then

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.479 
rest of the hooklink is tied from then
on<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.690> little<00:02:45.870> tiny<00:02:46.080> micro<00:02:46.590> rig<00:02:47.130> swivel

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
on so the little tiny micro rig swivel

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.670 
on so the little tiny micro rig swivel
goes<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.910> next<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.989> simply<00:02:49.260> tie<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
goes on next and then I simply tie the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.800 
goes on next and then I simply tie the
knot<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.100> knot<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.850> that's<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.150> six<00:02:51.390> turn<00:02:51.600> not

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
knot this knot so that's a six turn not

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.360 
knot this knot so that's a six turn not
let's<00:02:51.989> not<00:02:52.140> I've<00:02:52.260> done<00:02:52.470> there<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.130> make<00:02:53.340> sure

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
let's not I've done there but make sure

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.890 
let's not I've done there but make sure
you<00:02:53.700> come<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.269> hook<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.569> can<00:02:54.720> see

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you come out of the hook you can see

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.830 
you come out of the hook you can see
there<00:02:55.110> on<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> inside<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.150> hook<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
there on the inside of the hook so the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.210 
there on the inside of the hook so the
point<00:02:58.110> side<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> hook<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.010> so

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
point side of the hook that is so

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100 
point side of the hook that is so
important<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.180> make<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.480> hook<00:03:00.660> turn<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
important to make the hook turn and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.140 
important to make the hook turn and
catch<00:03:01.260> hold<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.160> stiffness<00:03:02.760> that's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
catch hold and that stiffness that's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.580 
catch hold and that stiffness that's
coming<00:03:03.390> out<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> eye<00:03:03.690> there<00:03:04.110> he's<00:03:04.410> going<00:03:04.530> to

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
coming out the eye there he's going to

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.289 
coming out the eye there he's going to
help<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.860> hook<00:03:05.010> turn<00:03:05.190> as<00:03:05.370> well<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.180> don't

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
help the hook turn as well so you don't

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.059 
help the hook turn as well so you don't
need<00:03:06.510> shrink<00:03:06.810> tube<00:03:07.110> or<00:03:07.350> line<00:03:07.530> align<00:03:07.860> or

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
need shrink tube or line align or

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.650 
need shrink tube or line align or
anything<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.610> that's<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> turn

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
anything like that that's going to turn

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.630 
anything like that that's going to turn
the<00:03:09.840> hook<00:03:09.989> well<00:03:10.170> enough<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.530> its<00:03:10.680> own<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.549> then

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
the hook well enough on its own and then

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.979 
the hook well enough on its own and then
in<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.910> middle<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.390> hook<00:03:12.540> link<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.870> help

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
in the middle of the hook link to help

sinker I don't put any putty on this

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.979 
sinker I don't put any putty on this
because<00:03:17.730> putties<00:03:18.120> another<00:03:18.450> thing<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.840> can

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
out if you put it too close to the hook

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.050 
out if you put it too close to the hook

what tends to happen the hook sinks

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.090 
what tends to happen the hook sinks
fastest<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.109> get<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> loop<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.769> off<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
bottom of the hook link and I recommend

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.710 
bottom of the hook link and I recommend
you<00:03:38.250> always<00:03:38.700> put<00:03:38.940> your<00:03:39.030> rigs<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.420> Aged

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
you always put your rigs in the Aged

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.539 
you always put your rigs in the Aged
drop<00:03:40.230> them<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.560> like<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.920> would<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.250> cast

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
drop them in like you would on a cast

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.699 
drop them in like you would on a cast
and<00:03:41.880> see<00:03:42.420> how<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.810> sits<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> bottom<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.590> it

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
and see how it sits on the bottom do it

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.440 
and see how it sits on the bottom do it
half<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.010> dozen<00:03:44.040> times<00:03:44.280> ten<00:03:44.790> times<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.420> just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
half a dozen times ten times and just

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.210 
half a dozen times ten times and just
make<00:03:45.959> sure<00:03:46.109> it's<00:03:46.470> sitting<00:03:46.680> out<00:03:46.859> nice<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
make sure it's sitting out nice and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.460 
make sure it's sitting out nice and
straight<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:48.000> nice<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.750> flat<00:03:48.930> every<00:03:49.109> time

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
straight and nice and flat every time

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.890 
straight and nice and flat every time
and<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.790> anti-tangle<00:03:51.269> sleeve<00:03:51.420> that's<00:03:51.840> a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
and then the anti-tangle sleeve that's a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.630 
and then the anti-tangle sleeve that's a
dark<00:03:52.109> matter<00:03:52.350> one<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.769> it's<00:03:52.920> got<00:03:53.040> tungsten<00:03:53.549> in

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
dark matter one so it's got tungsten in

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.430 
dark matter one so it's got tungsten in
it<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:54.180> helps<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.630> hold<00:03:54.750> everything<00:03:55.079> down<00:03:55.410> on

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
it that helps to hold everything down on

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.170 
it that helps to hold everything down on
the<00:03:55.650> bottom<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.519> pushed<00:03:56.880> over<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the bottom that's pushed over a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120 
the bottom that's pushed over a
quick-change<00:03:57.480> swivel<00:03:58.200> that's<00:03:58.799> something

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
quick-change swivel that's something

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.830 
quick-change swivel that's something
that<00:03:59.250> I'm<00:03:59.370> testing<00:04:00.150> at<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.299> moment<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
that I'm testing at the moment and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.270 
that I'm testing at the moment and
that's<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.200> gone<00:04:01.350> into<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> standard<00:04:02.069> lead

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
that's just gone into a standard lead

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.920 
that's just gone into a standard lead
clip<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.180> see<00:04:03.450> there<00:04:03.600> I've<00:04:03.720> got<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
clip and you can see there I've got a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.750 
clip and you can see there I've got a
cog<00:04:04.200> lid<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.650> but<00:04:04.859> I'm<00:04:04.950> not<00:04:05.069> fishing<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.519> cold

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
cog lid on but I'm not fishing it cold

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.000 
cog lid on but I'm not fishing it cold
style<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.720> reason<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:07.109> that<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.410> they<00:04:07.799> cast

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
style the reason for that is they cast

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.800 
style the reason for that is they cast
almost<00:04:08.430> as<00:04:08.579> far<00:04:08.790> as<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> standard<00:04:09.420> led<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
almost as far as a standard led in the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.629 
almost as far as a standard led in the
same<00:04:10.049> size<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.980> means<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.280> don't<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.579> to

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
same size and it means I don't have to

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.490 
same size and it means I don't have to
bring<00:04:11.790> two<00:04:12.000> sets<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.389> leads<00:04:12.600> with<00:04:12.750> me<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.109> if

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
bring two sets of leads with me so if

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.140 
bring two sets of leads with me so if
I'm<00:04:13.590> going<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.799> swap<00:04:13.980> over<00:04:14.100> two<00:04:14.370> boilies<00:04:14.819> I'd

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
I'm going to swap over two boilies I'd

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.000 
I'm going to swap over two boilies I'd
fish<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.630> Cox<00:04:15.840> style<00:04:16.169> because<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.620> boil<00:04:16.829> is

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
fish it Cox style because the boil is

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
fish it Cox style because the boil is
that<00:04:17.160> much<00:04:17.340> heavier<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:18.209> keeps<00:04:18.419> everything

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
that much heavier it keeps everything

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.569 
that much heavier it keeps everything
apart<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.320> flight<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.250> don't<00:04:20.459> get

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
apart in flight and you don't get

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.940 
apart in flight and you don't get
tangles<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> then<00:04:21.930> last<00:04:22.380> but<00:04:22.620> by<00:04:22.650> no<00:04:22.770> means

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
tangles and then last but by no means

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.770 
tangles and then last but by no means
least<00:04:23.280> which<00:04:23.970> has<00:04:24.060> got<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> rubber<00:04:24.450> connector

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
least which has got a rubber connector

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.080 
least which has got a rubber connector
on<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.260> back<00:04:25.409> of<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.680> lead<00:04:25.860> clip<00:04:26.130> make<00:04:26.789> it's

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
on the back of that lead clip make it's

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.970 
on the back of that lead clip make it's
got<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> bit<00:04:27.390> stop

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
got a bit stop

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.740 
got a bit stop
to<00:04:28.280> been<00:04:28.460> pushed<00:04:28.670> into<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.240> again<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.660> a

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
to been pushed into it this again is a

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.630 
to been pushed into it this again is a
prototype<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:30.860> it's<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.040> very<00:04:31.220> light<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:31.610> color

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
prototype so it's a very light in color

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.310 
prototype so it's a very light in color
because<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.240> bottom<00:04:32.480> here<00:04:32.660> at<00:04:32.750> gigantic<00:04:33.260> er

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
because the bottom here at gigantic er

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.990 
because the bottom here at gigantic er
is<00:04:33.470> light<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:33.860> color<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:34.820> just

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
is light in color and that just

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.850 
is light in color and that just
completes<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.540> setup<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:36.110> think<00:04:36.500> it's<00:04:36.650> really

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
completes the setup I think it's really

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.320 
completes the setup I think it's really
important<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.400> have<00:04:37.490> something<00:04:37.760> behind<00:04:38.030> the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
important to have something behind the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.360 
important to have something behind the
lid<00:04:38.480> that<00:04:38.660> again<00:04:38.930> stalks<00:04:39.230> tangles<00:04:39.770> but<00:04:40.280> it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
lid that again stalks tangles but it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.920 
lid that again stalks tangles but it
also<00:04:40.520> protects<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.300> fish<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.660> when<00:04:41.810> you're

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
also protects the fish so when you're

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.750 
also protects the fish so when you're
playing<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.290> fish<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.800> that's<00:04:43.430> rubbing

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
playing the fish is that that's rubbing

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.730 
playing the fish is that that's rubbing
up<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.030> down<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.330> side<00:04:44.540> of<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.780> fish<00:04:45.020> not<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
up and down the side of the fish not the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.460 
up and down the side of the fish not the
main<00:04:46.040> line<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:47.060> that's<00:04:47.420> my<00:04:47.570> tiger<00:04:47.900> nut<00:04:48.020> rig<00:04:48.260> I'm
