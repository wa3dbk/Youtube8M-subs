00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.049
 problem because this is rubbish 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.810
 even cut a piece of grass out of nothing 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:50.269
 a little bit because of the half here in the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:52.580
 front of the house goes to the wood with this 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.650
 that grass 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.850
 Look at the brushcutter I started by cutting this 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.170
 huge piece of grass to proceed to 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.850
 program 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.940
 the piece of grass that I started to 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.350
 to cut, not even grass is an act 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:14.090
 brutal and you cut and cut here in the 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.019
 In front of this little piece I cut only 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.850
 this grass 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.530
 I started to cut back there must have 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.350
 a machine, or no one gives a damn 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.970
 mouth changing the hero in that garbage 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.760
 black decker 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.239
 I bought one of the technique that is stronger 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:39.019
 of the island 800 watts dise that he is 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.660
 manufactured in Brazil the technique until 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.380
 nor of the night that matters much of the 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.500
 China 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.230
 I think they bring mounts in Brazil but 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.440
 the quality does not even match his body 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.440
 It's all this metal that 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.739
 has boys fit much stronger the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.739
 his trigger is much lighter 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.610
 according to vendors that model there 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.459
 I bought a book that he's only for 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.919
 to stop like a stop 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.410
 they do not tell us tried 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.790
 cut and shaquille grass as a cubicle 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.860
 from each other 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.570
 so I was satisfied with the one that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.820
 Now you have some problem, I'll go. 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.340
 post a video for you but comparing 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.890
 with a little more expensive it 's worth the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.230
 people because that there is very bad 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.140
 by the right side sold by the home 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.690
 example 89 real in china without paying 20 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.620
 real each one then that's the tip 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.740
 It is a prestige industry prioritize 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.480
 national and learn the next I'll go 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.430
 look for those made in Brazil that 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.430
 all are better
