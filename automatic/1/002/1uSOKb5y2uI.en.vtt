00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 if you are a camel you live in then 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.400
 the desert this question refers to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.940
 a big secret that during the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.139
 last episode was revealed and around the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.360
 to answer question 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.160
 unfortunately no i do not live in the desert 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 but here in the middle of Germany and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 especially now in the winter months 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.660
 I already suffered a lot from that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.220
 For one thing, there are hardly any others here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.570
 channels and we are too 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.750
 just not made for such a cold 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 I mean have you ever seen a camel 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 at the snowball fight or andromeda 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.700
 the free amount of snow makes yes 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.590
 I probably would not have too 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.230
 I do not want to stay here anymore 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.230
 live longer because I am a camel 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.730
 I am a camel 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 And that's exactly why there is 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.680
 brand new the very first winter 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.060
 Collection exclusively for camels only 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.140
 www.peta.de hey people what is going on 100 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 that a stupid beginning 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.740
 I warmly welcome you to one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.670
 new episode of ask tobi and i want 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.630
 not too long for the bush 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 here are your questions 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.580
 that was the wrong page now though 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.690
 embarrassing what do you think of that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.700
 spelling some youtube 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.780
 comments on my own audience 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.399
 I have to say that it usually 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.750
 really clear when you go 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.070
 But sometimes the comments to many 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.509
 other youtube channel looks at 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
 you are still partly really 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.710
 interesting to the word creations but 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.119
 I would not I when I look at it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.830
 would not do the job against 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 to act on these abuses german 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.290
 learn with tobi 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.260
 Welcome to learn German 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.600
 with and as my name is professor tobi 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.910
 and in this show I show them how 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.100
 you really German makes us look 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.860
 but first of all how good she already is 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.540
 German can do why you have no 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.290
 upload video 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.290
 are you dead 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.820
 now I want you to stop me 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 question 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.730
 ok now you can continue now 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.480
 I want you personally too 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.430
 to get to know 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 but that does not leave a problem 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.320
 Let's go on a date . Hey, I'm glad 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 to see you and how are you 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.270
 actually anyone ever told 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.880
 that you just 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.930
 well be pretty be that you 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.260
 somehow not very talkative 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.260
 is 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.760
 I go to toilet very quickly 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.600
 when right back goes with maria 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.070
 which languages speak 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.269
 I speak German fluently and 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.290
 English and then still the school 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.260
 a bit Russian and French 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.489
 but it would be a lie to say that 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.380
 the two really mastered that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.310
 is really just a little bit and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.630
 In addition, this binary code still speak 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.130
 so believe me this courage falls to me 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.350
 just successfully the lower jaw 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.370
 dislocated what do you think of Harry 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.900
 Potter I am a huge Harry 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.040
 potter fan the first hour already as 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.360
 very little child before always from 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.410
 my mother and my grandma from the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.510
 read books 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.450
 then I have all the books and movies 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.620
 and video games absolutely wanted and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.090
 I even believe in carnival 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.110
 or gone as a harry disguised 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.580
 unfortunately I have no picture of it anymore 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.150
 found but just about collects 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.150
 like this 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.530
 I was also in Cologne at the end of last year 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.240
 at the harry potter exhibition where one 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.590
 whole lot of original props and 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.000
 Costumes from the different movie 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.540
 were exhibited and I'm easy 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.370
 only the absolutely biggest fan died 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.200
 I'm in Cologne right now 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.940
 Harry Potter's exhibition is so awesome 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.470
 You just see how much I love in 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.970
 every single pass somewhere in the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.200
 background around not stuck and in everyone 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.940
 costume what the actors 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.300
 a fanboy heart beats each other 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.300
 more quickly 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.080
 and apart from that I'm natural 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.580
 even in the house for seven years 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.750
 gone to school but I hope 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.400
 that video games like it 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.780
 if yes then click down there and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.239

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.980
 obi or up there because there is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.940
 my last video was very, very 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.320
 had a lot of fun 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.400
 Thanks for turning on and I hope you 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.170

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.300

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.290
 just given sacrifice 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:43.320

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:43.320
