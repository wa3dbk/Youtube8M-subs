all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.199> want<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.469> know<00:00:01.560> how<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.829> hook

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
all right you want to know how to hook

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.809 
all right you want to know how to hook
up<00:00:02.159> little<00:00:02.610> gas<00:00:02.820> lines<00:00:04.190> first<00:00:05.190> off<00:00:05.430> let<00:00:05.730> me

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
up little gas lines first off let me

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.770 
up little gas lines first off let me
tell<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.779> fuel<00:00:08.300> has<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.540> three

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
tell you that the fuel has the three

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780 
tell you that the fuel has the three
settings<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.429> right<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
settings the one on the right of the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.870 
settings the one on the right of the
right<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> prime<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.559> will<00:00:14.070> allow<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.549> gas

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
right is a prime that will allow the gas

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
right is a prime that will allow the gas
to<00:00:14.940> flow<00:00:15.420> constantly<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.890> want<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
to flow constantly you do not want to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.070 
to flow constantly you do not want to
run<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.520> motorcycle<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.960> on

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
run your motorcycle on that the one on

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.830 
run your motorcycle on that the one on
the<00:00:19.140> bottom<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:20.150> that<00:00:21.150> works<00:00:21.539> off<00:00:21.810> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the bottom there on that works off of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.800 
the bottom there on that works off of
vacuum<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.220> take<00:00:23.580> your<00:00:23.760> tank<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
vacuum you can take your tank off in the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080 
vacuum you can take your tank off in the
on<00:00:24.960> position<00:00:24.990> without<00:00:25.680> any<00:00:25.830> gas<00:00:26.340> leaking<00:00:26.910> out

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
on position without any gas leaking out

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.830 
on position without any gas leaking out
of<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:28.160> reserve<00:00:29.160> obviously<00:00:30.090> same<00:00:30.539> thing

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of that reserve obviously same thing

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560 
of that reserve obviously same thing
it's<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> let<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> gas<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it's going to let all the gas out in the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's going to let all the gas out in the
reserve<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.219> also<00:00:35.460> works<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
reserve but that one also works off the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.869 
reserve but that one also works off the
vacuum<00:00:36.300> line<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> prime<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.430> free<00:00:38.640> flowing

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
vacuum line so the prime is free flowing

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.000 
vacuum line so the prime is free flowing
all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> time<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.590> want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
all the time you don't want to use that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
all the time you don't want to use that
when<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.579> running<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.809> motorcycle<00:00:43.410> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
when you're running the motorcycle just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
when you're running the motorcycle just
to<00:00:44.010> fill<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.309> bowls<00:00:44.750> if<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.870> haven't

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to fill your bowls if you haven't

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750 
to fill your bowls if you haven't
started<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> while<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.640> my

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
started it for a while it's my

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.630 
started it for a while it's my
motorcycles<00:00:48.390> away<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.460> isn't

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
motorcycles away right now so this isn't

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
motorcycles away right now so this isn't
going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> great<00:00:51.270> video<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.710> still

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
going to be a great video but we still

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
going to be a great video but we still
know<00:00:53.129> where<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.430> lines<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.170> then

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
know where your lines are going then

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
know where your lines are going then
there<00:00:55.350> there's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> line<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> middle<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
there there's a line in the middle of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.819 
there there's a line in the middle of
the<00:00:57.030> tank<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.750> goes<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> it's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the tank that just goes down and it's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.319 
the tank that just goes down and it's
like<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> overflow<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:01.109> these<00:01:01.350> other<00:01:01.559> lines

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
like a overflow like these other lines

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
like a overflow like these other lines
coming<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> bottom<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> bowls<00:01:04.409> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
coming off the bottom of the bowls so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.030 
coming off the bottom of the bowls so
that<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:06.000> coming<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.650> middle<00:01:07.920> up

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that one coming out of the middle up

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
that one coming out of the middle up
here<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.479> extra<00:01:09.689> tank<00:01:09.960> over<00:01:10.200> here

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
here and I got an extra tank over here

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:28.500 
here and I got an extra tank over here
let's<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:13.100> can't<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.250> through<00:01:15.619> hold<00:01:16.619> on

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.170 

no<00:01:29.510> that<00:01:29.780> one<00:01:29.930> doesn't<00:01:30.110> have<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:31.000> alright<00:01:32.000> so

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
no that one doesn't have it alright so

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.790 
no that one doesn't have it alright so
anyways<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.979> fuel<00:01:37.220> line<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:39.020> big<00:01:39.229> one<00:01:39.440> I'm

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
anyways so the fuel line the big one I'm

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.410 
anyways so the fuel line the big one I'm
sure<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.729> know<00:01:40.910> where<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.210> one<00:01:41.390> goes

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
sure you you know where that one goes

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.350 
sure you you know where that one goes
the<00:01:42.380> problem<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.830> vacuum<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:44.090> found

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the problem is a vacuum one and I found

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.080 
the problem is a vacuum one and I found
this<00:01:44.479> out<00:01:44.660> myself<00:01:45.460> see<00:01:46.460> all<00:01:46.580> these<00:01:46.790> lines

this out myself see all these lines

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.360 
this out myself see all these lines

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
coming out of the carburetors are just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:58.090 
coming out of the carburetors are just

right one or not because there's so many
here's<00:02:28.700> another<00:02:28.940> one<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:29.330> that's<00:02:29.420> overflow

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
here's another one but that's overflow

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.300 
here's another one but that's overflow
that's<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.030> one<00:02:32.180> for<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.570> vacuum<00:02:32.870> line<00:02:33.320> you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
that's the one for the vacuum line you

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.190 
that's the one for the vacuum line you
can<00:02:34.489> start<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.180> prime<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.049> can

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
can start it up in prime and you can

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.930 
can start it up in prime and you can
stick<00:02:36.440> your<00:02:36.470> fingers<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.100> these<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.700> one

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
stick your fingers on these and that one

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.370 
stick your fingers on these and that one
will<00:02:38.090> have<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.239> little<00:02:38.510> suction<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
will have a little suction to it and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.759 
will have a little suction to it and
what<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.130> basically<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> fuel<00:02:41.090> pump

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
what it is is basically like a fuel pump

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.610 
what it is is basically like a fuel pump
so<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.799> one<00:02:43.130> right<00:02:43.340> there<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:44.230> your<00:02:45.230> vacuum

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
so that one right there is your vacuum

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.410 
so that one right there is your vacuum
line<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:48.489> will<00:02:49.489> let<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.760> run<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.299> on

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
line and that will let you run in the on

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.660 
line and that will let you run in the on
position<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:51.140> get<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.950> right<00:02:52.130> amount<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.489> gas

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
position and get the right amount of gas

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.780 
position and get the right amount of gas
all<00:02:53.660> right
