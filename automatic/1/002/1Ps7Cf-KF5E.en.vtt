started<00:00:33.559> here<00:00:33.770> basically<00:00:34.489> all<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.120> do<00:00:35.300> is

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
started here basically all you do is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.229 
started here basically all you do is
dive<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.350> sack<00:00:36.590> bounce<00:00:36.890> for<00:00:37.339> sorry<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.059> sack

dive the sack bounce for sorry the sack

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.599 
dive the sack bounce for sorry the sack
pots<00:00:38.510> from<00:00:38.960> one<00:00:39.499> side<00:00:39.769> of<00:00:39.800> about<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.460> other

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
pots from one side of about the other

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.660 
pots from one side of about the other
pretty<00:00:41.569> straightforward<00:00:42.379> however<00:00:43.280> what's

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
pretty straightforward however what's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.439 
pretty straightforward however what's
not<00:00:43.850> straightforward<00:00:44.179> is<00:00:45.219> how<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.280> get<00:00:47.089> the

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
not straightforward is how you get the

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.360 
not straightforward is how you get the
high<00:00:47.569> score<00:00:47.600> needed<00:00:48.019> for<00:00:48.229> the<00:00:48.319> bubbles<00:00:48.620> so

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
high score needed for the bubbles so

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.969 
high score needed for the bubbles so
this<00:00:49.969> duffel<00:00:51.429> can<00:00:52.429> require<00:00:52.819> a<00:00:53.179> lot<00:00:53.420> of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
this duffel can require a lot of

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.289 
this duffel can require a lot of
multitasking<00:00:54.979> well<00:00:55.549> it<00:00:55.609> does<00:00:55.789> require<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.149> lot

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
multitasking well it does require a lot

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.049 
multitasking well it does require a lot
of<00:00:56.359> multitaskers<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.319> also<00:00:58.159> requires<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.609> lot

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
of multitaskers and also requires a lot

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.360 
of multitaskers and also requires a lot
of<00:00:59.239> quick<00:00:59.510> thinking<00:00:59.839> so<00:01:00.530> as<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:00.769> can<00:01:00.949> see<00:01:01.010> here

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
of quick thinking so as you can see here

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.039 
of quick thinking so as you can see here
they're<00:01:01.579> already<00:01:01.789> throwing<00:01:02.120> multiple<00:01:02.690> stack

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
they're already throwing multiple stack

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.120 
they're already throwing multiple stack
pots<00:01:03.319> at<00:01:03.530> me<00:01:05.290> basically<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.619> buffers<00:01:06.979> are

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
pots at me basically the buffers are

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.880 
pots at me basically the buffers are
each<00:01:07.340> confined<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.119> a<00:01:08.150> certain<00:01:08.360> area<00:01:08.890> where

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
each confined to a certain area where

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.800 
each confined to a certain area where
it's<00:01:10.250> only<00:01:10.460> area<00:01:10.910> that<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.150> can<00:01:11.300> hit<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.630> sack

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
it's only area that you can hit the sack

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.300 
it's only area that you can hit the sack
clocks<00:01:12.080> due<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.530> limited<00:01:12.830> space<00:01:12.980> where

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
clocks due to the limited space where

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.800 
clocks due to the limited space where
you<00:01:13.370> can<00:01:13.520> move<00:01:14.150> back<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.390> forth<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:17.510> biggest

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
you can move back and forth the biggest

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.410 
you can move back and forth the biggest
technique<00:01:18.200> for<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.790> if<00:01:19.790> just<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.240> keep

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
technique for this if just to keep

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.590 
technique for this if just to keep
focusing<00:01:21.010> keep<00:01:22.010> changing<00:01:22.580> your<00:01:22.730> focus<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.510> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
focusing keep changing your focus to the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.330 
focusing keep changing your focus to the
first<00:01:23.900> step<00:01:24.140> pot<00:01:24.410> in<00:01:24.680> front<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:24.980> you<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.160> them

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
first step pot in front of you of them

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.610 
first step pot in front of you of them
and<00:01:25.580> just<00:01:26.300> like<00:01:26.420> I'm<00:01:26.570> doing<00:01:26.840> just<00:01:26.990> like<00:01:27.170> that

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
and just like I'm doing just like that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.160 
and just like I'm doing just like that
and<00:01:28.010> it<00:01:28.130> makes<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.370> extremely<00:01:28.550> easy<00:01:29.050> until<00:01:30.050> you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
and it makes it extremely easy until you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.810 
and it makes it extremely easy until you
get<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.530> realm<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:31.220> where<00:01:31.550> they<00:01:31.640> all

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
get to the realm here where they all

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.290 
get to the realm here where they all
come<00:01:32.030> out<00:01:32.120> simultaneously<00:01:33.790> what<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:34.820> would<00:01:35.060> do

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
come out simultaneously what I would do

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.590 
come out simultaneously what I would do
is<00:01:35.570> kind<00:01:36.080> of<00:01:36.230> zoom<00:01:36.770> out<00:01:36.920> your<00:01:37.130> vision<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.700> just

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
is kind of zoom out your vision and just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.390 
is kind of zoom out your vision and just
try<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.410> match<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:41.020> three<00:01:42.020> green<00:01:42.290> lines<00:01:42.650> those

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
try to match the three green lines those

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.960 
try to match the three green lines those
spotlights<00:01:43.850> with<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.100> other<00:01:46.100> side<00:01:46.400> box<00:01:46.670> this

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
spotlights with the other side box this

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.820 
spotlights with the other side box this
parts<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.300> hardest<00:01:47.630> one<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.290> I'm<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:48.440> kind

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
parts the hardest one so I'm just kind

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.620 
parts the hardest one so I'm just kind
of<00:01:48.890> zooming<00:01:49.100> up<00:01:49.280> my<00:01:49.460> vision<00:01:49.640> here<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.210> have

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
of zooming up my vision here I have

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.800 
of zooming up my vision here I have
messed<00:01:50.810> up<00:01:50.930> at<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.260> corner

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
messed up at that corner

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.140 
messed up at that corner
they<00:01:52.260> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.650> zooming<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.640> vision

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
they kind of just zooming up my vision

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.560 
they kind of just zooming up my vision
and<00:01:55.130> trying<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.190> match<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.820> green<00:01:57.030> lines<00:01:57.330> with

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and trying to match the green lines with

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
and trying to match the green lines with
the<00:01:57.660> SAC<00:01:57.870> watts<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.190> pretty<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the SAC watts that was pretty much the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.990 
the SAC watts that was pretty much the
hardest<00:02:00.120> part<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.140> level<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.340> did

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
hardest part of the level there I did

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
hardest part of the level there I did
get<00:02:03.120> it<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.990> first<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.410> but<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:04.740> did<00:02:04.890> miss<00:02:05.040> up

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
get it the first time but I did miss up
