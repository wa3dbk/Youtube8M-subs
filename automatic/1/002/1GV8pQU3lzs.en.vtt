00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
fine and if you have a softer one you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.420 
fine and if you have a softer one you
definitely<00:03:13.019> use<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.350> spoon<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.250> said

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
definitely use a spoon like I said

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.250 
definitely use a spoon like I said
before<00:03:14.580> don't<00:03:14.760> use<00:03:15.060> an<00:03:15.180> avocado<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.870> too

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
before don't use an avocado that is too

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.539 
before don't use an avocado that is too
terribly<00:03:16.769> ripe<00:03:16.980> because<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:17.400> you're<00:03:17.489> just

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
terribly ripe because then you're just

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.280 
terribly ripe because then you're just
gonna<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> mushy<00:03:18.120> advocaat<00:03:18.570> oh<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.900> it's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
gonna have a mushy advocaat oh and it's

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.750 
gonna have a mushy advocaat oh and it's
not<00:03:19.440> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.650> keep<00:03:19.769> its<00:03:19.950> shape<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.640> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
not going to keep its shape when you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.280 
not going to keep its shape when you
start<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.060> stir<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.480> mixture<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:22.140> it's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
start to stir this mixture because it's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.070 
start to stir this mixture because it's
actually<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.860> pretty<00:03:23.040> heavy<00:03:23.160> mixture<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.989> now

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
actually a pretty heavy mixture so now

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.780 
actually a pretty heavy mixture so now
you're<00:03:25.200> gonna<00:03:25.290> cut<00:03:25.560> your<00:03:25.650> tomatoes<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.310> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you're gonna cut your tomatoes and I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.699 
you're gonna cut your tomatoes and I
just<00:03:27.060> make<00:03:27.330> sure<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.600> cut<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> tops<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.560> them

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
just make sure you cut the tops of them

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.770 
just make sure you cut the tops of them
off<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:29.700> when<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> slice<00:03:30.209> them<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.630> just

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
off and then when I slice them I just

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.780 
off and then when I slice them I just
lay<00:03:31.350> them<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.590> flat<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.100> board<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:32.760> I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
lay them on flat on the board and then I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.509 
lay them on flat on the board and then I
sliced<00:03:33.299> them<00:03:33.480> lengthwise<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.130> start

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
sliced them lengthwise and then I start

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.069 
sliced them lengthwise and then I start
to<00:03:35.640> dice<00:03:35.820> them<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.269> then<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.510> creates<00:03:36.900> those

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
to dice them and then that creates those

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.740 
to dice them and then that creates those
nice<00:03:37.380> little<00:03:37.620> square<00:03:38.400> dices<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.600> cut

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
nice little square dices you can cut

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.539 
nice little square dices you can cut
them<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.049> small<00:03:40.200> or<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.560> big<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.130> want<00:03:41.340> I

kind of like to put everything in this

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800 
kind of like to put everything in this
recipe<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:44.459> got<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.360> make<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.660> same

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
recipe I got like to make it the same

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.390 
recipe I got like to make it the same
size<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.470> you're<00:03:46.590> getting<00:03:46.799> kind<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
size so that you're getting kind of a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.590 
size so that you're getting kind of a
little<00:03:47.670> bit<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.910> everything<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.510> each

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
little bit of everything in each

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.690 
little bit of everything in each
mouthful<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.410> totally<00:03:49.590> depends<00:03:50.070> on<00:03:50.100> what

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
mouthful but it totally depends on what

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.430 
mouthful but it totally depends on what

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
you can definitely do that and don't be

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.360 
you can definitely do that and don't be
afraid<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.780> add<00:03:55.260> new<00:03:55.530> things<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:56.130> try

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
afraid to add new things to try

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.220 
afraid to add new things to try

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
these tomatoes because I don't like my

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.900

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
if you want to next I'm gonna take a

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.240 
if you want to next I'm gonna take a
bunch<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.960> cilantro<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:17.070> is

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
bunch of the cilantro and this is

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.490 
bunch of the cilantro and this is
totally<00:04:17.850> up<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.239> your<00:04:18.360> personal<00:04:18.600> taste<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.230> just

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
totally up to your personal taste I just

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.370 
totally up to your personal taste I just
kind<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.739> pluck<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.130> bunch<00:04:20.430> off<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.930> don't

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
kind of pluck a bunch off and I don't

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.140 
kind of pluck a bunch off and I don't
really<00:04:22.590> measure<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.100> but<00:04:23.490> make<00:04:23.670> sure<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.910> chop

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
really measure it but make sure you chop

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.790 
really measure it but make sure you chop
it<00:04:24.330> really<00:04:24.660> finely<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.290> you're<00:04:25.440> not<00:04:25.560> getting

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
it really finely so you're not getting

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.040 
it really finely so you're not getting
huge<00:04:26.220> chunks<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.850> cilantro<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.900> can

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
huge chunks of that cilantro and you can

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.690 
huge chunks of that cilantro and you can
also<00:04:28.200> chop<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.650> stems<00:04:28.770> as<00:04:29.100> well<00:04:29.250> they<00:04:29.460> tend<00:04:29.610> to

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
also chop the stems as well they tend to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.490 
also chop the stems as well they tend to
be<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.850> little<00:04:29.970> bit<00:04:30.180> stronger<00:04:30.450> in<00:04:30.540> flavor<00:04:30.720> but

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
be a little bit stronger in flavor but

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.100 
be a little bit stronger in flavor but
it<00:04:31.560> totally<00:04:31.770> depends<00:04:32.100> on<00:04:32.280> your<00:04:32.700> taste<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:34.020> then

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
it totally depends on your taste so then

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.140 
it totally depends on your taste so then
I'm<00:04:34.170> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.320> add<00:04:34.440> both<00:04:35.070> cans<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.580> beans<00:04:35.760> make

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
I'm going to add both cans of beans make

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.970 
I'm going to add both cans of beans make
sure<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.480> rinse<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.020> drain<00:04:37.440> them<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:37.830> you

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.880 
garlic in this it's really kind of
jarring<00:05:51.300> when<00:05:51.510> you<00:05:51.570> have<00:05:51.750> raw<00:05:52.380> chunks<00:05:52.770> of

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890

jarring when you have raw chunks of
garlic<00:05:53.160> in<00:05:53.280> something<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:53.970> definitely<00:05:54.390> use<00:05:54.600> a

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
garlic in something so definitely use a

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.300

but<00:05:58.260> they<00:05:58.380> make<00:05:58.560> all<00:05:58.860> of<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.490> difference<00:05:59.820> in

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
but they make all of the difference in

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.090 
but they make all of the difference in
dressings<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.200> then<00:06:01.740> you're<00:06:01.830> gonna<00:06:01.950> use<00:06:02.070> a

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
dressings and then you're gonna use a

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.560 
dressings and then you're gonna use a
little<00:06:02.340> bit<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.550> chili<00:06:02.729> powder<00:06:02.820> I'd<00:06:03.270> say<00:06:03.390> maybe

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
little bit of chili powder I'd say maybe

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.300 
little bit of chili powder I'd say maybe
like<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.810> half<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.229> teaspoon<00:06:04.410> but<00:06:04.890> if<00:06:05.010> you<00:06:05.130> like

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
like a half a teaspoon but if you like

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.730 
like a half a teaspoon but if you like
it<00:06:05.460> spicier<00:06:05.970> definitely<00:06:06.750> is<00:06:06.870> more<00:06:07.080> like<00:06:07.650> I

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
it spicier definitely is more like I

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.440 
it spicier definitely is more like I
said<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:07.979> can<00:06:08.130> also<00:06:08.280> use<00:06:08.520> fresh<00:06:08.880> chilies<00:06:09.330> or

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
said you can also use fresh chilies or

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.719 
said you can also use fresh chilies or
jalapenos<00:06:09.930> if<00:06:10.110> you<00:06:10.200> want<00:06:10.410> and<00:06:10.650> then<00:06:11.220> about<00:06:11.550> the

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
jalapenos if you want and then about the

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.400 
jalapenos if you want and then about the
same<00:06:11.760> amount<00:06:12.150> of<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.390> cumin<00:06:12.750> as<00:06:12.900> well<00:06:13.110> and

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
same amount of the cumin as well and

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.650 
same amount of the cumin as well and

with the spices just kind of do it to
taste<00:06:15.870> if<00:06:16.140> you<00:06:16.169> like<00:06:16.410> a<00:06:16.560> spicier<00:06:17.100> dressing

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
taste if you like a spicier dressing

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.020 
taste if you like a spicier dressing

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
delicious and then I'm just using a

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.370 
delicious and then I'm just using a
little<00:06:44.760> bit<00:06:44.880> of<00:06:45.030> sea<00:06:45.270> salt<00:06:45.479> and<00:06:45.750> this<00:06:46.199> is

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
little bit of sea salt and this is

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.870 
little bit of sea salt and this is
another<00:06:46.560> thing<00:06:46.800> to<00:06:46.979> taste<00:06:47.220> if<00:06:47.460> you<00:06:47.550> don't<00:06:47.760> like

another thing to taste if you don't like

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.580 
another thing to taste if you don't like
salty<00:06:48.240> you<00:06:48.449> don't<00:06:48.660> have<00:06:48.780> to<00:06:48.900> even<00:06:49.110> use<00:06:49.229> salt<00:06:49.470> if

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
salty you don't have to even use salt if

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.020 
salty you don't have to even use salt if
you<00:06:49.650> don't<00:06:49.860> want<00:06:49.979> to<00:06:50.100> but<00:06:50.280> the<00:06:50.430> salt<00:06:50.639> really

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
you don't want to but the salt really

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.580 
you don't want to but the salt really
does<00:06:51.180> bring<00:06:51.479> the<00:06:51.960> flavor<00:06:52.199> out<00:06:52.289> of<00:06:52.530> those

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
does bring the flavor out of those

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.469 
does bring the flavor out of those
vegetables<00:06:53.130> so<00:06:53.250> I<00:06:53.280> suggest<00:06:53.789> using<00:06:54.090> at<00:06:54.180> least<00:06:54.360> a

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
vegetables so I suggest using at least a

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.170 
vegetables so I suggest using at least a
little<00:06:54.780> bit<00:06:54.930> of<00:06:55.050> salt<00:06:55.260> and<00:06:55.440> sea<00:06:56.010> salt<00:06:56.190> is<00:06:56.460> a<00:06:56.789> lot

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
little bit of salt and sea salt is a lot

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.640 
little bit of salt and sea salt is a lot
better<00:06:57.300> than<00:06:57.419> normal<00:06:57.870> salt<00:06:58.020> just<00:06:58.139> taste<00:06:58.410> wise

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
better than normal salt just taste wise
