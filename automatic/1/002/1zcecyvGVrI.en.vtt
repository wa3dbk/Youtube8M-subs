00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.950
 So he began today had to change his defense for he could 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.080
 The home advantage includes a downpour an hour before the game 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.160
 even the case is the coach 18 this was the game from the beginning 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.390
 played this wish and fight 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.900
 after only three minutes, the situation turned into a first victim, so to speak 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.789
 Defender Safari Franz himself in pain the taz was at the end of a run 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.119
 Tourists stopped the trapps banks were left after three minutes was the game 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.020
 for Safari 4 1 2 0 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.830
 Paul came to the shaft for him, he served the same Shaqiri here 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.580
 on the 4th 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.670
 and Streller you can speak a title 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.120
 the two teams did not give anything and tried out of the precarious 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.560
 Conditions just to make the best possible 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.300
 After Barcelona managed to bring her a playful touch in the encounter too 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.050
 bring 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.500
 Stockholm 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.360
 free 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.810
 as always, deleting the 1 0 for FC Barcelona 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 in the 14 10th 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.050
 for one over the Arnsberger Thun sda at noon coldness bismuth the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.909
 scores 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.909
 Championship round Mater available for Alex 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.810
 it was continued to fight by all means on the way to the 18th 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 and I thought that beyond the loser were the longest of mine 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.010
 scored little chances 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.250
 After working, Assange said 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.660
 there were arrests 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.180
 to solve quickly 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
 the next launches are 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.710
 Valentin Stocker Woe if he let go then he stopped alone against 4 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.510
 Watch finally warned 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 dedicated to these questions 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.740
 Of course, Stocker was clear 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.910
 she does not dive for fcb-trainer Fink 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.550
 for the neutral observer but you can not referee like 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.550
 Bieri at least understandable 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:19.579
 min relief free kick for goalie Costanzo across the field the deliverers 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.679
 Strehle 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.959
 Kirchner became it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 we were 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.870
 After a break and the time of Hakan Yakin today, nothing was planned 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.019
 found 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 but where are only the people 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.350
 the new route 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.159
 There are many at the dax booth here 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.049
 you actually had to 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.049
 Asheton is dead 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.429
 Stocker 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.229
 Orban said he had enjoyed the race nativity set 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:00.389
 after an hour changed, however, finds him with a forced touch 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.849
 despite all this first healed hamstring in front but at the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.559
 Lucerne just did not even run 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.300
 then a free kick by Cerci 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.059
 Miguel Ferrer through 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.199
 Aleks could have freely vaccinated this ball still tap 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.019
 the Lucerne had to act in the attack 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.059
 "It would be sooner 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.059
 Courson dances on 4g Garden's Taiwan 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.649
 PUG done 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.789
 and there, the ball was just past its own goal 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.459
 again the duel goes the post office 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.459
 an SUV itself Thun remained and the budding in the offside no gate 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.319
 also a warning shot the FCB had the game 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.169
 although in Geneva he added but only back with 1 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.349
 Croatia here in the offside 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
 another quarter of an hour 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.689
 it'll be around 70 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.209
 that was actually the biggest scoring chance of the FC Luzern ever 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.479
 in the first 75 games 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.619
 this tune did not miss the goal 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.379
 Heiner Krämer had to be followed 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.379
 9 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900
 the nose but still a little more purposeful 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.590
 the three just faster 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.499
 we players 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.499
 he did not come over 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:57.009
 so she was always trying so let the most dangerous it was 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.009
 but only at this rounding of approx 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.879
 the numbers speak 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.069
 the markets would have to 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.719
 the media 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.249
 Wanka 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.270
 the Sams 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.189
 great scoring chance followed by painful and open 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.249
 and the ghosts with the goalkeeper closing the Lucerne they are nocturnal animals 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.699
 the equalizer but not more 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.699
 Basel won Mainz 10 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.980
 this was an end to Rudolf Baumann and why October 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.490
 Percent lost the regulation of the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.840
 For several years, of course, our goal is that the coach education 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.020
 of the game had to 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.400
 this one up to the lead 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.199
 the latter worry that 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.840
 even before it is very quiet and makes at the end of May create for selected 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.589
 He should take care of his Sozia residents in Zion and Rosé again 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:59.309
 print 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:04.289
 difficult Stettler been the reason that what glares Hellas but slower 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.559
 back 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.900
 Lucerne's high altitude flight ended today 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.469
 the power
