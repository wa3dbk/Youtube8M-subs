pack<00:03:13.110> had<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> little<00:03:13.680> bit<00:03:13.890> more<00:03:14.069> stuff<00:03:14.430> inside

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.300 
pack had a little bit more stuff inside
of<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.209> maybe<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.080> new<00:03:16.319> game<00:03:16.620> types<00:03:16.980> such<00:03:17.280> as

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
of it maybe like new game types such as

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.729 
of it maybe like new game types such as
global<00:03:17.819> thermonuclear<00:03:18.180> war<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:19.170> right<00:03:19.560> now

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
global thermonuclear war and right now

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.080 
global thermonuclear war and right now
it<00:03:19.890> looks<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.159> there's<00:03:20.430> nothing<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:20.909> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
