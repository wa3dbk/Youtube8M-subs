00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.890
 Hello 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.090
 and how can they give us 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.680
 The only thing we are going to need is a 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.680
 sweater ready little buttons 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 well we are passing our other 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.840
 as we create the super stay 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.040
 nice I hope you like it very much felt 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.040
 same has the arms 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.440
 how are we 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.230
 ah 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.210
 now we are going to start and first thing 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.870
 that to use is a needle but such 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.320
 width 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.210
 we need a common needle 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.430
 the second is a thread of the color of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.440
 Our sweater has to be identical or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.690
 similar to our dream 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.510
 a pair of scissors to cut that thread 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.060
 leftover that can help us 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.920
 and one like little buttons I really did not know 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.650
 what they are called but unlike the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.720
 buttons have very separated eyes 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 so you can say there in any 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.659
 haberdashery or jewelry any of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.960
 his two stores then built 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.850
 a pencil or a pen in my case used 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.100
 a pencil but it did not work for me and I used a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.860
 loose 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.010
 and of course the ready sweater or the one that we are going to 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.200
 separate from the flower 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.390
 ok let's put our shooter in a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.190
 flat surface and let's start 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.710
 place our dots in the way 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 that you want to put them as you want 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 we want one by one and we place them in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.060
 the way you do 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.700
 yes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.200
 already when they're all ready we're going to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.870
 use our the python our pen 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.330
 to mark them in the sweet airs in this 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 case is used is from the track really 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.280
 he did not get up and he suffers a pen to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.470
 mark them well and put in a point 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.470
 where will each button go so as not to lose 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.580
 if you can take a picture for 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.950
 remember where the figures were going 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.600
 they do not take our thread we are going to take it out 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.450
 a little part that you believe 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.450
 convenient and we're going to cut it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.040
 let's take our needle and our and 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.409
 we were going to go through the lid more 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.680
 stressful that is to place the thread 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.140
 inside the hole of the needle we are going to 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.549
 see a little but we will be able to 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.290
 achieve it later we are going to gather the 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.209
 last two parts of ours and the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.280
 we're going to give him a minute so he does not 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.420
 I was hiding in half to start 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.420
 put on the sweater 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.690
 returning the sweater we will apply 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.819
 all our little buttons that we had 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.629
 posts and we're going to work with the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:46.840
 first just for this we are going to 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.450
 pass the needle through the sweater and 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.010
 let's go through the first hole in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.290
 our button as you are seeing it 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.750
 right now the image does not stretch until 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.049
 stop the sweater with him with the knot that 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.410
 we have done we lowered our little button and 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:06.099
 from there we are going to place another one of the needle 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.079
 but above the button how are you 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.099
 seeing right now we went through there and 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.099
 we down the ouija 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.030
 now for the back we're going to 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.520
 can put the needle and we're going to 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.440
 to transfer the other Egypt now back 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.199
 forwards if I do not like to spend the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.630
 needle in front of the button to 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.930
 adjust it as our children and lieutenant 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.389
 and we are going to capture behind the surplus that 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.150
 let's have it there that 's very good we're not going 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.320
 to place the other piece is as it should be 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.320
 stay ok 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.139
 the other piece and we're not going to place in 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.479
 auction we publish in the first piece 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.139
 nor use it with all the pieces of 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.139
 our 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.860
 the truth I do not know what happened with the last 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.440
 part of the video but good is the last 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.970
 part is the rivet or by mudito 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.470
 back when I put almost all the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.479
 parties that will go for the part of 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.400
 back of the sweater and you're going to start going 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.500
 the needle by the sweater making a 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.380
 nudity so that all the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.120
 pieces there is 77 difficulty this be 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.370
 conscious all that you can buy 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.139
 glue for fabric and just paste 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.690
 the pieces and that's the end result 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.020
 of our sweater that is beautiful 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.970
 the truth 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.060
 I hope you liked this guy in why 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.729
 As you can see it's something super simple and you can 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.379
 Remove all the ones you have there or the 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.750
 that are economical or in any 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.750
 store placing him another nine pistons 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.980
 but the next video is very good 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.809
 and see you until next time 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.950
