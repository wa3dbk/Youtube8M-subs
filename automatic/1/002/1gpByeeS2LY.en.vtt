they make a chain it looks like a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.240 
they make a chain it looks like a
crochet<00:01:35.490> chain<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:37.200> another<00:01:37.439> video<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.860> have

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
crochet chain in another video I have

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
crochet chain in another video I have
shown<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> crochet<00:01:39.090> cast<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
shown it as the crochet cast on but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.730 
shown it as the crochet cast on but
that's<00:01:40.259> erroneous<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:42.240> correct<00:01:42.740> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's erroneous that's not correct so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.649 
that's erroneous that's not correct so
we're<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> crochet<00:01:45.119> chain<00:01:45.180> on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
we're going to have a crochet chain on

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
we're going to have a crochet chain on
it<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.649> called<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it but it's actually just called the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.420 
it but it's actually just called the
chain<00:01:47.939> cast<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> continue

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
chain cast on so we're going to continue

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.710 
chain cast on so we're going to continue
in<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.420> way<00:01:51.860> across<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.479> would

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
in this way across and then you would

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.770 
in this way across and then you would
connect<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.500> making<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> round

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
connect if you're making it in the round

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.429 
connect if you're making it in the round
or<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.329> end<00:02:00.540> when

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
or you would put it on the end when

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.819 
or you would put it on the end when
you're<00:02:01.590> finished<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:04.110> you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you're finished just like that if you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
you're finished just like that if you
decide<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.369> need<00:02:05.520> an<00:02:05.700> extra<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.869> need

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
