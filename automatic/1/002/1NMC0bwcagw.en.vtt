00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.740 
problem we had to go through the 82-game
season<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.730> we<00:04:25.880> went<00:04:26.060> through<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.390> maybe<00:04:26.660> a

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
season and we went through that maybe a

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.810 
season and we went through that maybe a
little<00:04:26.900> lackluster<00:04:27.140> or<00:04:27.710> mentally<00:04:28.490> draining

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
little lackluster or mentally draining

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.630 
little lackluster or mentally draining
but<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:30.080> think<00:04:30.350> we<00:04:30.530> are<00:04:30.710> pretty<00:04:30.980> much<00:04:31.070> motivated

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
but I think we are pretty much motivated

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.390 
but I think we are pretty much motivated
with<00:04:32.180> being<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.720> underdog<00:04:33.110> it's<00:04:33.890> not<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.130> bad

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
with being the underdog it's not a bad

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.830 
with being the underdog it's not a bad
position<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.850> be<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.180> think<00:04:35.390> this<00:04:35.510> team<00:04:35.690> is

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
position to be and I think this team is

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.659 
position to be and I think this team is
willing<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.140> accept<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:37.220> take<00:04:37.400> some<00:04:37.580> of

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
willing to accept that and take some of

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.950 
willing to accept that and take some of
the<00:04:37.760> pressure<00:04:37.850> off<00:04:38.120> try<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.480> do<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.780> for<00:04:38.900> the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
the pressure off try to do it for the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.260 
the pressure off try to do it for the
third<00:04:39.140> time<00:04:39.169> like<00:04:39.830> really<00:04:40.190> surprised<00:04:40.760> tonight

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
third time like really surprised tonight

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.800 
third time like really surprised tonight
by<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.900> ease<00:04:42.320> of<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.250> dominant<00:04:43.910> on<00:04:44.300> your

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
by the ease of the dominant on your

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.870 
by the ease of the dominant on your
offer<00:04:44.990> and<00:04:45.169> support<00:04:45.650> yeah<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:46.700> were<00:04:46.760> very

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
offer and support yeah we were very

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.719 
offer and support yeah we were very
surprised<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:49.100> adjustments<00:04:49.640> by

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
surprised and I think the adjustments by

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.880 
surprised and I think the adjustments by
Atlanta<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:50.270> gonna<00:04:50.360> be<00:04:50.600> shown<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.260> probably

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
them by surprise with the active defense

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.860 
them by surprise with the active defense
and<00:04:55.130> an<00:04:55.400> offensive<00:04:55.760> rebounding<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.540> we<00:04:56.630> did
