00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
pronounce this right why Pak FA t-50 it

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.179 
pronounce this right why Pak FA t-50 it
is<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.060> Russian<00:00:23.390> stealth<00:00:23.900> fighter<00:00:24.289> I<00:00:24.679> don't

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
is a Russian stealth fighter I don't

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.249 
is a Russian stealth fighter I don't
know<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.339> lot<00:00:25.519> about<00:00:25.669> the<00:00:25.970> Russian<00:00:26.929> fighters

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
know a lot about the Russian fighters

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.109 
know a lot about the Russian fighters
but<00:00:27.470> apparently<00:00:27.949> this<00:00:28.159> replaces<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.880> meg

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
but apparently this replaces the meg

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.450 
but apparently this replaces the meg
anyways<00:00:29.929> this<00:00:30.109> was<00:00:30.319> highly<00:00:30.619> requested<00:00:30.769> on<00:00:31.249> my

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
anyways this was highly requested on my

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.189 
anyways this was highly requested on my
request<00:00:31.819> video<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:32.329> I<00:00:32.359> went<00:00:32.539> ahead<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.019> made

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
request video so I went ahead and made

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.080 
request video so I went ahead and made
one<00:00:33.469> alright<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:34.579> is<00:00:34.730> what<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.940> looks

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
one alright so this is what it looks

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.420 
one alright so this is what it looks
like<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.539> ground<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.199> this<00:00:37.070> is<00:00:37.190> in<00:00:37.340> a

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
like on the ground and this is in a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.610 
like on the ground and this is in a
white<00:00:37.640> quartz<00:00:38.090> version<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.690> again<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:39.260> idea

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
white quartz version and again the idea

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.290 
white quartz version and again the idea
is<00:00:39.679> to<00:00:39.859> get<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.100> pattern<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:40.609> then<00:00:41.059> hopefully

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
is to get the pattern and then hopefully

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.849 
is to get the pattern and then hopefully
in<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.660> future<00:00:41.809> when<00:00:42.079> minecraft<00:00:42.530> gives<00:00:42.739> us

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
in the future when minecraft gives us

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.020 
in the future when minecraft gives us
some<00:00:43.039> different<00:00:43.160> blocks<00:00:43.519> to<00:00:43.670> work<00:00:43.820> with

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
some different blocks to work with

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.110 
some different blocks to work with
hopefully<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:45.199> slabs<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.739> wool<00:00:45.980> we<00:00:46.789> can<00:00:46.969> make

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
hopefully the slabs of wool we can make

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.419 
hopefully the slabs of wool we can make
it<00:00:47.300> in<00:00:47.420> different<00:00:47.600> variances<00:00:48.289> of<00:00:48.530> light<00:00:49.219> gray

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
it in different variances of light gray

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.819 
it in different variances of light gray
and<00:00:49.460> dark<00:00:49.820> grey<00:00:50.059> this<00:00:50.480> is<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.690> custom<00:00:51.469> texture

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
and dark grey this is a custom texture

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.040 
and dark grey this is a custom texture
pack<00:00:52.039> that's<00:00:52.940> why<00:00:53.120> this<00:00:53.179> one<00:00:53.449> is<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.690> matte<00:00:53.929> dark

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
pack that's why this one is a matte dark

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.619 
pack that's why this one is a matte dark
gray<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:55.399> flying<00:00:55.820> in<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.179> air<00:00:56.329> so

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
gray and this is it flying in the air so

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.669 
gray and this is it flying in the air so
this<00:00:56.749> is<00:00:56.809> what<00:00:56.929> we're<00:00:57.019> gonna<00:00:57.079> be<00:00:57.199> making<00:00:57.289> guys

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
this is what we're gonna be making guys

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.529 
this is what we're gonna be making guys
should<00:00:57.980> be<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.129> super<00:00:58.519> super<00:00:58.789> easy<00:00:58.909> build<00:00:59.300> and

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
should be a super super easy build and

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.349 
should be a super super easy build and
let's<00:01:00.379> drop<00:01:00.710> over<00:01:01.100> here<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:01.579> we<00:01:01.760> are<00:01:01.789> going<00:01:02.239> to

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
let's drop over here and we are going to
