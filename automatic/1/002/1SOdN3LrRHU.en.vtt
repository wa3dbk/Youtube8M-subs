here's<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.760> airlift<00:00:02.760> demo<00:00:02.970> for<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.259> window

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
here's my airlift demo for the window

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.169 
here's my airlift demo for the window
farms<00:00:04.920> project<00:00:06.290> which<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.529> see<00:00:07.560> at<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
farms project which you can see at the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.390 
farms project which you can see at the
address<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:10.429> details<00:00:12.440> anyway<00:00:14.059> we've<00:00:15.059> got

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
address in the details anyway we've got

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.790 
address in the details anyway we've got
20<00:00:17.400> inches<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.910> submergence<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.590> see

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
20 inches of submergence and you can see

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.750 
20 inches of submergence and you can see
the<00:00:19.920> speed<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.369> water<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> water

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the speed of the water there so water

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.009 
the speed of the water there so water
coming<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.980> goes<00:00:25.980> down<00:00:26.220> through<00:00:26.990> three<00:00:27.990> of

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
coming up goes down through three of

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.030 
coming up goes down through three of
these<00:00:28.199> large<00:00:28.500> bottles<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:30.560> down<00:00:31.560> into<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
these large bottles and down into the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.200 
these large bottles and down into the
reservoir<00:00:32.600> for<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> reservoir<00:00:34.280> has<00:00:35.280> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
reservoir for the reservoir has it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
reservoir for the reservoir has it's
just<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.870> guess<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> sauce<00:00:37.559> bottle<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> has<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
just I guess a sauce bottle and it has a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.209 
just I guess a sauce bottle and it has a
little<00:00:42.860> top<00:00:43.860> honest<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.030> goes<00:00:45.270> down

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
little top honest and this goes down

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.880 
little top honest and this goes down
rounding<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> curve<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.559> 20

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
rounding a curve and this is it's at 20

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.389 
rounding a curve and this is it's at 20
inches<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.050> where<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.800> air<00:00:53.100> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
inches now and this is where the air is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
inches now and this is where the air is
pulled<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.039> then<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.840> airlift

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pulled in and then you see the airlift

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.310 
pulled in and then you see the airlift
plus<00:00:58.469> has<00:00:58.680> taken<00:00:59.010> place<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:02.960> water<00:01:03.960> goes<00:01:04.290> up

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
plus has taken place so water goes up

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.090 
plus has taken place so water goes up
there<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.460> boots<00:01:05.670> gradually<00:01:06.180> become<00:01:06.510> more

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
there for boots gradually become more

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.210 
there for boots gradually become more
separate<00:01:08.100> against<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.840> ends<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
separate against and it ends up here so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
separate against and it ends up here so
this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> show<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> difference

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this is just to show you the difference

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.420 
this is just to show you the difference
that<00:01:13.380> submergence<00:01:14.189> mix<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:16.430> 20

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that submergence mix so this is at 20

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.100 
that submergence mix so this is at 20
inches<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.259> shall<00:01:19.530> bring<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.960> or<00:01:21.960> your

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
inches and I shall bring it up or your

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.399 
inches and I shall bring it up or your
bill<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.430> exactly<00:01:26.850> how<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.409> but

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
bill I don't know exactly how much but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
bill I don't know exactly how much but
we<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.430> hear<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> motor<00:01:29.970> changing<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
we can we can hear the motor changing a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.700 
we can we can hear the motor changing a
little<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:34.460> saying<00:01:36.049> 30<00:01:37.049> inches<00:01:38.240> so

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
little so this is a saying 30 inches so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.850 
little so this is a saying 30 inches so
the<00:01:40.710> air<00:01:41.460> speed<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:43.560> bringing

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the air speed up a little it's bringing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.040 
the air speed up a little it's bringing
less<00:01:44.189> water<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.880> head<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.619> see<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.829> here

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.540 

and<00:01:52.050> my<00:01:52.860> pump<00:01:53.160> is<00:01:53.370> probably<00:01:54.360> 40<00:01:54.920> but<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.280> just

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and my pump is probably 40 but it's just

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.180 
and my pump is probably 40 but it's just
to<00:01:56.670> give<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:56.970> idea<00:01:58.040> so<00:02:00.770> now<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
to give you an idea so now I'm going to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.550 
to give you an idea so now I'm going to
bring<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> right<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.760> again<00:02:03.300> I'm<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.470> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
bring it right up again I'm going to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.230 
bring it right up again I'm going to
bring<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.510> six<00:02:06.510> inches<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:09.030> see

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
bring it to six inches so now we can see

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.810 
bring it to six inches so now we can see
there's<00:02:09.479> much<00:02:09.720> less<00:02:09.990> air<00:02:10.259> coming<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.820> don't

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
there's much less air coming up don't

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.620 
there's much less air coming up don't
mind<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.180> curtain<00:02:12.630> around<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:14.300> make<00:02:15.300> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
mind about curtain around it's make it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.210 
mind about curtain around it's make it
makes<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.170> less<00:02:16.350> valid<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.010> not

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
makes it a little less valid but not

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.730 
makes it a little less valid but not
really<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.900> there<00:02:19.050> we're<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.380> getting<00:02:19.620> much

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
really so there we're not getting much

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.330 
really so there we're not getting much
water<00:02:20.010> target<00:02:20.550> 263<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.830> now<00:02:22.950> we're<00:02:23.100> going<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
water target 263 and now we're going to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.620 
water target 263 and now we're going to
bring<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.820> up<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.950> we're<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.100> right<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
bring it up to we're going right up to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.240 
bring it up to we're going right up to
see<00:02:28.400> four<00:02:29.400> inches<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.709> they're<00:02:31.830> hardly<00:02:32.100> any

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
see four inches so they're hardly any

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.670 
see four inches so they're hardly any
water<00:02:32.459> we<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.330> four<00:02:33.690> inches<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.989> submergence

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
water we have four inches of submergence

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.449 
water we have four inches of submergence
so<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> four<00:02:35.910> inch<00:02:36.120> mark<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.890> here<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
so the four inch mark is from here to

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.390 
so the four inch mark is from here to
the<00:02:38.880> top<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.300> water<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> four

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the top of the water in that so four

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.449 
the top of the water in that so four
inch<00:02:41.580> submergence<00:02:42.150> you're<00:02:42.300> getting<00:02:43.459> actually

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
inch submergence you're getting actually

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.830 
inch submergence you're getting actually
we're<00:02:44.610> hardly<00:02:44.820> getting<00:02:45.060> any<00:02:45.209> we're<00:02:45.720> getting

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
we're hardly getting any we're getting

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.490 
we're hardly getting any we're getting
just<00:02:46.200> dribbles<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:47.820> drop<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.480> down<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> six<00:02:49.230> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
just dribbles so drop it down to six and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.020 
just dribbles so drop it down to six and
see<00:02:49.620> how<00:02:49.680> quickly<00:02:49.920> changes<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.700> now<00:02:53.850> we're

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
see how quickly changes so now we're

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.590 
see how quickly changes so now we're
starting<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.360> get<00:02:54.450> water<00:02:54.660> again
