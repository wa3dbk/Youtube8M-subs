00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
in the air but they're not very good as
altering<00:01:41.430> vehicles<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.540> soon<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
altering vehicles and as soon as you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.950 
altering vehicles and as soon as you
leave<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.500> prepared<00:01:43.890> surface<00:01:44.509> at<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> fairly

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
leave the prepared surface at a fairly

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
leave the prepared surface at a fairly
high<00:01:46.079> rate<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.439> speed<00:01:46.590> you're<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
high rate of speed you're going to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
high rate of speed you're going to
you're<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.479> exactly<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.110> type<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you're going to see exactly the type of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
you're going to see exactly the type of
damage<00:01:49.740> we're<00:01:49.890> looking<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.520> yeah

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
damage we're looking at right now yeah

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.550 
damage we're looking at right now yeah
okay<00:01:51.750> Paul<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> details

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
okay Paul we don't have all the details

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
okay Paul we don't have all the details
as<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.310> happened<00:01:53.520> i'm<00:01:53.790> sure<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> NTSB<00:01:54.630> is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
as to what happened i'm sure the NTSB is

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
as to what happened i'm sure the NTSB is
on<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> scene<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.920> they're

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
on the scene right now and they're

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.770 
on the scene right now and they're
trying<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> figure<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.000> by<00:01:57.180> listening<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
trying to figure out by listening to the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 
trying to figure out by listening to the
tape<00:01:57.930> recordings<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> cockpit<00:01:58.860> however

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
tape recordings of the cockpit however

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.120 
tape recordings of the cockpit however
what<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.530> plane<00:02:01.860> was

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
what we do know was this plane was

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.149 
what we do know was this plane was
taking<00:02:02.579> off<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.270> accelerating<00:02:04.159> something

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
taking off it was accelerating something

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.760 
taking off it was accelerating something
caused<00:02:05.820> those<00:02:06.090> pilots<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> abort<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> takeoff

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
caused those pilots to abort the takeoff

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.609 
caused those pilots to abort the takeoff
do<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:09.060> weather<00:02:09.450> played<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.319> at

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
do you think weather played into this at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.449 
do you think weather played into this at
all<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.800> would<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.400> include

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
all and would that include

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.770 
all and would that include
well<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.489> would<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:13.970> very<00:02:14.000> surprised<00:02:14.629> if

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
well I would be very surprised if

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.330 
well I would be very surprised if
weather<00:02:15.050> played<00:02:15.379> into<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.680> because<00:02:15.920> at<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
weather played into it because at the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.979 
weather played into it because at the
time<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.819> weather<00:02:16.970> was<00:02:17.239> really<00:02:17.269> quite<00:02:17.750> good

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
time the weather was really quite good

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.430 
time the weather was really quite good
the<00:02:18.680> wind<00:02:18.920> while<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.430> was<00:02:19.610> 25<00:02:20.420> or<00:02:20.720> 30<00:02:20.930> miles<00:02:21.230> an

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
the wind while it was 25 or 30 miles an

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.680 
the wind while it was 25 or 30 miles an
hour<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.920> was<00:02:22.310> more<00:02:22.790> or<00:02:22.849> less<00:02:23.000> aligned<00:02:23.480> with

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
hour it was more or less aligned with

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.869 
hour it was more or less aligned with
the<00:02:23.810> runway<00:02:24.019> or<00:02:24.409> well<00:02:25.099> within<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.549> boundaries

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
the runway or well within the boundaries

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.030 
the runway or well within the boundaries
of<00:02:26.000> alignment<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.019> so<00:02:27.230> even<00:02:27.560> at<00:02:27.680> 30<00:02:27.950> knots

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
of alignment and so even at 30 knots

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.699 
of alignment and so even at 30 knots
wind<00:02:29.000> would<00:02:29.299> not<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.750> played<00:02:29.959> into<00:02:30.349> this<00:02:30.470> no

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
wind would not have played into this no

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.559 
wind would not have played into this no
this<00:02:30.890> was<00:02:31.129> almost<00:02:31.549> undoubtedly<00:02:32.000> an

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
this was almost undoubtedly an

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.660 
this was almost undoubtedly an
indication<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.620> mechanical<00:02:33.920> problem<00:02:34.640> that

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
indication of a mechanical problem that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.640 
indication of a mechanical problem that
was<00:02:34.879> serious<00:02:35.390> enough<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.840> cause<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.230> pilots

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
was serious enough to cause the pilots

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.759 
was serious enough to cause the pilots
as<00:02:37.519> they<00:02:37.849> are<00:02:37.970> properly<00:02:38.390> trained<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.200> reject

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
as they are properly trained to reject

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.289 
as they are properly trained to reject
the<00:02:39.829> takeoff<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.610> try<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.819> stop<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
the takeoff and to try to stop the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.229 
the takeoff and to try to stop the
aircraft<00:02:41.720> now<00:02:42.319> why<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.190> aircraft<00:02:43.760> left<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
aircraft now why the aircraft left the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.910 
aircraft now why the aircraft left the
runway<00:02:44.569> that's<00:02:44.989> that's<00:02:45.319> going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:45.890> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
runway that's that's going to have to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.520 
runway that's that's going to have to
wait<00:02:46.220> till<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.549> NTSB<00:02:47.269> records<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:48.410> it's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
wait till the NTSB records it but it's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.809 
wait till the NTSB records it but it's
fairly<00:02:48.709> certain<00:02:49.129> that<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.549> was<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
fairly certain that there was a

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.089 
fairly certain that there was a
mechanical<00:02:50.450> malfunction<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:51.290> caused<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
mechanical malfunction that caused the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.009 
mechanical malfunction that caused the
pilots<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.640> reject<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.000> takeoff<00:02:53.420> okay<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.900> it

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
pilots to reject the takeoff okay is it

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.020 
pilots to reject the takeoff okay is it
the<00:02:54.109> kind<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.530> mechanical<00:02:55.010> malfunction<00:02:55.760> again

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the kind of mechanical malfunction again

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.250 
the kind of mechanical malfunction again
I<00:02:56.060> know<00:02:56.180> you're<00:02:56.420> speculating<00:02:56.660> but<00:02:57.019> giving

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
I know you're speculating but giving

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.509 
I know you're speculating but giving
your<00:02:57.379> years<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.739> being<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.220> cockpit

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
your years of being in the cockpit

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.460 
your years of being in the cockpit
yourself<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.420> working<00:02:59.690> as<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.170> Pilots

yourself and working as a the Pilots
Association<00:03:00.709> spokesperson<00:03:02.319> would<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.349> be

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
Association spokesperson would it be

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.979 
Association spokesperson would it be
something<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.190> do<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.700> engine<00:03:05.299> fire<00:03:05.660> or

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
something to do with the engine fire or

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.930 
something to do with the engine fire or
might<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.530> have<00:03:06.590> started<00:03:07.069> even<00:03:07.220> after<00:03:07.819> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
might that have started even after the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.970 
might that have started even after the
whole<00:03:08.120> incident<00:03:08.150> got<00:03:08.780> underway<00:03:09.170> yeah<00:03:09.709> that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
whole incident got underway yeah that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.830 
whole incident got underway yeah that
that's<00:03:10.129> just<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.579> whole<00:03:10.670> thing<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.720> know

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
that's just the whole thing it you know

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.530 
that's just the whole thing it you know
an<00:03:11.989> engine<00:03:12.440> malfunction<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.879> most<00:03:14.209> usual

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
an engine malfunction is the most usual

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.710 
an engine malfunction is the most usual
cause<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.669> having<00:03:16.669> to<00:03:16.790> reject<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.269> take<00:03:17.480> off

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
cause of having to reject to take off

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.900 
cause of having to reject to take off
and<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.139> so<00:03:18.440> that's<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.889> one<00:03:19.099> that<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.519> you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and so so that's the one that that you

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.839 
and so so that's the one that that you
look<00:03:20.150> at<00:03:20.359> first<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.169> will<00:03:21.410> uh<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
look at first if you will uh the the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.020 
look at first if you will uh the the
flight<00:03:23.120> controls<00:03:24.250> he<00:03:25.250> may<00:03:25.639> not<00:03:25.819> have<00:03:25.880> been

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
flight controls he may not have been

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.870 
flight controls he may not have been
close<00:03:26.450> enough<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.870> fly<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.889> determine<00:03:28.669> that<00:03:28.760> he

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
close enough to fly to determine that he

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.220 
close enough to fly to determine that he
had<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.030> problem<00:03:29.269> with<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.569> flight<00:03:29.780> controls

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
had a problem with the flight controls

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.170 
had a problem with the flight controls
but<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.829> big<00:03:31.069> one<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.760> typically

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
but but the big one is is typically

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.729 
but but the big one is is typically
something<00:03:32.299> having<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:32.959> do<00:03:33.169> with<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.410> engine

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
something having to do with the engine

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.430 
something having to do with the engine
and<00:03:33.889> you'd<00:03:34.579> you'd<00:03:35.180> reject<00:03:35.389> the<00:03:35.750> take-off<00:03:36.169> on

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
and you'd you'd reject the take-off on

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.220 
and you'd you'd reject the take-off on
that<00:03:36.980> basis<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.299> if<00:03:38.389> you<00:03:38.569> had<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.840> serious

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
that basis and and if you had a serious

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.559 
that basis and and if you had a serious
problem<00:03:39.709> with<00:03:39.889> an<00:03:40.160> engine<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.940> could<00:03:41.000> then

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
problem with an engine it could then

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.420 
problem with an engine it could then
have<00:03:41.660> been<00:03:41.870> responsible<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.859> subsequent

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
have been responsible for a subsequent

have been responsible for a subsequent
post<00:03:43.669> post<00:03:44.329> fire<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.319> I<00:03:45.410> see<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.769> side<00:03:45.980> we're

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
post post fire and I see the side we're

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220 
post post fire and I see the side we're
looking<00:03:46.579> at<00:03:46.730> looks<00:03:47.419> fairly<00:03:47.690> good<00:03:48.019> but<00:03:48.200> I

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
looking at looks fairly good but I

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.020 
looking at looks fairly good but I

them in their fleet do you think people

them in their fleet do you think people
flying<00:04:01.760> on<00:04:01.970> 737<00:04:02.780> should<00:04:02.959> be<00:04:03.109> concerned<00:04:03.500> no<00:04:04.280> no

airplane but but you know it is it's a

the procedures are employed I want to

people were getting out of those planes
you<00:04:44.160> use<00:04:44.370> those<00:04:44.610> those<00:04:45.389> shoots<00:04:46.380> if<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.800> will

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
you use those those shoots if you will

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.800 
you use those those shoots if you will
we<00:04:47.430> know<00:04:47.610> two<00:04:47.669> people<00:04:48.240> were<00:04:48.360> critically

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
we know two people were critically

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.300 
we know two people were critically
injured<00:04:49.199> can<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.470> speculate<00:04:49.830> as<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.100> how

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
injured can you speculate as to how

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.710 
injured can you speculate as to how
those<00:04:50.550> injuries<00:04:50.880> may<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.180> happen<00:04:51.510> Paul

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
those injuries may have happen Paul

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.990 
those injuries may have happen Paul
again<00:04:52.440> but<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.979> reports<00:04:53.400> I've<00:04:53.580> seen

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
again but that the reports I've seen

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.030 
again but that the reports I've seen
indicate<00:04:54.449> that<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.810> critical<00:04:55.199> injuries<00:04:55.830> are

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
indicate that the critical injuries are

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.400 
indicate that the critical injuries are
having<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.639> do<00:04:56.760> with<00:04:56.880> fractures<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.720> and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
having to do with fractures and and

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.379 
having to do with fractures and and
frequently<00:04:58.979> we<00:04:59.220> will<00:04:59.370> see<00:04:59.639> that<00:04:59.820> when<00:05:00.000> people

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
frequently we will see that when people

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.990
