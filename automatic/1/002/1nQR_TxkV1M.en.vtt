00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.340 

okay<00:00:02.280> I've<00:00:02.429> got<00:00:02.580> it<00:00:02.610> apart<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.990> see<00:00:04.200> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
okay I've got it apart and we see the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.280 
okay I've got it apart and we see the
source<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.220> brake<00:00:05.580> fluid<00:00:05.609> leak<00:00:06.290> this

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
source of the brake fluid leak this

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.120 
source of the brake fluid leak this
wheel<00:00:07.950> cylinder<00:00:08.400> right<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.849> busted

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
wheel cylinder right here is busted

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.530 
wheel cylinder right here is busted
because<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.250> pulled<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.670> seal<00:00:12.030> back<00:00:12.240> while<00:00:12.450> we

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
because I pulled the seal back while we

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.020 
because I pulled the seal back while we
go<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.320> brake<00:00:13.950> fluid<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.580> pouring<00:00:14.849> out

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
go and brake fluid was just pouring out

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.750 
go and brake fluid was just pouring out
of<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.680> problem<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.670> this

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
of it so that is the problem with this

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.790 
of it so that is the problem with this
side<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.480> I'll<00:00:18.570> probably<00:00:18.690> go<00:00:18.930> ahead<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.529> put<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
side so I'll probably go ahead and put a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000 
side so I'll probably go ahead and put a
wheel<00:00:19.949> cylinder<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.410> probably<00:00:22.410> I'll

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
wheel cylinder in it and probably I'll

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.210 
wheel cylinder in it and probably I'll
go<00:00:23.130> ahead<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.460> replace<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.970> shoes<00:00:25.220> they're

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
go ahead and replace the shoes they're

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.470 
go ahead and replace the shoes they're
still<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.550> pretty<00:00:26.760> good<00:00:26.849> shape<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.420> be

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
still in pretty good shape they can be

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720 
still in pretty good shape they can be
cleaned<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.050> reused<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.250> might<00:00:29.699> as

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
cleaned up and reused but I might as

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.170 
cleaned up and reused but I might as
well<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.119> ahead<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.480> put<00:00:30.810> new<00:00:30.960> ones<00:00:30.990> on

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
well just go ahead and put new ones on

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
well just go ahead and put new ones on
and<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> course<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> springs<00:00:34.230> look<00:00:34.920> like

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and of course all the springs look like

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.910 
and of course all the springs look like
they're<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.579> good<00:00:35.760> shape<00:00:36.920> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
they're still in good shape the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:51.619 
they're still in good shape the
differential<00:00:38.520> feels<00:00:38.700> tight<00:00:50.360> looks<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
differential feels tight looks like the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.770 
differential feels tight looks like the
front<00:00:51.840> starting<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:53.180> thin<00:00:54.180> also

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
front starting to get a little thin also

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350 
front starting to get a little thin also
so<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.079> might<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.410> ahead<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.149> put<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> set<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
so I might go ahead and put a set of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.860 
so I might go ahead and put a set of
pads<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:58.609> parts<00:00:59.609> apart<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:03.300> course<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pads on parts apart of course the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:25.640 
pads on parts apart of course the
bearings<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.680> still<00:01:04.920> feel<00:01:06.650> smooth<00:01:24.470> abs<00:01:25.470> are

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
bearings they still feel smooth abs are

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.890 
bearings they still feel smooth abs are
about<00:01:25.860> wore<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.689> usually<00:01:27.689> when<00:01:27.810> they

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
about wore out also usually when they

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.899 
about wore out also usually when they
get<00:01:28.049> Warli<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.759> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
get Warli about when they get down to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
get Warli about when they get down to
that<00:01:29.939> point<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.829> make

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that point they get to where they make

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.640 
that point they get to where they make
noise<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.700> everything

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.380 

that<00:01:39.650> leaking<00:01:40.190> brake<00:01:40.850> system<00:01:46.060> here's<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.150> dry

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
that leaking brake system here's a dry

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.290 
that leaking brake system here's a dry
side<00:01:47.920> if<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.280> needs<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.550> be<00:01:49.640> cleaned<00:01:49.940> and

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
side if I just needs to be cleaned and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.130 
side if I just needs to be cleaned and
everything<00:01:50.870> locks<00:01:51.080> apart<00:01:52.780> see<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:53.960> still

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
everything locks apart see this still

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.990 
everything locks apart see this still
has<00:01:54.290> regional<00:01:55.060> parts<00:01:56.060> tag<00:01:56.330> still<00:01:56.990> on<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.440> shoe

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
has regional parts tag still on the shoe

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.630 
has regional parts tag still on the shoe
original<00:01:59.000> shoes<00:01:59.210> it's<00:01:59.540> never<00:01:59.720> been<00:01:59.810> apart<00:02:00.640> two

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
original shoes it's never been apart two

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.630 
original shoes it's never been apart two
hundred<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.090> six<00:02:02.750> thousand<00:02:03.230> miles<00:02:03.640> that's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
hundred and six thousand miles that's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.330 
hundred and six thousand miles that's
probably<00:02:04.940> about<00:02:05.030> time
