system<00:02:09.910> too<00:02:10.090> much<00:02:10.270> it's<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.630> terrible<00:02:11.140> but<00:02:11.350> at

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
system too much it's not terrible but at

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.820 
system too much it's not terrible but at
the<00:02:12.280> same<00:02:12.430> time<00:02:12.640> it's<00:02:12.850> not<00:02:12.970> great<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:14.650> thing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the same time it's not great one thing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.500 
the same time it's not great one thing
about<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.190> though<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.790> has<00:02:15.940> some<00:02:16.150> amazing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
about it though is it has some amazing

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.690 
about it though is it has some amazing
hand-drawn<00:02:17.319> artwork<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:18.100> all<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> sprites

and<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.569> enemy<00:02:20.290> designs<00:02:20.740> are<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.370> funny

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and the enemy designs are really funny

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.420 
and the enemy designs are really funny
really<00:02:22.720> original<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.650> highly<00:02:24.160> enjoyable

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
complaint I did have with this game was

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.440 
complaint I did have with this game was
the<00:03:02.810> camera<00:03:03.519> when<00:03:04.519> you're<00:03:04.640> in<00:03:04.819> towns<00:03:05.030> there's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the camera when you're in towns there's

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.300 
the camera when you're in towns there's
no<00:03:05.630> way<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.810> lock<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.290> camera<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.739> place<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
no way to lock the camera in place and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.070 
no way to lock the camera in place and
sometimes<00:03:08.030> you'll<00:03:08.180> find<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.569> just<00:03:08.750> swinging

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
sometimes you'll find it just swinging

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.289 
sometimes you'll find it just swinging
around<00:03:09.549> wildly<00:03:10.549> while<00:03:10.849> you're<00:03:11.030> trying<00:03:11.209> to

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
around wildly while you're trying to

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.080 
around wildly while you're trying to
explore<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.160> while<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.489> use<00:03:13.730> the

shoulder<00:03:14.480> buttons<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:15.080> send<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.799> right<00:03:16.069> and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
shoulder buttons to send it right and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.589 
shoulder buttons to send it right and
left<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.790> would<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.000> been<00:03:17.090> nice<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.299> have

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.550 
not have to deal with that all the time
as<00:03:22.099> far<00:03:22.310> as<00:03:22.340> dungeons<00:03:22.819> go<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.870> camera<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.319> in<00:03:24.349> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
as far as dungeons go the camera is in a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.229 
as far as dungeons go the camera is in a
fixed<00:03:24.830> position<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.700> gives<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.060> good

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
fixed position and it gives you a good

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.809 
fixed position and it gives you a good
view<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.599> action<00:03:27.430> dungeons<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.670> be

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
view of the action dungeons can be

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.190 
view of the action dungeons can be
really<00:03:29.180> confusing<00:03:29.569> though<00:03:29.810> sometimes

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
really confusing though sometimes

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.590 
really confusing though sometimes
especially<00:03:30.440> one<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.100> later<00:03:31.280> ones<00:03:31.600> there

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
especially one of the later ones there

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.090 
especially one of the later ones there
was<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:32.900> maze<00:03:33.200> where<00:03:33.530> everything<00:03:33.920> looked

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
was this maze where everything looked

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.880 
was this maze where everything looked
the<00:03:34.190> same<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:35.510> step<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:35.900> these<00:03:36.049> tiles<00:03:36.560> and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
the same and you step on these tiles and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.069 
the same and you step on these tiles and
it<00:03:37.730> would<00:03:37.880> turn<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.299> room<00:03:38.510> around<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.019> you

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
it would turn the room around and you

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.880 
it would turn the room around and you
get<00:03:39.200> all<00:03:39.470> confused<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.190> lost<00:03:40.370> oh<00:03:41.680> yeah<00:03:42.709> other
