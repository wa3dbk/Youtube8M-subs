00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
will also show you the 4G test which I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.789 
will also show you the 4G test which I
took<00:01:10.070> yesterday<00:01:11.070> evening<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.619> was

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
took yesterday evening so that it was

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.090 
took yesterday evening so that it was
giving<00:01:14.040> more<00:01:14.250> high-speed<00:01:15.590> cuz<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> peak

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
giving more high-speed cuz it's a peak

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
giving more high-speed cuz it's a peak
time<00:01:17.340> by<00:01:17.700> 11<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.869> network<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
time by 11 so it's the network is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
time by 11 so it's the network is
congested<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.340> by<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:20.670> ATM<00:01:21.000> abs<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.390> also

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
congested so by the way ATM abs is also

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.030 
congested so by the way ATM abs is also
very<00:01:21.840> good<00:01:21.900> speed<00:01:23.900> then<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.500> watch

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
affected by the speed that much that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.420 
affected by the speed that much that
much<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> basic<00:01:37.229> stuff<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.530> YouTube<00:01:38.100> and

there's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> separate<00:02:00.689> video<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> sim<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
there's a separate video for the sim you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.530 
there's a separate video for the sim you
can<00:02:01.500> check<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.420> have

fortune a mobile you can use this
hotspot<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.399> see<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> 4G<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.459> now<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> will

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
hotspot and see the 4G and now I will

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.699 
hotspot and see the 4G and now I will
put<00:02:09.000> Facebook<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.259> how
