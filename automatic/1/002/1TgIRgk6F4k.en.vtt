00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 which I have and is the oldest I have e 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.880
 so we call it the old model 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.919
 for the first time on my channel between 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.899
 the other you have seen only in photos 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.510
 today we're going to make this make up 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.750
 here that I think is on his eyes 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 greens to perfection because we have a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 burgundy color 2 shaded eyeliner a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 own eyeliner double codari now vi 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 we leave to the details this there is the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.789
 birth so don't worry but if 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.039
 you want to emulate it around here already 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.749
 launched fashion 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.300
 hi bye and here we are girls then 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.420
 let's start with this shiseido primer 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 offering just the silky skin 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.979
 minimizes then with a 2 fibers him 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.979
 I'm going to spread all over my face 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 later with this pencil of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.820
 green max factor that I really find 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.940
 really very convenient to go to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 correct blushes and all names of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.820
 I produce products in the info box 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.159
 girls just go to correct the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 story then you correct them with corrections 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.720
 powder that has very important with 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.210
 this phantasmagoric corrector of 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.240
 shiseido that I've been idolizing lately 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 I go over to buffer the corrections already 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:55.320
 you do so by seeing that you don't 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:58.440
 there are more girls this is a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.700
 foundation of glossip with veil effect e 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.640
 alessandra did not have ceroni we say to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.470
 now just wear very light things 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.690
 because it really annoys her and therefore 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.790
 I'm going to apply this foundation here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.610
 because it is particularly light and has 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.840
 an almost impalpable veil effect on the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.640
 face 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.630
 I take back my shiseido concealer 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.400
 with whom I just don't go out and go to 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.989
 correct the dark circles of alexandra 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.850
 subsequently I am in fixed with the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.940
 you know I love the basics 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.560
 perfect tonal father with a face powder 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.560
 this too is from Shiseido 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.510
 always with the first primer I go to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.820
 also apply it on the eyelid 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.380
 wait 30 seconds for it to dry 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.620
 panel meanwhile I am going to outline 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:59.590
 more eyebrows with this one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.690
 fantastic eye shadow in shiseido cream 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.070
 yes I saw it not even noticed in this 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.630
 video there are different products of 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.760
 shiseido for continually precisely them 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.700
 is testing and there are some that 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.000
 they are really very children this is here 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.160
 a sort of brown but it turns out 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.800
 on the eyelid of alessandra burgundy 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.530
 in fact it is a mystery enough 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.690
 interesting later with this one 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.590
 pencil that is of urban decay I go to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.510
 outline the root of the eyelashes and then 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.390
 I make two dots as you can see 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.910
 guide to understand where to go to 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.730
 finish eyeliner that we will go to anyway 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.850
 do shaded with a pointed brush 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.700
 why alessandra to the big eye e 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.580
 then the defined eyeliner made with a 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.160
 frost in the pen is not particularly so 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.620
 well and better on this type of 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.450
 eyes here go and do it nuanced like 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.480
 see I am adding colors for 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.790
 fade now I also take this color 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.040
 burgundy precisely pita 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.859
 a shiseido trio and I'm going to apply it 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.180
 above the cream eye shadow to fix it 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.150
 make sure that I don't make the folds 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.760
 even if in any case he does not do them with the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.730
 first black pencil I'm going to create 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.789
 eyeliner below and this too I go to 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.150
 blend to create then two pigtails in the 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.680
 end of the eye that are parallel between 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.840
 of them 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.620
 now with this plum here 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.889
 nabla matt is to blend more 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.500
 the line below and then girls reply 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.860
 maurice out shaded to yours 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.860
 will 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.790
 lands of mulacchiÃ¨ in powder I go with 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.040
 two colors quite clear so I 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.710
 a cold and a heat come out to get 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.480
 a fairly neutral shade and I go to 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.280
 to realize with touring on alessandra not 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.370
 I use only a cold color 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.260
 because she already has cold colors and therefore 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.180
 I'm going to make a mix then use 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.950
 dell of nars that will now go to now 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.650
 I'm going to make the blush in 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.710
 then with this no benefit mascara 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.810
 I'm going to apply it on my eyelashes and now 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.820
 with this just illuminating I go to 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.740
 create light points 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.080
 premise of jackets alessandra does not adore 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.170
 lipsticks and then left her 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.720
 practically without lipstick applied 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.490
 only a wide lipgloss guys a 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.350
 this is the effect of and I hope that 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.960
 either liked let me know with a 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.560
