00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.457
 "Changing our taste buds" 

00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:09.103
 How we overcome innate desire 

00:00:09.103 --> 00:00:11.368
 salt, sugar and fat? 

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:14.325
 Now we have scientific evidence to support the claim, 

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:15.667
 that after a few weeks of reduced consumption 

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:21.943
 Unhealthy food and animal products are changing our tastes. 

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:24.840
 We believe that people can really have 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.173
 taste for fatty food as well as for sweet, sour and salty. 

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:30.039
 People on low-fat diets over time 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.649
 They start to enjoy low-fat foods and less fat foods. 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.840
 Indeed, our languages ​​can become more sensitive to the fat taken in the food. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.932
 And the more sensitive our language is, 

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:43.390
 The less we eat butter, meat, dairy products and eggs. 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.300
 If the perception of fat taste is dull, 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.097
 we tend to get too much fat. 

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.500
 Such people usually eat more calories, fat, 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.102
 dairy products, meat and eggs. They also wear more fat on themselves. 

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:57.205
 And this change in perception, the numbness of the fat, 

00:00:57.205 --> 00:01:00.506
 it can take a few weeks. 

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:04.358
 If you put people on a low salt diet within a few weeks 

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:07.699
 the popularity of unsalted soup begins to rise 

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:10.493
 and the salty soup will taste less and less. 

00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:13.013
 Your tastes change physically. 

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:16.373
 If you let the participants salt their own soup, 

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:20.385
 So the longer they are on a low salt diet, the less they will salt. 

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:25.309
 Even with half the amount of salt, the soup was sufficiently salty. 

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:30.710
 The control group liked the very salty soup. 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.968
 Those with limited salt intake perceived commonly salty foods 

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.293
 as too salty and preferred 

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:38.624
 less salted soup. 

00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:41.060
 People should be assured that their new diet 

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:45.540
 it will gradually become more acceptable to them because their taste for salt will be reduced. 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 The longer we eat healthy food, the more we like it.
