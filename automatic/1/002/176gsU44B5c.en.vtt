00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 numbers to all in missions of Barcelona 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.839
 today I bring you another guitar reason in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 this time they will be cardinal numbers of 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.600
 AndÃ©n SuÃ¡rez, a nation that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.590
 does not have many chords but has a 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.200
 special technique with fingers and such and 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.110
 good thing is getting complicated and already 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.939
 It's time for me to teach something else 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.359
 complicated and not so simple and good 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 I hope you like it and we are going to put 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.070
 Well, we started in the first place 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 We will need to continue on 1st fret and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.739
 good the chords are not very complicated 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.970
 the trick is in the right hand that already 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.950
 we'll see later 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.020
 around the holy song we will go 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.410
 moving with simple chords of agreement 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.620
 they are lesser ' all some the least 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 will appear and some sign 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.930
 newspaper the trick is the hand 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.360
 right is what makes the song 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.460
 be special and have this touch 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.790
 of agreement we begin with the verse of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790
 agreement 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 i 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.260
 in agreement 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.180
 this is the intro and the person are the same 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.180
 okay it 's just with your fingers here 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.680
 with two things 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.930
 all right 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 3 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.440
 very well 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.060
 i 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.370
 and here is when a change comes 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.180
 this is that is quite simple of 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.820
 agreement 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.340
 6 straight songs are network 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.200
 and less if 7a 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.640
 or not 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.230
 that is seventh is simply the finger 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.820
 index on the fifth string contrast and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.820
 the middle finger here the third string 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.460
 6 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.660
 okay and we'll see it again 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.660
 always us 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.690
 and less 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.530
 song cuts that went through what 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.530
 much consulted 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 and while sometimes I will always tell 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.080
 and we repeat the same change as before 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.080
 five fingers 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
 remember 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.650
 I want here before entering he wrote the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.650
 less over 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:32.719
 it's like the least like the best not normal 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.989
 but here we media ring and of 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.989
 agreement 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.489
 according to simple 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.489
 my youngest but it is city 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.150
 and you will see it 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:04:01.700
 and now second part of Seville only if 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.700
 you want to take off we stop 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:14.920
 always always is are we change below 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.639
 it's just the index finger here in the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.160
 sixth string the second fret and the 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.760
 heart here in the in the third 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.760
 contribution of others 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 my minor 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:39.449
 and we finish the 2 and repeat the verse and 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.850
 here I would go back 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.620
 we have another chorus wheel 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.880
 and it's just this is that simple 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.520
 but the trick is on the right hand very 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.729
 has said let's learn the pace of 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.830
 agree the rhythm that we're going to see what 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.090
 important in this song is the secret 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.220
 to pinch the strings according 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.759
 For example, I'll play the chord of the sun 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.460
 okay the trick is to pinch the 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.470
 sixth string with the first second and 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.240
 third with these three fingers of 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.750
 agreement 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.750
 Y 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.150
 agree the trick 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:24.029
 that expedition stop said and we fit 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.029
 agreement 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.060
 here in the dow whenever we play a 2 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.570
 the thumb will have to go to the fifth 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.650
 rope of agreement because the tonic me 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.930
 I remembered from 2 you find the fifth 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.910
 this we will see later 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.389
 but when we play the dow we play the 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.389
 fifth string 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.320
 why 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.919
 and also if you want instead of pinching 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.229
 these first three you can verify 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.740
 this is there is the fat the second 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.740
 third and fourth 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.130
 It's a different I do the truth 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.500
 instinctively I do not notice 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.110
 pinch the first three in these 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.030
 here I'm just touching what 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.890
 important is the thumb touching the thumb 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.750
 where he plays when we put a sun in the 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.150
 sixth when we play a first in the 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.040
 sixth and how I have as we do not touch the 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.330
 and minors and the two in the fifth account 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.130
 where you can verify where you want in 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.750
 the three pounds with the second ones 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.640
 third and fourth is indifferent to 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.640
 agreement solsona equally well 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.740
 Y 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.740
 Y 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.370
 and the trick is to think and stop 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.470
 chords 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.220
 We put the fist or whatever you want to 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.220
 brake the ropes 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.920
 yes 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.170
 and 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.910
 i 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.870
 for me 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.930
 no no 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.790
 and such 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.560
 i 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.030
 agree and that this time 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.270
 used across the nation even in the 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.270
 chorus 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.070
 helps you raise market exchanges 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.090
 to the 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.090
 if you want 

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.010
 if you want more 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.190
 I am 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.910
 because this is the rhythm and I hope there 

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.480
 be clear if you have any questions 

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:07.070
 especially leave me the comments and 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.830
 I also leave my twitter here for you 

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.440
 you want to follow me and propose my songs 

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.420
 to teach you and such and such nothing 

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.540
 more see you next video until 

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.540
 then
