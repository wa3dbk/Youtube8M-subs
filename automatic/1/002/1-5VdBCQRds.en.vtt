00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.240
 It is Ishibashi of child application making classroom Ia. 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.800
 When children were playing with bamboo dragonfly, 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 Even such a thread winding car was a good teaching material. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 The times have passed and the children's play has changed completely. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.760
 The teaching materials should have evolved accordingly. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.860
 Now small children 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 The age of touching the tablet before speaking words. 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.580
 The teaching materials used and the fun of manufacturing 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.100
 It is necessary to push it up to the stage one rank higher. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.200
 You can do that if you have "Nose radi" 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 If you use Nose radio, you can make your own work 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 It becomes a radio control that can be operated with iPhone and iPad. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.630
 It is easy to use. 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.660
 Put the radio on the machine work using the motor 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.370
 Just connect the battery and the motor. 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.050
 Using a dedicated app downloaded from the app store 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 Two motors can be turned while changing the speed. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.380
 Install the switch and press it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.040
 It is also possible to change the movement of the motor. 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.500
 Nose radio is essential for future school education 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.910
 It has a very high affinity to learning such as "programming" and "control". 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.880
 From primary school students to college students if you use the app properly 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.740
 Has the potential to support a wide range of learning courses. 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 If the work I made was moving in front of my eyes 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 It helps direct understanding and stimulates learning motivation. 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.260
 It can be said that it is a new option as a method of utilizing the tablet introduced to the school. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.820
 We are planning to release a development kit to create a dedicated radio application. 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.629
 You can freely create an original app tailored to your work. 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:23.349
 Because it can be easily attached to the breadboard, it can be used for electronic work. 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.219
 Mainly on the "Nose radio" series such as work contests 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.079
 I want to develop a manufacturing community. 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.159
 It is the first step for that 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.379
 Thank you for your support for this project.
