00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.669 
because it's a bolt-action sniper rifle
it<00:01:48.259> has<00:01:48.799> no<00:01:49.399> magazine<00:01:50.240> no<00:01:50.270> magazine<00:01:50.929> so<00:01:51.590> you

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
it has no magazine no magazine so you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.399 
it has no magazine no magazine so you
never<00:01:52.069> have<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.490> reload<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.060> believe<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.539> has<00:01:53.630> 23

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
never have to reload I believe it has 23

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.190 
never have to reload I believe it has 23
shots<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.609> could<00:01:55.759> fire<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.390> every<00:01:57.170> time

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
shots that you could fire and every time

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.099 
shots that you could fire and every time
that<00:01:57.499> you<00:01:57.859> shoot<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:59.149> put<00:01:59.390> another<00:01:59.630> bullet<00:01:59.840> in

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
that you shoot you put another bullet in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.480 
that you shoot you put another bullet in
the<00:02:00.200> chamber<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.829> that's<00:02:01.069> how<00:02:01.219> he<00:02:01.249> keeps

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the chamber and that's how he keeps

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.069 
the chamber and that's how he keeps
going<00:02:01.819> so<00:02:01.939> just<00:02:01.969> imagine<00:02:02.299> some<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.929> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
going so just imagine some of the

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.480 
going so just imagine some of the
streaks<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.619> could<00:02:03.770> go<00:02:03.889> on<00:02:04.039> for<00:02:04.399> example

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
streaks that you could go on for example

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.690 
streaks that you could go on for example
like<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.149> 23-man<00:02:06.109> perfectionist<00:02:07.069> that<00:02:07.399> would

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
like a 23-man perfectionist that would

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.270 
like a 23-man perfectionist that would
be<00:02:07.880> such<00:02:08.179> an<00:02:08.390> insane<00:02:08.899> clip<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.710> it'll

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
be such an insane clip and it'll

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.950 
be such an insane clip and it'll
definitely<00:02:10.460> make<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:11.030> an<00:02:11.180> entertaining<00:02:11.450> game

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960
