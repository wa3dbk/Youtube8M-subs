00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.870
 world just pulls his hand his hand 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.010
 low to me am I'm not already that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.090
 I open my mouth a lot you see 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.470
 I am every day on the radio at the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.820
 TV everything was dull as me 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.740
 it's painful already you're in moment I'm 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.240
 support more so I imagine that more I 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.330
 go on twitter tell my life sees 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.040
 so I i I do not see any interest 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.990
 so I know where I am asked 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.760
 it seems that it is good now no 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.070
 I do not want to go back 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.950
 the deadline to the maximum and facebook then 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.920
 still less me no I 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:16.579
 I want to know why not it's not 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.179
 it's not a question of age I am 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.250
 modest saw it like me I'm too 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.929
 shy what's important is 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.189
 to allow if people interactivity 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.780
 between you and your people because you 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.399
 see not look but I know 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 that it is not us it is precisely this 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.649
 we know it's true it's nice 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.450
 so after that it's probably the problem 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.490
 that I often have that's what 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.110
 especially when you do a 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.580
 c thing I not do it or I do it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.330
 background 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.380
 that's what I'm asking myself 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.729
 problems often because I wanted 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.349
 do tv radio in matha 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.399
 and suddenly it makes me a lot of 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:51.200
 job and and that's it and suddenly I say to myself 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.599
 if I put myself there on twitter for 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.360
 send a tweet or the 35 of the month for 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.560
 to put unbalanced stuff you see and like 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.299
 I do not want to fall in the stuff or 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.869
 tweeted all day to tell 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.549
 bullshit 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.959
 if you want I would have to come to 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.210
 find the happy medium where maybe to 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.040
 a given moment 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.940
 the fact that I have little more time 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.140
 will make me or I have less than 2 back 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.220
 because there we work on TV at the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.480
 radio despite all the people you do not 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.940
 see in the street you see you're talking 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.350
 with them so I did not have that lack there 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.030
 maybe I swear it's nicolas 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.350
 and I will need that discussed a few 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.730
 because no one is going to talk to me anymore 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.460
 my wife left I would have more friends 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.510
 very wide but we will be there it is a 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.510
 matter that is not of concern
