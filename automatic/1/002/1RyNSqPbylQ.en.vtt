00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 this happened about seven 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 months however I still can not 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.260
 recover from it I have a sister 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.570
 minor alicia she loves the movies and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.820
 series but many of the programs 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 children are not very good now 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.580
 As they used to be, those of my time were 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.680
 great dexter i am the weasel rock &amp; 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 power etcetera my favorite was the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 superpower girls every time you 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 I tell alicia the cartoons in my 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.070
 times were much better than now 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 she gets angry and contradicts me then 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.969
 one day I decided to prove to him that I had 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.219
 reason I was returning from my job 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.020
 because my parents died when I was 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.879
 young and alive now alone with alicia 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 when I saw that a video store was 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.590
 selling all your videos at low prices 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 since I was going to close I went in and asked if 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 they also had series chapters and I 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.489
 they answered that if I went to the section of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.079
 television series and I started looking 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 some chapter of the girls 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.539
 superpowers because there was none 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.850
 I ducked to search between the shelves of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.259
 below and I found one that was called 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.939
 the Powerpuff Girls 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.369
 pulpí was the bubble stuffed octopus 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.430
 He was very tender although he always had a 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.170
 tired looking for his eyes I went to the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.909
 box and it was there where I would have to 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.950
 to have realized that I did not have to 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.840
 buy the cassette the seller of 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.810
 local was messy and seemed 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.970
 lunatic I asked him how much was the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 video and he looked at me with those eyes like 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.289
 out of orbit and he replied that I 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.350
 I was just free him away from the 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.630
 store honestly scared me but 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.060
 well you know you do not have to prejudge 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.220
 the people maybe had had a bad 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 day I arrived at my house and I told my 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.530
 sister for today enough of silly series and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.110
 to look at real cartoons I put the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.020
 video on the vhs and we went to bed 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.390
 bed squeezed play the video started with 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.830
 the typical introduction to sugar flowers and 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 many colors these were the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.299
 ingredients chosen to create the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.670
 perfect little girl but Professor Antonio 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.700
 accidentally added another ingredient 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.860
 to the formula the substance x well 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 I had a smile on my face 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.630
 remember my childhood moments after 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.210
 that was the title of the episode 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.700
 and the names of the filmmakers started 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340
 the bubble chapter was fighting with 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.470
 Acorn for pulp and acorn told him that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.160
 that doll seemed diabolical and that was 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.050
 ugly 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.660
 then bubble was pushing her and she 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.520
 shouted after it appeared bonbon and the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.610
 separated but the girls were still 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.190
 fighting was fun acorn laughed and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.260
 bubble was very angry galicia 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.750
 I looked attentively as if I were 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.400
 discovering a whole new world but 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.100
 there was when everything got weird 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.590
 very annoying bubble throw you rays 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.350
 laser those that come out of your eyes to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.630
 acorn and this screams of pain the scream 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.680
 It was too real, it got our skin 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.020
 of chicken 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.060
 then bonbon bubble pushes and challenges 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.820
 then she grabs a candy by the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.310
 bun begins to spin throws 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.650
 against a wall and spits acorn 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.420
 try to intervene but bubble breaks 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.120
 one leg and hit him in the eye that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.970
 started to bleed strongly followed 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.490
 hitting and acorn from the floor screamed 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 and cried of pain the bones creaked and 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.349
 the blood shed for all 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.659
 of the girls room finally 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.750
 acorn without an eye with the mouth bleeding 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.450
 without teeth the leg the arm the chest 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.760
 and the broken skull dies look at my sister 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.920
 I was horrified embrace her but 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.920
 I understood that I had to turn off yes or yes 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.599
 that VCR I tried to turn it off but 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.819
 the button ignored me 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.680
 while bubble laughing and laughing 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.689
 Bombon cried over the corpse of 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.939
 acorn and it was there when bonbon 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.890
 angrily grabbed bubble and the 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.440
 He crashed to the floor and started 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.170
 hit him with all his strength kicking pineapples 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.019
 kicked she kept laughing now with 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.819
 blood in your mouth and on your entire face 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.670
 bubble stopped laughing as she lay dead 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.150
 on the floor now hottie laughs and records to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.970
 the time 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.189
 Pulpí was leaning on the bed of the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.290
 side of the light blue bubble cover and 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.840
 began to move slowly towards the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.909
 head of bonbon my sister cried and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.159
 I was very scared and I was 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 desperate to turn off the vhs or the 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.430
 TV 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.979
 then unplug the television 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.260
 turned off and I went to hug my sister but 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.400
 suddenly caught back and we 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.889
 we were stunned 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.800
 the octopus was in the head of bonbon 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.990
 pulling out of the eyes on the bun and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.360
 she screamed in pain then she 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.699
 the tentacles began to grow 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.100
 introduced by the empty basins where 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.169
 before there were the eyes and they began to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.660
 come out by the ears all full of 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.180
 blood through the mouth the nose that now 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.490
 I had and the chocolate vagina I started 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.800
 cry there was no way to stop the video 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.380
 that torture that he was doing that 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.770
 octopus to bonbon the screams reigned in the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.510
 room and we were very scared 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.970
 finally hottie finished dying and 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.430
 the octopus began to float and settled 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.190
 in the bed he had red eyes and 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.930
 yellows with angry face started to 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.210
 look at the camera and slowly it was 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.000
 zooming to the image 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.130
 of the octopus in all the television seemed 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.590
 and I could not but terror that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.270
 the image shook our body 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.190
 began to weaken and it was 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.470
 disappearing with that noise so 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.389
 unexplainable as of when a channel does not 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.240
 is available and has the screen to 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.190
 gray with those black spots finally 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.200
 it stopped and the television went off 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.360
 I ran to take the video and took it to the 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.610
 I threw it in a trash can and 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.070
 I went home to comfort my sister 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.770
 but when I came back I found her looking at 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.080
 television up close me to the 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.180
 screen and we discovered that it had been 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.910
 the image of pulpí as burned in the 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.040
 I hugged my sister and asked her 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.260
 sorry the next day we sold the 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.690
 TV and never again did I know what happened to 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.730
 the video I searched forums on the internet about 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.830
 this chapter and I found a picture that 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.350
 was eliminated shortly after the bird 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.900
 It was equal to what we had seen Alice 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.290
 and I 'm good that's all I hope you 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.290
 like
