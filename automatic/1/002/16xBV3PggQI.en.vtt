going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.780> do<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> little<00:02:33.049> investigating<00:02:33.799> and

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
going to do a little investigating and

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.089 
going to do a little investigating and
we're<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.760> see<00:02:34.940> what<00:02:35.120> kind<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.390> run<00:02:35.599> out

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
we're going to see what kind of run out

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.259 
we're going to see what kind of run out
that<00:02:37.099> we've<00:02:37.280> got<00:02:37.519> on<00:02:38.480> our<00:02:38.750> Center<00:02:39.080> tips<00:02:40.269> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
that we've got on our Center tips and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.610 
that we've got on our Center tips and
I've<00:02:41.420> got<00:02:41.720> around<00:02:43.180> 7/10<00:02:44.180> that's<00:02:45.049> less<00:02:45.379> than

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
I've got around 7/10 that's less than

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.050 
one thousandth run out here on the dead
center<00:02:51.310> we'll<00:02:52.310> come<00:02:52.489> over<00:02:52.640> here<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:52.940> we're

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
center we'll come over here and we're

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.039 
going to check the live Center then
we're<00:02:56.239> going<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.660> turn<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:58.250> tip

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049

it's<00:04:07.099> a<00:04:07.190> nice<00:04:07.370> precision<00:04:07.819> unit<00:04:09.069> these

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
it's a nice precision unit these

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.659 
it's a nice precision unit these
bushings<00:04:10.519> will<00:04:10.700> go<00:04:10.879> in<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:12.489> we're<00:04:13.489> going<00:04:13.579> to

bushings will go in and we're going to

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.289 
bushings will go in and we're going to
put<00:04:13.849> these<00:04:14.000> between<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.660> Centers<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:16.299> we're

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
put these between the Centers and we're

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.400 
put these between the Centers and we're
going<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.449> check<00:04:17.660> run<00:04:17.959> out<00:04:18.199> on<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.039> bushings

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
going to check run out on the bushings

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.360 
going to check run out on the bushings
because<00:04:21.410> while<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.829> center's<00:04:22.190> may<00:04:22.400> be<00:04:22.460> good

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
because while the center's may be good

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.450 
because while the center's may be good
you<00:04:25.370> need<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.669> check<00:04:25.880> your<00:04:26.060> bushings

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
you need to check your bushings

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.879 
you need to check your bushings
if<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.540> got<00:04:28.720> problems<00:04:29.020> with<00:04:29.320> your<00:04:29.470> bushings

that<00:04:59.440> same<00:05:01.169> 7/10<00:05:02.169> less<00:05:03.010> than<00:05:03.250> 1,000<00:05:03.940> thrown

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
that same 7/10 less than 1,000 thrown

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.000 
that same 7/10 less than 1,000 thrown
out<00:05:04.620> okay<00:05:06.810> like<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.930> said<00:05:08.169> this<00:05:08.380> is<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.590> precision

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
out okay like I said this is a precision

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.930 
out okay like I said this is a precision
machine<00:05:09.479> pin<00:05:10.479> blank<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:12.280> would<00:05:12.460> expect

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
machine pin blank and I would expect

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.260 
machine pin blank and I would expect
good<00:05:13.210> results<00:05:13.270> with<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.580> next<00:05:15.580> what<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:15.970> want<00:05:16.210> to

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
good results with it next what I want to

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.060 
good results with it next what I want to
show<00:05:16.419> you<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.289> importance<00:05:17.860> I've<00:05:18.729> run<00:05:19.030> out

an adjustment arm here it's got a fine
travel<00:06:45.550> adjustment<00:06:46.089> also<00:06:46.240> some<00:06:46.990> don't<00:06:47.289> look

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099 
travel adjustment also some don't look

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.010 
travel adjustment also some don't look
for<00:06:48.339> one<00:06:48.490> with<00:06:48.520> fine<00:06:49.029> adjustment<00:06:49.659> on<00:06:49.749> it's

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
for one with fine adjustment on it's

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.100 
for one with fine adjustment on it's
well<00:06:50.199> worth<00:06:50.409> the<00:06:50.619> extra<00:06:50.740> few<00:06:51.129> dollars<00:06:51.899> and<00:06:52.899> we

well worth the extra few dollars and we

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.799 
well worth the extra few dollars and we
basically<00:06:53.349> put<00:06:53.860> this<00:06:54.009> on<00:06:54.279> the<00:06:54.459> lathe<00:06:54.719> put<00:06:55.719> it

00:06:55.799 --> 00:06:55.809 
basically put this on the lathe put it

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:57.480 
basically put this on the lathe put it
on<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.080> ways<00:06:56.259> you<00:06:56.589> have<00:06:56.709> to<00:06:56.889> adjust<00:06:57.009> this

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
on the ways you have to adjust this

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.809 
on the ways you have to adjust this
around<00:06:57.959> in<00:06:58.959> a<00:06:59.080> bit<00:06:59.229> of<00:06:59.349> a<00:06:59.409> cramped<00:06:59.800> fashion<00:07:00.370> and

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
around in a bit of a cramped fashion and

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.179 
around in a bit of a cramped fashion and
you<00:07:00.999> can<00:07:01.180> get<00:07:01.360> that<00:07:01.620> where<00:07:02.620> it<00:07:02.709> still<00:07:03.009> got<00:07:03.129> a

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:03.189 
you can get that where it still got a

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.519 
you can get that where it still got a
little<00:07:03.339> travel<00:07:03.879> and<00:07:04.089> you<00:07:04.659> can<00:07:04.689> check<00:07:05.019> run<00:07:05.289> out

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:05.529 
little travel and you can check run out
