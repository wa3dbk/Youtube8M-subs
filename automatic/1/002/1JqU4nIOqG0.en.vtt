00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.320
 well we finish ours today 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.960
 shooting time 2006 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.900
 we spent the whole day farming 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.279
 Sergey economy, both Klykova Perepelochka 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.800
 and then the economy or how to about 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.759
 You can say of course, too, yes, because 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.300
 equipment is also up to the economy of Alexander 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.320
 Even lightning in the mountains, I'm more satisfied with the novel 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.210
 where altiplano plan it yes here 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.890
 in fact, we still have not removed everything 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.200
 we still do not know how much we will 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.080
 shoot here i'm not just somewhere over there 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.940
 caps and teas we also work long 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.420
 so alexander let's talk about it 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.540
 tea well what 's the fresh drink we have on 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.640
 the table should be tea-colored but 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.010
 now there is a little greens 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.290
 This suggests that I still not 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.660
 lined up he needed about a month 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.229
 two or three to slightly turn black 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.399
 and amida infusions of course not yes and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.640
 buy here the very characteristic 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.520
 fragrance for which connoisseurs love him so much 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 let's say this drink product i 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.120
 recommend 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.560
 add a little sugar but no one 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.950
 and sugar is a little honey 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.840
 perfect honey which does not contain which 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.920
 does not have its own taste almost 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 such as grape acacia honey 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.710
 Kiprey on perfect just for 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.600
 drinking 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.280
 a little bit it's worth adding not barcha 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.220
 either who doesn't love who wants to save 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.619
 safe and sound product 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.940
 accordingly drinks in the presence of 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.590
 draws attention to the fact that during 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.760
 welding should be formed 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.920
 be sure to foam it is such a thick foam 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.670
 white but now she has to drive away from here 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.070
 before it says that tea 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.890
 saturated with essential oils is nothing else 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.409
 as the so-called tea cream in 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.370
 brewing time essential oils accumulate 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.680
 on a surface 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.200
 no more than a given surface form here 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.270
 such a characteristic skin it should not 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.010
 be a series it should be foam 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.240
 number indicates that the water is or is not the same 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:17.180
 no ducks of the furnace were not allowed either she 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.040
 may be too hot that is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.780
 essential oils can quickly evaporate 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.650
 and form such a not so beautiful 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.840
 strand precisely thick foam speaks of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.140
 Narrow thoughts like cream empty and patterns 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.420
 and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 let's say as probably as a powder 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.440
 washing foam form may not be 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.290
 so thick it is more rarefied 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.790
 should be yes well around the edges you 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 be sure to see her during 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.080
 brewing it says that 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.950
 quality product 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.500
 made correctly not overdried and contains 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.630
 all helpful 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.630
 substances in this case useful for 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:02.210
 ivan-tea ivan-tea as a product and that's what 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.580
 you can still say but as we said 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.580
 the longer the abbot gets better 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.080
 if today is the month of July 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.580
 but almost almost the middle is good 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.480
 will be for drinking 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.540
 already somewhere in the end of August in the middle 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.440
 September we the more he will stand 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.739
 the end of the year reporting that is somewhere to 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.600
 June, he will be generally gorgeous then 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.630
 eat it will be the perfect drink which 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.880
 you can go there 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.220
 tea should be last year's desirable 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.200
 yes that is the best option rule 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.209
 stored before and correctly necessarily 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.580
 page that is, it should be stored 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.739
 necessarily hermetically 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.140
 hermetically sealed glass jars 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.480
 best option either specialized 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.030
 packaging, that is, it is desirable that it 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.800
 was metallized foil in 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.540
 In this case , save tea 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.989
 all their best qualities and properties 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.450
 besides inside 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.330
 in a package in such a good package 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.750
 happens before fermentation ie 2 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.690
 comment which gives it already 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.060
 final here is this rounded fruit 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.209
 same cyrus with notes of prunes sometimes 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.979
 dried apple with characteristic floral 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.960
 sometimes the flavor all depends on 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.810
 where the part is assembled in what area 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.970
 on the field in the forest 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.500
 Well, naturally about how to collect it 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.950
 under the ice or 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:41.710
 the roadside is not talking about it mini there 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:47.590
 coupe boy it's not on 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:51.690
 it is clear wow that's all 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.960
 quite a long and difficult process 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.210
 turns out to be quite weary 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.070
 quite tiresome i'm shooting here i'm 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.380
 I say we spent the whole day and he 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.980
 not yet ended was not possible 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.920
 for this not yet worked physically yes 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:13.270
 we just watched how people work i 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.300
 I want to emphasize here is how our resume 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.550
 today's filming work 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.900
 that this is not an easy task 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.910
 difficult thing to do is create this one 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.470
 amazing drink 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.710
 I repeat once again that we are very happy 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.630
 if this drink turns out to do 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.540
 others we will be happy to share 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.870
 some secrets with manufacturers and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:42.120
 Of course we are waiting for interest from 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:47.730
