so in this room that's this new with a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.250 
so in this room that's this new with a
crack<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.270> fresh<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.990> make<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
crack that's fresh I can make it

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.930 
crack that's fresh I can make it
basically<00:02:04.980> go<00:02:05.190> away<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.730> like<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
doesn't exist it's not going to come

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.350 
doesn't exist it's not going to come
open<00:02:07.530> again<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.070> then<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> other<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.210> other

really really affect the sound it just
had<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> crack<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.540> no<00:02:21.959> in<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.170> case<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.770> had<00:02:23.070> to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
had a crack and no in this case I had to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100 
had a crack and no in this case I had to
take<00:02:23.370> out<00:02:23.550> what's<00:02:24.270> called<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.570> bass<00:02:24.780> bar

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
take out what's called the bass bar

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.870 
take out what's called the bass bar
because<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> crack<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:26.010> very<00:02:26.220> close<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
because the crack was very close to it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.030 
because the crack was very close to it
and<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.810> able<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.959> get<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.590> close<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and to be able to get in and close the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.100 
and to be able to get in and close the
crack<00:02:29.190> correctly<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.209> then<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.510> reinforce<00:02:30.930> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
crack correctly and then to reinforce it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.530 
crack correctly and then to reinforce it
correctly<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.680> had<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.610> remove<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> base<00:02:33.300> bar

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.440

which<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.870> very<00:02:34.350> simple<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.830> replace<00:02:35.300> but<00:02:36.300> it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
which is very simple to replace but it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:52.539 
which is very simple to replace but it
