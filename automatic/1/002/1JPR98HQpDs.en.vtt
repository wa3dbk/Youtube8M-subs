core<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.449> then<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:36.989> get

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
core right up and then that would get

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.689 
core right up and then that would get
thrown<00:00:37.379> away<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:38.220> if<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.400> was<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
thrown away now if I was going to

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.759 
thrown away now if I was going to

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.540 
drop it in boiling water for about 30
seconds<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.900> then<00:00:49.470> I<00:00:49.530> would<00:00:49.769> pull<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.220> out<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
seconds and then I would pull it out and
plunge<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.269> into<00:00:51.390> ice<00:00:51.600> water<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.589> skin

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
plunge it into ice water and the skin

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.430 
plunge it into ice water and the skin
will<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.040> peel<00:00:53.430> off<00:00:53.519> that's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.659> big<00:00:54.870> setup<00:00:55.170> if

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
blades that really cut through the skin

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.090 
blades that really cut through the skin
of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> tomato<00:01:08.340> nicely<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.070> to

and pull the skin off a lot of people
ask<00:01:23.260> well<00:01:23.440> why<00:01:23.590> are<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.800> taking<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.280> skin<00:01:24.550> off

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
ask well why are you taking the skin off

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.000 
ask well why are you taking the skin off
the<00:01:25.600> skin<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.080> tomato<00:01:26.230> does<00:01:26.740> have<00:01:26.950> a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
the skin of the tomato does have a

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.820 
the skin of the tomato does have a
little<00:01:27.310> bit<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.670> bitterness<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:29.140> but<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
little bit of bitterness to it but the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.040 
little bit of bitterness to it but the
main<00:01:30.040> reason<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.670> if<00:01:30.970> I'm<00:01:31.210> dicing<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.720> tomato

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
main reason is if I'm dicing a tomato

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.160 
main reason is if I'm dicing a tomato
for<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.410> recipe<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:33.490> skin<00:01:34.060> may<00:01:34.300> come<00:01:34.630> off<00:01:34.870> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
for a recipe that skin may come off and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.890 
for a recipe that skin may come off and
float<00:01:35.950> around<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.520> sauce<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:37.420> don't<00:01:37.479> I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
float around in the sauce and I don't I

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.420 
float around in the sauce and I don't I
don't<00:01:38.080> want<00:01:38.410> that<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.740> happen<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.100> we're<00:01:39.340> going

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
don't want that to happen so we're going

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.990 
don't want that to happen so we're going
to<00:01:39.520> take<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.910> skin<00:01:40.180> off<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
to take the skin off just like that and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.180 
to take the skin off just like that and
now<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.180> skin<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.720> could<00:01:43.810> throw<00:01:44.020> away<00:01:44.290> now<00:01:45.130> we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
now the skin you could throw away now we

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.840 
now the skin you could throw away now we
have<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.790> seed<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.869> tomato<00:01:47.229> so<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:48.430> don't<00:01:48.670> want
