00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.380
 after his Christian goal poker 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.029
 Ronaldo appeared before the media to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.309
 explain the great performance of the real 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.780
 madrid this Tuesday before elche third 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.810
 consecutive game in which the team 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.880
 by carlo ancelotti scores 5 more goals 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.180
 very well the truth is that the streets are 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.360
 coming out well the team is also in 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.310
 a moment we are winning the 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.189
 matches are the two of the league 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.509
 the champions also and it is necessary to mark 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.699
 score goals with a good run and I'm 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.230
 very happy the truth that they are changes and 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.020
 friendship made changes because the team 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.940
 some players need to rest 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.250
 and it seemed right to me that it is not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 the position that I'm used to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.810
 play but he has done well me and forward 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 we both did things well for that 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.090
 I'm happy and I feel ready 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 to do when necessary two of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930
 the news in Madrid's eleven 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.520
 keylor navas and claw with Ã¡lvaro 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 arbeloa that came out in the second half 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.210
 they also talked about the incontestable 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 Team victory set after 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.040
 get ahead on the team scoreboard 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.040
 ilicitano 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.820
 we're doing a lot of goals and that's 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 what we always want in the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.870
 team of players with a lot of level with 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.250
 much quality in any play can 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.410
 make a goal and I think that what 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.300
 we need goals to win games 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.590
 I think I play quite a lot living like 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.390
 like all the team that we have played 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 pretty good despite starting 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.890
 losing but well I say I 'm not going was 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.810
 for those of us who do not play regularly 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.370
 important to play well and well I think 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.890
 how much of xisco me and the others 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.680
 courses I think we've played a lot 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.240
 well it is important to always win as 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.160
 by how many more goals better 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.660
 for the people who come to see us but 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.360
 We are happy with how we are 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.670
 playing soccer I think every day 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.320
 let's get better today we have changed the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.000
 system among people as history 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.340
 really that they have done really well 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 and I think that 's the important thing to see 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 other days that maybe we are not so 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.520
 successful goal but if we maintain 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 the level of play then surely 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 they will win many matches
