little<00:03:54.069> darker<00:03:55.000> black<00:03:55.390> areas<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.290> there's

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
little darker black areas and there's

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.309 
little darker black areas and there's
even<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.770> wider<00:03:56.980> area<00:03:57.130> right<00:03:57.700> there<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:59.230> you

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
even a wider area right there but you

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:06.990 
even a wider area right there but you
can<00:03:59.470> see<00:03:59.590> all<00:03:59.709> these<00:03:59.890> dark<00:04:00.310> splotches

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.240 

now<00:04:07.540> look<00:04:07.780> at<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.020> side<00:04:08.260> with<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:09.040> wood

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
now look at the side with the wood

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.610 
now look at the side with the wood
conditioner<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.780> nearly<00:04:11.110> as<00:04:11.260> bad

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
conditioner and it's not nearly as bad

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.000 
conditioner and it's not nearly as bad
there<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.370> some<00:04:12.610> dark<00:04:13.450> swatching<00:04:14.170> one<00:04:14.830> on

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
there is some dark swatching one on

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.830 
there is some dark swatching one on
there<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.920> think<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:19.030> will<00:04:19.330> provide<00:04:19.780> a

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
there but I think this will provide a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.350 
there but I think this will provide a
much<00:04:20.110> better<00:04:20.410> result<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.670> I<00:04:22.000> think<00:04:22.090> I've

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
much better result so I think I've

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.820 
much better result so I think I've
decided<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.840> go<00:04:23.050> ahead<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.380> put<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.560> wood

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
decided to go ahead and put a wood

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.860 
decided to go ahead and put a wood
conditioner<00:04:24.040> all<00:04:24.730> over<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.180> toilet<00:04:25.330> cabinet

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
conditioner all over the toilet cabinet

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.790 
conditioner all over the toilet cabinet
prior<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:27.010> fitting<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.490> finish
