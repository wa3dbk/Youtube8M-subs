I<00:01:38.550> know<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.880> hard<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> visualize<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
I know it's hard to visualize but it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.540 
I know it's hard to visualize but it
will<00:01:40.410> be<00:01:40.590> easier<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> show<00:01:41.069> you<00:01:41.280> when
