 footage I make with the motherboard 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.559
 intel and for 67 b 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.410
 I find this image showing the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.119
 butterfly three rounds said he is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 then catalyst 13.1 hd video card 79 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.340
 70 8 gb of memory the game rotate in it with 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.690
 a screen just like you can see it's all 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.530
 world resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.940
 turn off or vertical 5 for power is 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 increase fps 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:55.070
 here you can see 121 fps 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.070
 I'll enter the game here on the keyboard. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:13.380
 you can see 81 % 98% of use and the course 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.189
 is 84 advice memory usage 1658 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.400
 megas and a fps 121 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:26.369
 At that moment I'm using bios to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:32.549
 ghz version that does to 79 70 roll instead 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:36.810
 of 925 mega rs she voted in 1,051 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.640
 memory clock instead of 1,375 a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.119
 1,500 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.119

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.560
 I was killed barely two minutinhos 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.440
 the boy of 88 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.670
 is a minimum of 80 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.400
 As you do not have much patience getting 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.400
 so none 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:12.560
 ai average crowd of 120 faith is seen already 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:18.650
 is always 18 not to fall into either 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.669
 well but as 60 is very good feast 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.940
