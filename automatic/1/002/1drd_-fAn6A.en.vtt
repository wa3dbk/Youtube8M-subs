weren't<00:00:11.880> working<00:00:12.210> correctly<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.870> I've<00:00:13.710> read

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
weren't working correctly and I've read

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.000 
weren't working correctly and I've read
online<00:00:15.440> but<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.529> particular<00:00:16.619> issue

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
online but this particular issue

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.349 
online but this particular issue
sometimes<00:00:17.340> horn<00:00:17.789> doesn't<00:00:18.150> work<00:00:18.240> correctly

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
sometimes horn doesn't work correctly

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.460 
sometimes horn doesn't work correctly
maybe<00:00:21.359> some<00:00:21.570> other<00:00:21.720> stuff<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.990> can't<00:00:22.230> remember

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
maybe some other stuff I can't remember

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.450 
maybe some other stuff I can't remember
for<00:00:22.560> sure<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> problem<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
for sure but what the problem and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.670 
for sure but what the problem and
adducts<00:00:26.460> spring<00:00:26.789> which<00:00:27.570> um<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.199> old<00:00:28.349> clock

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
adducts spring which um is the old clock

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.290 
adducts spring which um is the old clock
spring<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> actually<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
spring right here this is actually the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.139 
spring right here this is actually the
device<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> wiring<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.669> goes

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
device and this is the wiring that goes

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.910 
device and this is the wiring that goes
into<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.510> box<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.170> new<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.649> comes

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
into little box that a new one comes

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.950 
into little box that a new one comes
with<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.630> takes<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
with and what it is is it takes the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.389 
with and what it is is it takes the
wiring<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:39.000> steering<00:00:39.600> wheel<00:00:39.840> buttons

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
wiring from the steering wheel buttons

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
wiring from the steering wheel buttons
and<00:00:41.510> here's<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> new<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.469> wiring

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and here's the new one and the wiring

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
and here's the new one and the wiring
comes<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> allows<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.030> wiring<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
comes in and allows the wiring not to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.630 
comes in and allows the wiring not to
get<00:00:45.690> wrapped<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.289> us<00:00:47.039> spin<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> steering

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
get wrapped up as us spin the steering

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.580 
get wrapped up as us spin the steering
wheel<00:00:47.789> around

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
wheel around

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.709 
wheel around
apparently<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:49.739> only<00:00:50.340> Ford<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.390> sell<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
apparently I'm only Ford can sell you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.930 
apparently I'm only Ford can sell you
this<00:00:51.840> part<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:52.770> 150<00:00:53.460> bucks<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.910> now

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this part it's about 150 bucks right now

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.770 
this part it's about 150 bucks right now
here<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> April<00:00:54.480> 2011<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:56.629> yeah<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> guess

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here in April 2011 and yeah I guess

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.209 
here in April 2011 and yeah I guess
there's<00:00:58.020> no<00:00:58.140> aftermarket<00:00:58.710> items<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> did

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there's no aftermarket items I did

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.920 
there's no aftermarket items I did
pretty<00:01:00.180> exhaustive<00:01:00.690> search<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.550> order<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
pretty exhaustive search so in order to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
pretty exhaustive search so in order to
replace<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.339> what<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
replace it what you have to do is the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.310 
replace it what you have to do is the
first<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> supposed<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
first thing I supposed to do is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.090 
first thing I supposed to do is
disconnect<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> battery<00:01:08.460> apparently<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.100> if

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
disconnect the battery apparently the if

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
disconnect the battery apparently the if
there's<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.400> electricity<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.210> could<00:01:12.330> actually

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
there's an electricity it could actually

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.380 
there's an electricity it could actually
discharge<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.979> airbag<00:01:14.460> which<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
discharge the airbag which is a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.850 
discharge the airbag which is a
obviously<00:01:16.140> something<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
obviously something you don't want to do

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.429 
obviously something you don't want to do
while<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.369> doing<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> repair<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
while you're doing the repair so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.190 
while you're doing the repair so
underneath<00:01:19.909> if<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.060> remember<00:01:21.420> correctly<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> had

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
underneath if I remember correctly I had

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980 
underneath if I remember correctly I had
to<00:01:22.290> remove<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.740> plastic<00:01:23.009> panel<00:01:23.810> which<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
to remove this plastic panel which is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.490 
to remove this plastic panel which is
down<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
down here I think was just to you know a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.010 
down here I think was just to you know a
couple<00:01:28.680> bolts<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.689> remember

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
couple bolts and then if I remember

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
couple bolts and then if I remember
right<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.610> removed<00:01:32.610> some<00:01:32.670> other<00:01:32.850> things<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.329> his

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
right I removed some other things on his

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.170 
right I removed some other things on his
truck<00:01:33.750> troubleshooting<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.939> there's<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
truck troubleshooting this but there's a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.539 
truck troubleshooting this but there's a
couple<00:01:36.329> plastic<00:01:36.930> connectors<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.310> yeah

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
couple plastic connectors they were yeah

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
couple plastic connectors they were yeah
you<00:01:39.090> pull<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.479> pin<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:39.990> then

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you pull this little pin out and then

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.710 
you pull this little pin out and then
you<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> connector<00:01:42.360> comes<00:01:42.540> out

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you know that the connector comes out

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
you know that the connector comes out
easier<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.799> also<00:01:44.159> around<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.970> steering

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
easier and then also around the steering

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
easier and then also around the steering
column<00:01:45.420> itself<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.950> remove<00:01:47.220> two

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
column itself I'm going to remove two

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.940 
column itself I'm going to remove two
screws<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.500> plastic

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
screws here and then these plastic

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.480 
screws here and then these plastic
pieces<00:01:49.979> came<00:01:50.460> off<00:01:51.860> apparently<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
pieces came off apparently I think I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.190 
pieces came off apparently I think I
needed<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> pop<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.509> guy<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.079> -<00:01:55.520> I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
needed to pop this guy out of here - I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.300 
needed to pop this guy out of here - I
think<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.380> pretty<00:01:58.560> easy<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> figure<00:01:59.189> out

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
think it was pretty easy to figure out

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
think it was pretty easy to figure out
you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.390> there's<00:02:00.680> little<00:02:01.680> clips<00:02:01.920> on

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
you can see that there's little clips on

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.730 
you can see that there's little clips on
there<00:02:02.840> but<00:02:03.840> once<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:06.500> there<00:02:07.500> was

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
there but once you do that and there was

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160 
there but once you do that and there was
these<00:02:08.729> got<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:09.660> another<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
these got there's another one on the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
these got there's another one on the
other<00:02:10.229> side<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.860> little<00:02:11.190> plastic<00:02:11.760> door<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
other side a little plastic door that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.470 
other side a little plastic door that
you<00:02:12.420> open<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.959> then<00:02:13.110> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
you open up and then you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.740 
you open up and then you
remove<00:02:14.250> two<00:02:15.250> little<00:02:15.819> bolt<00:02:16.030> things<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.629> then

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
remove two little bolt things and then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.710 
remove two little bolt things and then
you<00:02:17.319> can<00:02:17.349> actually<00:02:17.769> take<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.940> airbag<00:02:19.360> cover

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you can actually take the airbag cover

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.259 
you can actually take the airbag cover
off<00:02:20.580> same<00:02:21.580> thing<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.849> got<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.120> careful

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
off same thing you got to be careful

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.990 
off same thing you got to be careful
with<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.599> guess<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:23.440> be<00:02:23.470> discharged

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
with it I guess it can be discharged

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.250 
with it I guess it can be discharged
probably<00:02:25.000> seeing<00:02:25.239> YouTube<00:02:25.599> videos<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.140> people

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
probably seeing YouTube videos of people

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.410 
probably seeing YouTube videos of people
playing<00:02:26.409> jokes<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:26.920> other<00:02:27.040> people<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.580> when

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
playing jokes and other people but when

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.330 
playing jokes and other people but when
it<00:02:28.510> discharges<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.049> pretty<00:02:29.290> powerful<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.250> you

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
it discharges is pretty powerful and you

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.820 
it discharges is pretty powerful and you
can<00:02:30.489> see<00:02:30.670> there's<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> little<00:02:31.709> connector<00:02:32.709> on

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
can see there's a little connector on

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.580 
can see there's a little connector on
there<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.629> that's<00:02:34.629> what<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:34.989> connected<00:02:35.440> on

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
there and that's what this connected on

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.619 
there and that's what this connected on
to<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:37.360> have<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.769> slide<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:39.629> yellow

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
to so you have to slide this yellow

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.890 
to so you have to slide this yellow
thing<00:02:40.920> back<00:02:41.920> down<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.700> then<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.360> can<00:02:43.750> get

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
thing back down and then I can get

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.720 
thing back down and then I can get
pulled<00:02:44.170> right<00:02:44.440> off<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.069> remember<00:02:45.340> right

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
pulled right off if I remember right

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
pulled right off if I remember right
after<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:48.519> need<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> disconnect<00:02:49.920> little

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
after that you need to disconnect little

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.880 
after that you need to disconnect little
wires<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:52.209> go<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:53.250> both<00:02:54.250> sides<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.180> buttons

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
wires that go to both sides of buttons

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.190 
wires that go to both sides of buttons
then<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.099> use<00:02:57.459> Torx<00:02:57.849> bit<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.510> remove<00:02:58.840> are

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
then you use Torx bit and you remove are

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.680 
then you use Torx bit and you remove are
you<00:02:59.829> actually<00:03:00.340> almost<00:03:00.700> completely<00:03:01.450> removed

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
you actually almost completely removed

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.949 
you actually almost completely removed
not<00:03:01.870> completely<00:03:02.319> these<00:03:03.220> four<00:03:03.489> guys

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
not completely these four guys

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.960 
not completely these four guys
disconnect<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:05.260> wire<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:06.609> then<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.790> take

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
disconnect this wire and then you take

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.220 
disconnect this wire and then you take
that<00:03:07.000> off<00:03:07.329> that's<00:03:08.019> your<00:03:08.230> horn<00:03:08.849> button<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:10.230> if

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
that off that's your horn button and if

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
that off that's your horn button and if
you<00:03:11.379> remove<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.650> all<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> way<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
you remove that all the way then the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.720 
you remove that all the way then the
assembly<00:03:13.390> actually<00:03:13.780> will<00:03:14.440> fall<00:03:14.680> apart<00:03:15.069> you

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
assembly actually will fall apart you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.280 
assembly actually will fall apart you
don't<00:03:16.120> really<00:03:16.269> want<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.599> remove<00:03:16.870> those<00:03:17.019> all

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
don't really want to remove those all

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.879 
don't really want to remove those all
the<00:03:17.379> way<00:03:17.500> out<00:03:18.000> after<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.620> actual

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
the way out after that this is actual

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.190 
the way out after that this is actual
word<00:03:20.980> you've<00:03:21.130> got<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> little<00:03:21.489> bit<00:03:21.609> difficult

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
word you've got a little bit difficult

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.270 
word you've got a little bit difficult

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
and you know anytime you have to use a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.190 
and you know anytime you have to use a
polar<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:26.889> sometimes<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:29.109> know

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
polar you know it's sometimes you know

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.140 
polar you know it's sometimes you know
it's<00:03:29.349> hard<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.560> remove<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.950> item<00:03:30.220> but<00:03:30.970> I'm

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
it's hard to remove the item but I'm

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.860 
it's hard to remove the item but I'm
loosening<00:03:32.139> this<00:03:32.760> Torx<00:03:33.760> bit<00:03:33.970> bulb<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:34.540> holds

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
loosening this Torx bit bulb that holds

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.589 
loosening this Torx bit bulb that holds
the<00:03:34.989> steering<00:03:35.290> wheel<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.180> actually<00:03:37.180> put

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
the steering wheel on and actually put

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.890 
the steering wheel on and actually put
then<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.930> put<00:03:38.109> up<00:03:38.200> polar<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:40.120> held<00:03:40.480> onto<00:03:40.660> right

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
then I put up polar that held onto right

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.039 
then I put up polar that held onto right
here<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.470> right<00:03:42.310> here<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.750> end<00:03:43.900> up<00:03:44.019> using

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
here and right here and I end up using

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.870 
here and right here and I end up using
my<00:03:44.530> impact<00:03:45.489> wrench<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:47.290> give<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.620> good<00:03:47.880> snap

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
my impact wrench to give it a good snap

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.479 
my impact wrench to give it a good snap
to<00:03:49.150> pull<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.480> guy<00:03:49.690> off<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.280> will<00:03:51.280> actually

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
to pull that guy off I will actually

00:03:51.489 --> 00:04:03.780 
to pull that guy off I will actually
show<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:53.549> polar<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:55.000> used

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.420 

I<00:04:09.239> think<00:04:10.239> this<00:04:10.390> was<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.599> one<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.079> use

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
I think this was the one that I use

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.920 
I think this was the one that I use
something<00:04:12.430> along<00:04:12.819> these<00:04:13.000> lines<00:04:13.060> yeah<00:04:13.840> I'm

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
something along these lines yeah I'm

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.539 
something along these lines yeah I'm
almost<00:04:14.140> sure<00:04:14.379> that's<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:15.359> is<00:04:16.359> what<00:04:16.509> I<00:04:16.539> use<00:04:20.549> see

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
almost sure that's it is what I use see

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.270 
almost sure that's it is what I use see
a<00:04:21.579> little<00:04:21.850> collection<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.389> Polar's<00:04:22.660> there<00:04:22.870> and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
a little collection of Polar's there and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.540 
a little collection of Polar's there and
then<00:04:25.530> once<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:27.120> broke<00:04:28.120> loose<00:04:28.449> then<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.979> took

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
then once that broke loose then I took

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.279 
then once that broke loose then I took
the<00:04:30.729> puller<00:04:30.910> off<00:04:31.120> remove<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.900> bolt<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
the puller off remove this bolt the

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.939 
the puller off remove this bolt the
steering<00:04:32.590> wheel<00:04:32.710> popped<00:04:32.979> right<00:04:33.250> off<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.759> then

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
steering wheel popped right off and then

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.159 
steering wheel popped right off and then
you're<00:04:35.949> basically<00:04:36.400> almost<00:04:36.639> done<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.449> terms<00:04:37.960> of

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
you're basically almost done in terms of

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.499 
you're basically almost done in terms of
removing<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.889> clock<00:04:39.190> spring<00:04:39.669> it's<00:04:40.509> just<00:04:40.870> a

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
removing the clock spring it's just a

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.129 
removing the clock spring it's just a
couple<00:04:43.509> little<00:04:44.070> metal<00:04:45.070> plastic<00:04:45.310> guys<00:04:46.110> kind<00:04:47.110> of

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
couple little metal plastic guys kind of

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.439 
couple little metal plastic guys kind of
right<00:04:47.259> there<00:04:47.410> in<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.560> middle<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.889> screen

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
right there in the middle of the screen

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.810 
right there in the middle of the screen
there's<00:04:49.449> three<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.930> them<00:04:50.139> and<00:04:50.580> once<00:04:51.580> you

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
there's three of them and once you

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.930 
there's three of them and once you
unstamped<00:04:52.449> those<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:54.070> actually<00:04:54.460> comes<00:04:54.729> off<00:04:54.880> of

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
unstamped those it actually comes off of

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.920 
unstamped those it actually comes off of
the<00:04:56.130> turning<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:59.530> turn<00:04:59.770> signal<00:05:00.190> assembly<00:05:00.669> and

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
the turning the turn signal assembly and

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.420 
the turning the turn signal assembly and
that<00:05:01.930> whole<00:05:02.139> assembly<00:05:02.259> actually<00:05:02.919> just<00:05:03.130> comes

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
that whole assembly actually just comes

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.730 
that whole assembly actually just comes
right<00:05:03.729> off<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.720> steering<00:05:05.020> column<00:05:05.139> it's<00:05:05.470> it

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
right off the steering column it's it

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.370 
right off the steering column it's it
just<00:05:06.009> snaps<00:05:06.340> right<00:05:06.520> off<00:05:06.580> it's<00:05:06.849> really<00:05:06.910> easy

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
just snaps right off it's really easy

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.670 
just snaps right off it's really easy
it's<00:05:08.380> it's<00:05:08.650> self-explanatory<00:05:08.979> so<00:05:09.580> once<00:05:09.940> you

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
it's it's self-explanatory so once you

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.000 
it's it's self-explanatory so once you
put<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.860> new<00:05:12.010> clock<00:05:12.460> spring<00:05:12.789> on<00:05:13.180> there<00:05:13.930> oh<00:05:14.199> and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
put the new clock spring on there oh and

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.779 
put the new clock spring on there oh and
you<00:05:15.099> also<00:05:15.130> have<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:16.740> remove<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.750> little<00:05:19.750> box

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
you also have to remove the little box

you also have to remove the little box
from<00:05:21.789> underneath<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.300> steering<00:05:22.510> column<00:05:22.780> it's

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
from underneath the steering column it's

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.820 
from underneath the steering column it's
actually<00:05:24.220> a<00:05:24.250> light<00:05:24.909> on<00:05:25.030> this<00:05:25.150> yeah<00:05:25.590> it's<00:05:26.590> right

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
actually a light on this yeah it's right

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.680 
actually a light on this yeah it's right
there<00:05:27.130> there's<00:05:27.699> actually<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.090> button<00:05:28.449> if<00:05:28.570> you

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
there there's actually a button if you

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.290 
there there's actually a button if you
push<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.199> you<00:05:29.949> can<00:05:30.130> pretty<00:05:30.280> much<00:05:30.400> just<00:05:30.550> UNPO

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
push this you can pretty much just UNPO

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.980 
push this you can pretty much just UNPO
it<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.690> pull<00:05:32.289> it<00:05:32.409> out<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:34.270> was<00:05:34.599> pretty<00:05:34.750> easy

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
it and pull it out it was pretty easy

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.719 
it and pull it out it was pretty easy
and<00:05:35.289> then<00:05:35.320> there's<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.800> couple<00:05:36.310> of<00:05:36.430> wires<00:05:36.580> that

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
and then there's a couple of wires that

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.170 
and then there's a couple of wires that
you<00:05:36.940> have<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.180> disconnect<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:39.030> plugging<00:05:40.030> the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
you have to disconnect so plugging the

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.439 
you have to disconnect so plugging the
new<00:05:40.300> wires<00:05:40.919> slide<00:05:41.919> that<00:05:42.099> puppy<00:05:42.400> in<00:05:42.580> there<00:05:42.820> you

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
new wires slide that puppy in there you

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.399 
new wires slide that puppy in there you
know<00:05:43.539> you'll<00:05:43.720> see<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.050> there's<00:05:44.229> a<00:05:44.289> few

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
know you'll see that there's a few

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.570 
know you'll see that there's a few
connectors<00:05:44.889> here<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.250> there<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.460> you'll

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
connectors here and there that you'll

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.250 
connectors here and there that you'll
have<00:05:45.760> to<00:05:45.909> connect<00:05:46.210> but<00:05:46.449> it's<00:05:46.570> all<00:05:47.020> really

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
have to connect but it's all really

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.600 
have to connect but it's all really
self-explanatory<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:48.599> then<00:05:50.340> feed<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.430> wires

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
self-explanatory and then feed the wires

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.830 
self-explanatory and then feed the wires
through<00:05:51.729> the<00:05:51.820> string<00:05:52.060> well<00:05:52.270> put<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.630> steering

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
through the string well put the steering

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.260 
through the string well put the steering
wheel<00:05:52.930> back<00:05:53.139> on<00:05:53.199> oh<00:05:53.620> one<00:05:54.250> detail<00:05:54.669> I<00:05:54.699> did<00:05:54.940> forget

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
wheel back on oh one detail I did forget

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.890 
wheel back on oh one detail I did forget
the<00:05:55.810> new<00:05:55.930> clock<00:05:56.199> spring<00:05:56.470> does<00:05:56.800> come<00:05:57.840> with<00:05:58.840> a

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
the new clock spring does come with a

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.399 
the new clock spring does come with a
plastic<00:05:59.380> lock<00:05:59.919> on<00:06:00.130> it<00:06:00.419> don't<00:06:01.419> remove<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:02.130> so<00:06:04.409> it

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
plastic lock on it don't remove it so it

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.860 
plastic lock on it don't remove it so it
snaps<00:06:05.650> into<00:06:06.099> here<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.870> kind<00:06:07.990> of<00:06:08.139> holds<00:06:08.560> the

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
snaps into here and it kind of holds the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.540 
snaps into here and it kind of holds the
you<00:06:10.870> know<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.080> the<00:06:11.590> pieces<00:06:12.010> together<00:06:12.190> keep

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
you know the the pieces together keep

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.399 
you know the the pieces together keep
them<00:06:12.639> from<00:06:12.729> spinning<00:06:13.000> around<00:06:13.150> before<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:14.139> put

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
them from spinning around before you put

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:15.570 
them from spinning around before you put
the<00:06:14.500> steering<00:06:14.740> wheel<00:06:14.950> on<00:06:15.070> is<00:06:15.279> when<00:06:15.490> you

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
the steering wheel on is when you

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.890 
the steering wheel on is when you
actually

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
actually

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.260 
actually
just<00:06:17.169> pull<00:06:17.410> that<00:06:17.440> right<00:06:17.590> off<00:06:17.910> so<00:06:18.910> put<00:06:19.180> the

just pull that right off so put the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.210 
just pull that right off so put the
steering<00:06:19.479> wheel<00:06:19.600> on<00:06:19.720> and<00:06:20.710> actually<00:06:20.979> that's<00:06:21.040> as

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
steering wheel on and actually that's as

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.580 
steering wheel on and actually that's as
far<00:06:21.370> as<00:06:21.430> I've<00:06:21.669> gotten<00:06:21.910> but<00:06:22.720> I'm<00:06:22.930> really<00:06:23.169> you
