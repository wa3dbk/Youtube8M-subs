 legends more or less that 's the one I'm 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.119
 playing briqa then that's why I 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 I decided to buy the part that the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.880
 design is very beautiful and apart here at 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 side has 12 buttons that are totally 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 configurable then and good 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 I can probably serve then 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.540
 let's go to see it let's do the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.950
 small in boxing see is not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 totally new and good here has 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.800
 some specifications that says that it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.960
 you can change the color of the buttons is 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.250
 totally color you can put the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.899
 combination of colors that you want 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.480
 although it has 20 million 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.500
 combinations then bitch there is a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.449
 shit of ways to put color 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.739
 it also has the durability the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.079
 durability have it here according to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.760
 you have for 20 million clicks and that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.160
 you can travel like this with the mouse sorry 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.830
 with the cable that cable is that of the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.780
 microphone then do not worry about the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.000
 cable were 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.979
 You can travel with the mouse 250 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.530
 kilometers be in what slides it what 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.330
 can use 250 kilometers is the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.740
 durability and 20 million clicks 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.750
 so I think I think it is 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.509
 enough in truth I do not know we're going to 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.880
 see what wave we're going to open the here of 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.909
 this side has the colors good 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.290
 They are one of the few colors of those that 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.970
 one of the many colors of those that 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.340
 you can configure and well have your 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.190
 software in which you can put the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.930
 different colors and let's open it I think 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.549
 which is here we are going to try to 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.320
 take off this good mother if you do not 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.330
 we cut appears we have the cutter 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 this wonderful putter then let's 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.409
 open it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.250
 I do not know if it's time here I have them 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.920
 from here to the mother if it does not exist 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.440
 the box the house is very beautiful has its 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.420
 velcro this the hair of forgiveness is 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.009
 unfocused by the movement of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.840
 anarchist in maybe the velcro the truth 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.840
 The box is very beautiful and when 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.880
 we make a little here to show you 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 the mouse plus the mouse is this 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.830
 right now obviously the buttons 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.180
 is not true color because this one does not 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 is connected and nothing then right now 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.120
 let's get him out of here this one 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.959
 box 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.310
 from this box to see how it is taken out because 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.280
 we have to pull this here that there 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.099
 let me see that here I believe that if I'm not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.950
 wrong here should be the instructive if 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.450
 an instructive and the guarantee like this is 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.680
 we're going to leave this around here no longer 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.650
 it serves 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.140
 well here we have 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.629
 is the guide is the instructive that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.150
 obviously we will not read only if 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.200
 we have some fart like good mexican and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 well here we have the guarantee guarantee 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.310
 today the support comes out that these are going to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.959
 leave it here the side that does not 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.069
 what interests us right now is 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.569
 the mouse the hardware then to see how 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.780
 it will open we will see how 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.780
 we open 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.360
 from here yes because we have what 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.540
 I think we have to 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.180
 pull it if we have to pull it up 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.350
 we have to get out of here and we have 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.060
 what 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.330
 that we have to pull him out of here 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.760
 lake and obviously this wireless mouse 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.320
 the truth for gaming of all 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.980
 magicians must be wired not to be 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.060
 wireless 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.519
 then the cable is too small to see the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.870
 cable the cable is not normal is not like 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.959
 this plastic is not like plastic 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.790
 normal of all the mice see is not like that 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.599
 it feels like web see it then but 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.660
 can be distinguished in focus is very very 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.980
 boy feels very cool to what boy 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.660
 feels and is the truth the mouse is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.360
 medium is a little heavy lion is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.329
 heavy t then I think it's very 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.770
 very cool is very pro for what he achieves 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.020
 they needed to remove the plastic 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.360
 and now here already we have 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.310
 plastic desks also for 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.650

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.259
 left an apology comes because the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.550

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.560
 making a box and a little crashed but 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.969
 I am devising to do us 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.620
 let's put it here so they can 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:52.770
 get it right is the scroll left click 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.159
 right click and this is the other button or 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.289
 this extra that has vital in your hand what 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.599
 we are going to put like this and we are going to occupy the 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.789
 ring finger which is this the middle finger and 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.650
 obviously the index finger comes out and with the 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.930
 thumb we're going to use the two 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.930
 engines here comes out that the truth is 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.900
 very this very well placed very well very 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.819
 precise since this one usually the finger 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.319
 we have it like this not placed and good that 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.090
 from here to the height then it's not going to 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.900
 have no problem and the mouse is 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.199
 heavy is the 600 model for those who 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.000
 ask is the model g 600 logitech the 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.349
 I really think the price is very good 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.560
 it is accessible 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:34.550
 it cost me 700 pesos exactly 700 pesos 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.279
 we are talking about some that 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.009
 65 63 over there dollars roughly 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.889
 approximately then the truth is 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.779
 very very pro this wave then we are going to 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.249

 was this the cable is totally 

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:55.649
 different everyone else and obviously 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.779
 the extra buttons you have to be able 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:59.610
