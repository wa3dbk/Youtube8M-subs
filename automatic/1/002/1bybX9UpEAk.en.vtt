00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.070
 find bargains and by 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.890
 against swine played ago 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.060
 really few exhibitors but it's 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.560
 as you empty lofts that's 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.050
 leave or double then what is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 start with there are a lot of games 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.390
 video is a little bit of d1 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 like from beezik 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 I found a big fluffy crash 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 so behind compared to the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.670
 size of my hand is the huge I would have 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.969
 favorite coconut crushes version and where she 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.289
 is nice I found them two euros 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.320
 that's not bad gold in my showcase 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.030
 special working ten drops 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 then I found small eds games 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.260
 except that one I found it apart 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.520
 but but look at me but gosh there 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.900
 frankly I do not understand them 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.010
 people 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 after the cartridge boring and in good condition 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.920
 it works but look at the state of a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.259
 picture 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 but how they do that they eat 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.630
 lorca makes their game box 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 Not possible 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 so I was able to reduce the price 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.950
 because it was out of the question 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.610
 I buy his flesh good play at 4 euros 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.290
 angry Birds 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.920
 it's still the most dakar 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.320
 alone but inadmissible the state 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 methane in addition that I do not even know a 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.799
 old game are you sure he had to buy 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.159
 six months ago and he's already pitiful 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.530
 state 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.600
 I bought these three games there for ten 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.549
 euros all complete be happy 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.159
 in super good condition it's still 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.690
 better than the state of the angry birds 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.110
 as this reminder is unfathomable 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.119
 what i found i found that one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.729

 now that I was doing a lot of 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.090
 review the secondary machine I should 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.440
 to make a little girl want to see if 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.210
 really it is as rotten as it lasts 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.060

 the mixer a little scratched by cons 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.280
 but I think it's the one that the 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.590
 colleagues at the sounds have most played the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.150
 20 euros the lot is a very good price 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.840

 who are watching this video 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.830
 what they do is silly and of course is 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.830
 what you see often decided album 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.600
 of metal I really see that too 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.479
 rarely and there I found a bunch 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.250
 of albums I believe for the walk 2 4 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.860

 very happy so we won 0.6 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.500

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.320
 that a music each the arrival I know 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.710

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.790
 the listened I'm wrong it's neo 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.670
 metal but art check to confirm we 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.860
 have to apologize for the metal 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.770

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.360

 for ropes in black sabbath 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.330
 so here we hit heavy titles 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.100
 the titles what I'm listening I have not 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.920
 too much to listen to black sabbath 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.490
 it's not too much my kind of metal there a 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.470
 other blue rausis but we have 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.760

 the jungle alaa good that's still 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.260
 the thrash metal of the good fat trash guy 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.520
 metal cdu / csu slayer and anna a clique 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.710

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.410
 but huge 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.640
 good there it's hard or not it's more 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.200
 known to disconnect the most known 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.210
 not even if we can put that as 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.990
 metal or independent marei 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.880
 manson there we have enough of the trash 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.030
 techni group metal I paint as elise 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.890
 call his machine head that's their 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.980
 first album just first three 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.110
 albums two very good bands besides 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.370
 liquid park good that we no longer present 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.720
 three liquid albums for example 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.060
 it's not metal that's rock 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.290
 that one is shame 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.280
 the team over an excellent album 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:11.280
 and on youth it's actually the 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.470
 first music from the first album ah 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.000
 shit I have smaller album in 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.210
 head and they did a little version 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.170
 techno and it's okay and it's a good one good 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.970
 a good mix 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.720
 I like it there are some music 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.370
 that they are really frankly 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.890
 excellent and Ontario go to one 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.990
 of the best known neo metal slipknot that 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.500
 the state and likÃ¨s is the tenth edition 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.510
 anniversary 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.400
 and that I'm happy to find her 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.070
 especially in this state close to new 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.570
 so the 12 metal albums between 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.289
 tiana quotation marks it's not my metal 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.020
 I think about the team per case 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:42.490
 10 euros that's all for this 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.659
 report empty attics that's true 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.300
 that albums and tells me it does not cost 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:48.159
 too expensive his brake sinister 2,3 euros 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.559
 ht port are you at 5 euros 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:53.379
 for a good music album be it 

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:56.409
 metal pop wrap that all genres that 

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:57.759
 you want and frankly but it's 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.990
 true that it's so rare to find 

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.279
 metal albums an empty granaries 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.830
 I was really happy to have found this 

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.759
 heavy and bad tower games for content 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.990
 to do my little empty granaries 

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.849
 champions full of things that kills 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.550
 fog there is nothing left in the bag to 

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:11.740
 doc this soul tube and so here I am 

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.149

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.149
