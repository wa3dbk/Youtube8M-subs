bad okay i'm at 13 bumps into it man
very<00:02:55.250> bad<00:02:56.170> momentum<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:58.180> physics<00:02:59.180> we're<00:02:59.600> not

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
very bad momentum and physics we're not

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.540 
very bad momentum and physics we're not
being<00:02:59.900> expected<00:03:00.260> should<00:03:00.920> have<00:03:01.070> bounced<00:03:01.430> off

being expected should have bounced off

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.930 
being expected should have bounced off
of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.940> demand<00:03:02.500> maybe<00:03:03.500> bounced<00:03:04.400> back<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
of the demand maybe bounced back and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.480 
of the demand maybe bounced back and
then<00:03:05.240> lost<00:03:05.480> belt<00:03:05.900> regain<00:03:06.650> his<00:03:06.770> balance<00:03:06.800> it's

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
then lost belt regain his balance it's

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.540 
then lost belt regain his balance it's
about<00:03:07.670> poetry<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:11.060> looks<00:03:11.390> very<00:03:11.510> our<00:03:11.900> Cajun

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
about poetry this looks very our Cajun

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.780 
about poetry this looks very our Cajun
getting<00:03:13.550> on<00:03:14.170> does<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.350> feel-good<00:03:15.560> yes<00:03:16.040> but
