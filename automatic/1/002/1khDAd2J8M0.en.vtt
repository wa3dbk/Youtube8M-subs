which of the following ordered pairs is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.549 
which of the following ordered pairs is
not<00:00:45.860> shown<00:00:46.220> on<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:46.520> graph<00:00:46.900> and<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:48.020> gives<00:00:48.230> us<00:00:48.350> a

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
not shown on the graph and it gives us a

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.799 
not shown on the graph and it gives us a
graph<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:49.730> gives<00:00:50.030> us<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.300> whole<00:00:50.480> bunch<00:00:50.510> of

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
graph it gives us a whole bunch of

graph it gives us a whole bunch of
ordered<00:00:51.199> pairs<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:53.350> let's<00:00:54.350> now<00:00:54.589> review<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
ordered pairs and let's now review the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.030 
ordered pairs and let's now review the
core<00:00:55.670> ideas<00:00:56.059> here<00:00:56.360> first<00:00:57.110> we're<00:00:57.680> given<00:00:57.949> a

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
core ideas here first we're given a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.579 
core ideas here first we're given a
graph<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:58.610> on<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.790> coordinate<00:00:59.390> grid<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.379> we're

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
graph it's on a coordinate grid so we're

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.270 
graph it's on a coordinate grid so we're
going<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.830> identify<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.370> x<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.659> y<00:01:02.690> axis<00:01:03.559> the

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
going to identify the x and a y axis the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.850 
going to identify the x and a y axis the
x<00:01:04.460> axis<00:01:05.089> we're<00:01:05.870> going<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.080> usually<00:01:06.500> consider

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
x axis we're going to usually consider

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.750 
x axis we're going to usually consider
the<00:01:07.100> horizontal<00:01:07.600> axis<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.870> y<00:01:09.610> is<00:01:10.610> going

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
the horizontal axis and the y is going

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.560 
the horizontal axis and the y is going
to<00:01:10.880> be<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.840> vertical<00:01:12.350> axis<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:14.060> X<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.540> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
to be the vertical axis so X is the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.260 
to be the vertical axis so X is the
horizontal<00:01:14.930> axis<00:01:15.740> sometimes<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.430> think<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.940> X

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
horizontal axis sometimes we think of X

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.590 
horizontal axis sometimes we think of X
our<00:01:17.540> horizontal<00:01:17.840> axis<00:01:18.260> as<00:01:19.270> our<00:01:20.270> input<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:23.030> we

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
our horizontal axis as our input and we

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.580 
our horizontal axis as our input and we
could<00:01:23.720> think<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.960> our<00:01:24.170> Y<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:24.890> our<00:01:25.159> output<00:01:26.590> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
could think of our Y as our output and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.670 
could think of our Y as our output and
then<00:01:27.979> if<00:01:28.070> we<00:01:28.189> get<00:01:28.310> more<00:01:28.930> more<00:01:29.930> advanced<00:01:30.469> you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
then if we get more more advanced you

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.740 
then if we get more more advanced you
know<00:01:30.710> we'll<00:01:30.979> think<00:01:31.009> of<00:01:31.340> X<00:01:31.549> as<00:01:31.729> our<00:01:31.880> domain<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
know we'll think of X as our domain and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.840 
know we'll think of X as our domain and
we'll<00:01:33.049> think<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.350> Y<00:01:33.530> as<00:01:33.560> our<00:01:33.979> range<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:34.670> for

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
we'll think of Y as our range but for

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.300 
we'll think of Y as our range but for
now<00:01:34.969> just<00:01:35.000> think<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.539> X<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.200> what<00:01:36.320> X<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.890> input

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
now just think of X and what X is input

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.929 
now just think of X and what X is input
Y<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:37.820> output<00:01:38.950> then<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:39.979> have<00:01:40.340> these<00:01:40.520> points

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
Y is output then we have these points

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.130 
Y is output then we have these points
that<00:01:41.390> are<00:01:42.229> on<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.530> graph<00:01:42.859> I<00:01:43.299> want<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.450> find

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
that are on this graph I want to find

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.170 
that are on this graph I want to find
the<00:01:45.259> ordered<00:01:45.680> pairs<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:46.340> means<00:01:46.640> how<00:01:46.909> would<00:01:47.090> I

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
the ordered pairs that means how would I

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.990 
the ordered pairs that means how would I
how<00:01:47.390> would<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.630> name<00:01:47.899> this<00:01:48.140> point<00:01:48.759> well<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.880> way

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
how would I name this point well the way

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.749 
how would I name this point well the way
you<00:01:50.060> do<00:01:50.329> ordered<00:01:50.780> pairs<00:01:51.079> is<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:52.280> first<00:01:52.579> you

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
you do ordered pairs is you first you

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.749 
you do ordered pairs is you first you
identify<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.270> X<00:01:53.630> input<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.799> Y<00:01:54.979> output<00:01:55.250> so

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
identify the X input and the Y output so

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.370 
identify the X input and the Y output so
here<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.420> go<00:01:57.109> over<00:01:57.500> looks<00:01:57.740> around<00:01:58.070> 3<00:01:58.960> 3<00:01:59.960> for<00:02:00.170> X

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
here I go over looks around 3 3 for X

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.010 
here I go over looks around 3 3 for X
and<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.850> go<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.320> 4<00:02:03.320> for<00:02:03.679> y<00:02:04.179> so<00:02:05.179> this<00:02:05.329> point<00:02:05.719> here<00:02:05.960> I

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and I go up 4 for y so this point here I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.740 
and I go up 4 for y so this point here I
could<00:02:06.289> represent<00:02:06.499> as<00:02:07.009> through<00:02:07.880> X<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.420> 3<00:02:09.009> y<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.039> 4

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
could represent as through X is 3 y is 4

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.300 
could represent as through X is 3 y is 4
and<00:02:11.750> always<00:02:12.080> when<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.500> whenever<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.040> write

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and always when you whenever you write

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.580 
and always when you whenever you write
whenever<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.360> write<00:02:14.600> an<00:02:14.750> ordered<00:02:15.080> pair<00:02:15.140> you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
whenever you write an ordered pair you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.040 
whenever you write an ordered pair you
always<00:02:15.920> put<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.160> X<00:02:16.520> input<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.570> always<00:02:17.840> put

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
always put the X input you always put

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.980 
always put the X input you always put
the<00:02:18.140> x<00:02:18.319> value<00:02:18.800> first<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.480> think<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.900> know

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
the x value first so I think you know

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.120 
the x value first so I think you know
what<00:02:21.110> I'm<00:02:21.200> gonna<00:02:21.290> help<00:02:21.500> me<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.920> help

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
what I'm gonna help me do to help

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.100 
what I'm gonna help me do to help
organize<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:22.940> ordered<00:02:23.330> pairs<00:02:23.600> I'm<00:02:23.870> gonna

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
organize my ordered pairs I'm gonna

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.730 
organize my ordered pairs I'm gonna
create<00:02:24.380> an<00:02:24.530> input/output<00:02:25.250> chart<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.930> here's

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
create an input/output chart so here's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.230 
create an input/output chart so here's
my<00:02:27.890> input/output<00:02:28.580> chart<00:02:28.880> when<00:02:29.780> X<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.230> 3<00:02:30.680> y<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.460> 4

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
my input/output chart when X is 3 y is 4

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.510 
my input/output chart when X is 3 y is 4
that's<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.990> my<00:02:33.140> ordered<00:02:33.590> pairs<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.190> guess

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
that's one of my ordered pairs and guess

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.589 
that's one of my ordered pairs and guess
what

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
what

pause me not you unpause me this point

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.489 
pause me not you unpause me this point
here<00:03:03.049> looks<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.379> X<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:04.010> 5<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.760> Y<00:03:04.849> is<00:03:05.719> 6<00:03:06.260> I

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:06.499 
here looks like X is 5 and Y is 6 I

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:11.860 
here looks like X is 5 and Y is 6 I
would<00:03:06.680> do<00:03:06.829> 5<00:03:07.189> 6<00:03:07.879> I<00:03:08.180> go<00:03:08.750> over<00:03:09.200> 5<00:03:09.469> up<00:03:09.799> 6<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:11.389> this

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
would do 5 6 I go over 5 up 6 and this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.770 
would do 5 6 I go over 5 up 6 and this
one<00:03:12.079> here<00:03:12.469> looks<00:03:12.500> like<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.980> go<00:03:13.129> over<00:03:13.549> 7<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.239> up

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
one here looks like I go over 7 and up

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.589 
one here looks like I go over 7 and up
10<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.730> one<00:03:16.939> here<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.269> go<00:03:17.540> over<00:03:18.019> 10<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.650> up

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
10 and this one here I go over 10 and up

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.339 
10 and this one here I go over 10 and up
14<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:20.959> 10<00:03:21.489> 14<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.000> one<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.389> go<00:03:23.599> over<00:03:23.989> 12

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
14 so 10 14 and this one I go over 12

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.289 
14 so 10 14 and this one I go over 12
and<00:03:24.819> up<00:03:25.819> what<00:03:26.469> 15<00:03:27.469> and<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:28.669> could<00:03:28.879> write<00:03:29.090> all

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
and up what 15 and I could write all

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.360 
and up what 15 and I could write all
these<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.780> could<00:03:30.019> write<00:03:30.439> all<00:03:30.709> these<00:03:30.949> on<00:03:31.219> my

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
these I could write all these on my

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.479 
these I could write all these on my
input/output<00:03:32.209> chart<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.620> definitely<00:03:34.099> have

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
input/output chart so I definitely have

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.920 
input/output chart so I definitely have
5<00:03:34.790> 6<00:03:35.180> when<00:03:35.419> when<00:03:35.840> X<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.230> 5<00:03:36.469> y<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.889> 6<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.829> have

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
5 6 when when X is 5 y is 6 and I have

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.349 
5 6 when when X is 5 y is 6 and I have
so<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.989> got<00:03:42.199> this<00:03:42.349> one<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.009> I<00:03:43.099> got<00:03:43.280> 14<00:03:43.970> 10

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
so I got this one here and I got 14 10

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.909 
so I got this one here and I got 14 10
no<00:03:44.720> no<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:44.959> didn't<00:03:45.169> get<00:03:45.259> 14<00:03:45.739> 10<00:03:45.979> I<00:03:46.269> have<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.540> have<00:03:47.930> 7

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
no no I didn't get 14 10 I have I have 7

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.369 
no no I didn't get 14 10 I have I have 7
11<00:03:49.340> right<00:03:49.759> oh<00:03:49.970> did<00:03:50.449> I<00:03:50.509> make<00:03:50.689> a<00:03:50.720> mistake<00:03:50.780> here

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
11 right oh did I make a mistake here

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.619 
11 right oh did I make a mistake here
yeah<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.069> guess<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.579> did<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.790> guess<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.359> more

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
yeah I guess I did I guess this is more

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.710 
yeah I guess I did I guess this is more
than<00:03:53.810> 10<00:03:54.280> cuz<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.579> little<00:03:55.819> higher<00:03:56.060> than<00:03:56.090> 10

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
than 10 cuz it's a little higher than 10

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.509 
than 10 cuz it's a little higher than 10
so<00:03:57.489> see<00:03:58.489> I'm<00:03:59.329> glad<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.889> I'm<00:04:00.889> glad<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.340> you

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
so see I'm glad that I I'm glad that you

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.249 
so see I'm glad that I I'm glad that you
know<00:04:01.549> I've<00:04:01.939> caught<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:02.629> because<00:04:02.870> it's<00:04:03.019> easy

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:03.259 
know I've caught that because it's easy

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.879 
know I've caught that because it's easy
to<00:04:03.409> make<00:04:03.620> mistakes<00:04:03.769> like<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:05.019> all<00:04:06.019> right

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
to make mistakes like that all right

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.509 
to make mistakes like that all right
so<00:04:07.790> all<00:04:08.150> these<00:04:08.449> ones<00:04:08.810> are<00:04:09.139> ordered<00:04:09.739> pairs<00:04:10.069> they

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
so all these ones are ordered pairs they

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.520 
so all these ones are ordered pairs they
work<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.329> when<00:04:11.479> you<00:04:11.509> write<00:04:11.810> ordered<00:04:12.229> pairs

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
work and when you write ordered pairs

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.530 
work and when you write ordered pairs
you<00:04:12.650> always<00:04:13.069> write<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.400> x<00:04:13.579> coordinate<00:04:14.239> first

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
you always write the x coordinate first

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.819 
you always write the x coordinate first
then<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.959> Y<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:16.190> last<00:04:16.609> one<00:04:17.000> fort<00:04:17.829> 1410

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
then the Y this last one fort 1410

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.209 
then the Y this last one fort 1410
that's<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.849> this<00:04:20.120> when<00:04:20.539> X<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.959> 14<00:04:21.530> what<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:22.009> y

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
that's like this when X is 14 what is y

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.899 
that's like this when X is 14 what is y
and<00:04:23.000> we<00:04:23.120> don't<00:04:23.300> have<00:04:23.479> that<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.960> our<00:04:23.990> grid<00:04:24.909> so

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
and we don't have that on our grid so

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.760 
and we don't have that on our grid so
that's<00:04:26.180> actually<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.630> one<00:04:26.780> that's<00:04:26.840> not<00:04:27.289> here

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that's actually the one that's not here

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.180 
that's actually the one that's not here
and<00:04:27.949> it<00:04:28.099> looks<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.430> they<00:04:28.789> they<00:04:29.180> flipped<00:04:30.190> they

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
and it looks like they they flipped they

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.510 
and it looks like they they flipped they
they<00:04:31.880> flipped<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.599> point<00:04:33.020> here<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:34.219> very

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
they flipped this point here so very

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.189 
they flipped this point here so very
easy<00:04:34.759> to<00:04:35.000> make<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> mistake<00:04:35.300> if<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:35.900> were

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
easy to make a mistake if you were
