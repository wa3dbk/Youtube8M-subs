to go over this little box today this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.529 
to go over this little box today this
would<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.490> something<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
would be something that we do in the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.650 
would be something that we do in the
class<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> figured<00:00:29.400> maple<00:00:29.640> case<00:00:30.210> with

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
class we have a figured maple case with

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.870 
class we have a figured maple case with
walnut<00:00:31.940> splines<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> mahogany<00:00:34.050> top<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
walnut splines with a mahogany top and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.979 
walnut splines with a mahogany top and
what<00:00:35.880> we'll<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.690> through<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
what we'll do is just go through a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.139 
what we'll do is just go through a
little<00:00:37.200> process<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.890> how<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.910> there

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
little process of how we go to get there

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.990 
little process of how we go to get there
what<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> did<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.559> took<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:41.010> figured<00:00:41.790> maple

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
what I did was I took up figured maple

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
what I did was I took up figured maple
board<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.110> numbered<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> measured<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
board and I numbered it and measured it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
board and I numbered it and measured it
so<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> grain<00:00:46.530> pattern<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.250> line<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
so that the grain pattern is in line and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.479 
so that the grain pattern is in line and
then<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.750> took<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.590> grooved<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
then I took it and grooved it for the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
then I took it and grooved it for the
top<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> bottom<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.510> mitered<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
top and the bottom and mitered it for

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
top and the bottom and mitered it for
the<00:00:52.559> edges<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.850> we'll<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.539> we'll<00:00:55.140> get

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the edges so what we'll do is we'll get

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.240 
the edges so what we'll do is we'll get
ready<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.770> glue<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> piece<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> tape

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
ready to glue it up take a piece of tape

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.639 
ready to glue it up take a piece of tape
and<00:00:59.390> put<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.480> together<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.109> we're<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and put it together and we're going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.009 
and put it together and we're going to
move<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.070> fast<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.809> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
move kind of fast with this but this is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.609 
move kind of fast with this but this is
basically<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:05.159> process<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.170> what<00:01:07.170> we'll<00:01:07.409> do

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
basically the process and what we'll do

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.600 
basically the process and what we'll do
to<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.729> our<00:01:08.880> box<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:10.010> we<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.100> put<00:01:11.310> glue<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to make our box is we will put glue on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.140 
to make our box is we will put glue on
these<00:01:12.000> things<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.689> course<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.080> number<00:01:13.350> them

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
these things and of course I number them

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.670 
these things and of course I number them
and<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.750> how<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.020> clamp<00:01:16.470> them

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and this will be how we clamp them

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
and this will be how we clamp them
together<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:20.070> tape<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.970> blew<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
together that tape you blew it and the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
together that tape you blew it and the
tape<00:01:21.780> holds<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.170> together<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:23.759> fix

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
tape holds it together and we will fix

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.039 
tape holds it together and we will fix
this<00:01:24.509> bottom<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:26.280> sets<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
this bottom for it it sets in there and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
this bottom for it it sets in there and
all<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.530> glued<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.490> when<00:01:29.670> we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
all this will be glued and then when we

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
all this will be glued and then when we
made<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> top<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.659> made<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> special<00:01:31.770> jig<00:01:31.979> that's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
made the top I made a special jig that's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.429 
made the top I made a special jig that's
kind<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.610> small<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.299> holding<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> saw

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
kind of small to be holding on the saw

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.429 
kind of small to be holding on the saw
like<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.159> said<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.030> angle<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.960> 16

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
like that I said that angle up to 16

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.890 
like that I said that angle up to 16
degrees<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> table<00:01:38.520> saw<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.689> would

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
degrees on the table saw and I would

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.649 
degrees on the table saw and I would
just<00:01:40.079> run<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> across<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.159> flip<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.939> each<00:01:42.329> time

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
just run it across and flip it each time

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.910 
just run it across and flip it each time
that<00:01:43.229> way<00:01:43.560> everything<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.880> safe<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.170> now

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that way everything is safe for that now

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.670 
that way everything is safe for that now
for<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> splines<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.060> could<00:01:48.810> figured<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
for the splines I could figured out the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
for the splines I could figured out the
width<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.040> my<00:01:50.100> blade<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.670> stalker<00:01:51.240> fan<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
width of my blade on the stalker fan I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.219 
width of my blade on the stalker fan I
made<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:52.340> walnut<00:01:53.340> strips<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.869> cut<00:01:55.140> them

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
made little walnut strips and I cut them

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.160 
made little walnut strips and I cut them
to<00:01:55.409> length<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.270> course<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.780> sand

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to length and of course you have to sand

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
to length and of course you have to sand
this<00:01:58.380> every<00:01:58.890> move<00:01:59.070> before<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.939> because

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this every move before you go because

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.870 
this every move before you go because
it's<00:02:00.420> kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> hard<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> sand<00:02:01.200> inside<00:02:01.530> box

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's kind of hard to sand inside box

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
it's kind of hard to sand inside box
then<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.210> my<00:02:03.329> splines<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.960> set<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.409> little

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
then for my splines I set this little

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.520 
then for my splines I set this little
jig<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> fits<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> groove

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
jig up here where it fits in the groove

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.219 
jig up here where it fits in the groove
and<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.940> saw<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> little

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and the saw that I use is a little

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.390 
and the saw that I use is a little
different<00:02:10.500> than<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.160> doesn't

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
different than this one so it doesn't

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790 
different than this one so it doesn't
fit<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> blade<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.510> basically<00:02:12.780> set<00:02:13.590> my

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
fit the blade that I basically set my

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.030 
fit the blade that I basically set my
box<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.180> stop<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.650> set<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
box here with this stop and I set the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680 
box here with this stop and I set the
height<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> song<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.819> run<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.120> across<00:02:18.209> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
height to the song we run it across and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.100 
height to the song we run it across and
it<00:02:18.990> cuts<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> grooves<00:02:19.760> once<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.150> we

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
it cuts the grooves once we do that we

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.809 
it cuts the grooves once we do that we
take<00:02:22.380> these<00:02:22.560> little<00:02:22.890> splines<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.550> glue<00:02:23.700> them

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
take these little splines and glue them

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.870 
take these little splines and glue them
and<00:02:24.030> hammer<00:02:24.239> them<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.400> then<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.550> sand

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and hammer them in here and then we sand

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.660 
and hammer them in here and then we sand
our<00:02:27.060> box<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.690> put<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> together<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.100> now<00:02:29.459> all

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
our box and put it together and now all

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.820 
our box and put it together and now all
I<00:02:29.700> need<00:02:29.850> for<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.270> box<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.110> handle

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
I need for my box of the little handle

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.070 
I need for my box of the little handle
for<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.100> top<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.060> come<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.390> take<00:02:33.569> our<00:02:33.720> class

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
for the top so come to take our class

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.199 
for the top so come to take our class
and<00:02:34.410> you'll<00:02:35.010> begin<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> make<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:35.819> like<00:02:35.970> this

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
and you'll begin to make one like this

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.080 
and you'll begin to make one like this
or<00:02:36.450> something<00:02:36.959> like
