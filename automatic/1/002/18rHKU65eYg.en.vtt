00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
mean and then we do this one so you can

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.660 
mean and then we do this one so you can
see<00:00:35.989> that<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> iPhone<00:00:39.480> 4<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.370> may<00:00:41.520> not

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
see that is the iPhone 4 so this may not

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
see that is the iPhone 4 so this may not
be<00:00:41.730> perfect<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> hard<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
be perfect because it's kind of hard to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.930 
be perfect because it's kind of hard to
do<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.010> perfect

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
do this perfect

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.119 
do this perfect
I<00:00:44.969> mean<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> always<00:00:45.899> miss<00:00:46.110> something<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
I mean you always miss something but you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.119 
I mean you always miss something but you
can<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.520> kinda<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> view<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:49.260> speed<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
can get kinda like a view on speed so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.900 
can get kinda like a view on speed so
