00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
tricks of what I'm doing so this is my

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.670 
tricks of what I'm doing so this is my
helper<00:00:23.720> Dan<00:00:24.750> he's<00:00:25.260> 6<00:00:25.619> 6<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.130> 20<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.789> 5<00:00:27.570> 9<00:00:27.900> 200

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
lose now that is to say if we both come

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.370 
lose now that is to say if we both come
down<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> stalemate<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> middle

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.850 
down and it's a stalemate in the middle
then<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.890> restart<00:01:27.409> another<00:01:28.409> thing<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then we just restart another thing that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
then we just restart another thing that
can<00:01:28.950> happen<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.360> happens<00:01:30.689> pretty

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
can happen that's very it happens pretty

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
can happen that's very it happens pretty
often<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> slip<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.180> go<00:01:33.329> addict<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
often is a slip so if we go addict and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.950 
often is a slip so if we go addict and
we<00:01:34.320> both<00:01:34.470> try<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> top<00:01:35.189> roll<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.540> slip<00:01:36.810> out

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
we both try to top roll we can slip out

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.429 
we both try to top roll we can slip out
and<00:01:37.909> what<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> happen<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.229> line

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and what has to happen then is we line

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.160 
and what has to happen then is we line
up<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.460> referees<00:01:41.850> position<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.570> they'll

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
up like a referees position and they'll

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
up like a referees position and they'll
put<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> vote<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> velcro<00:01:44.549> strap<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
put a vote are not a velcro strap with a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.210 
put a vote are not a velcro strap with a
strap<00:01:45.450> around<00:01:45.930> both<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> our<00:01:46.710> hands<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.189> we

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
strap around both of our hands so we

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.670 
strap around both of our hands so we
can't<00:01:47.549> separate<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.360> until<00:01:49.290> after<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
can't separate it all until after the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
can't separate it all until after the
match<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.070> over<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:51.240> prevents<00:01:51.630> any<00:01:51.750> slipping

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
match is over that prevents any slipping

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.539 
match is over that prevents any slipping
and<00:01:52.470> there's<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> winner

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and there's going to be a winner

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.179 
and there's going to be a winner
afterward<00:01:54.119> straps<00:01:54.990> favor<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.680> brute<00:01:55.950> strength

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
afterward straps favor or brute strength

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.090 
afterward straps favor or brute strength

stalemate<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.650> it's<00:03:55.040> really<00:03:55.250> technical<00:03:55.880> its

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
stalemate so it's really technical its
