00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:08.889
 I'm not in Ceará. 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:11.019
 I'm not in the northeast I'm not in 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.999
 big mistake of the south 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.270
 nor in rio de janeiro in the holy spirit 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:19.600
 No mines, I'm in Sao Paulo. 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.250
 in são paulo where the media continues 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.260
 saying that water is missing and I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.270
 I ask what is this? 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.640
 If I'm in São Paulo and have this 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.879
 world of water you see here 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.800
 I ask the media she works on 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.219
 function of the people 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.059
 how can one suppose to imagine that 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.129
 any kind of body work for 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.409
 the other for free 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.890
 I ask you what is more 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.769
 Someone smart works for you. 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.809
 Grace, would you hire any one? 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.530
 any company whatsoever. 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:04.210
 organization to work for you 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.300
 Grace you could get somebody but you. 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.430
 believe the media does this to you 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.060
 believe that television works its 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.770
 favor of grace 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.280
 this is normal 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.170
 or you should rethink about these 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.390
 concepts or rethinking about it is 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
 normal to speak in a sock because of the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 wind if the wind does not hit here do not know 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.030
 the sound of one knows a horrible noise 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.700
 So I got the 6 that I could not 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.910
 mess up i speak into the microphone 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.790
 this is normal is not normal is believing 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.670
 that the media works in our favor 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.670
 and we did not give a penny to 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.150
 set up the TV station and not to 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.520
 the maintenance of the tv station komo 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.640
 so tv is going to work for us 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 we do not have a penny for 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.670
 build radio set up radio and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.950
 also to keep the radio as we go 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.930
 imagine that the radio works for us the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.860
 who works for us is daddy from heaven and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.080
 sending the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 I got here in this dam and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 I told you that she was being 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 exhausted because it was too low 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 In a time that was not for 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 remember this 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 and now as it has rained very much 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.490
 very much 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.850
 This dam is too crowded. 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.360
 It's too daunting for you to have an idea 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.040
 Last Thursday I was here today is 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.470
 Wednesday 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.900
 then seven days have passed since 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.630
 I've been here and I know exactly here 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.220
 mark that is the straight line of a tree that 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.070
 There it is, this is where I'll call. 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.880
 I gave you this far to see something. 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:04.360
 O look here can turn that amadinha 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.110
 stone that is there, you see this stone 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.760
 and yesterday this stone was outside and it is 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.150
 to know that there is room for 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.820
 the margin is it to know that dinha 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.209
 The margin was beyond that stone in the 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.330
 Sunday jec fourth and fifth when 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.430
 I was here yesterday I have a little plant there 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.420
 the other threw the stone on it to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.190
 see if you can see 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.900
 what country is that last when 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.410
 When I was here on Thursday 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.870
 Past today is Wednesday to seven days ago. 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.209
 this margin that is here was almost 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 that both here and beyond 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.100
 That little plant that was coming 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.000
 This year I marked that little plant. 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.410
 including that it is on the line of a 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.450
 tree for me do not lose sight of it 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.700
 today the plant is totally 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.680
 submerged looks at you, you see that he 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.519
 is underwater is a little plant of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.150
 about 40 50 centimeters does not reach 80 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.670
 centimeters but it was somewhat of that 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.190
 here you are looking here for water 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.080
 was beside her on a 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.790
 week about it all but not that it does not 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.400
 it is in this dam that in the name of a 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.320
 company overview Maria spoke look 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.840
 only I know it's just an arm of the dam 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.880
 put on sale on one arm of her 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.990
 this is an arm of the dam dam 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.410
 huge huge huge huge is a 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.210
 dam that has lots of lots of water 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.569
 I think that amount of water 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.759
 on here 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:34.020
 Can you give Sao Paulo a full supply? 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:38.020
 for at least one year without 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.270
 refuel here or keep the rain 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.039
 It has filled only what has water here. 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.360
 because it's a lot of water that's just an arm of the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.129
 dam here follows an arm of the dam 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.289
 now this dam has many arms 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.990
 this is a crazy no- name thing and 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.449
 we are in são paulo here is são paulo 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.319
 So how to say that water is lacking in 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.539
 Paulo 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.249
 If you have water, and Sao Paulo. 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.959
 Why are not Paul in the river? 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.809
 big southern no I'm not in the 

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:06.039
 paraiba I'm not in the northeast of the study 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.889
 do not agress 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.279
 I'm not in Manaus where there are many 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:16.180
 I'm not in the marsh I'm in 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:19.089
 São Paulo here in São Paulo is capital 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.729
 which is the metropolitan area that is the 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:24.309
 center of são paulo in the interior of são 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.129
 here is the area of ​​great são paulo 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:30.099
 where the media says it's missing 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:33.069
 water to sell water for coca 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:36.879
 cola nestlé to take water from the domain 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.139
 public as you already know but what 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.029
 I'm telling you that it's the 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.580
 following the situation of television is 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.949
 getting ridiculous rains 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.259
 Look, it's raining a little more here. 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.259
 It is raining more direct so much that the 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.240
 have been rising and they continue to 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.399
 the pumps exhausting water from the cantante 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.229
 to play to the other dams where 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:58.269
 they have to throw away 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.229
 the cantante is composed of several 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:01.240
 dams 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.369
 So where did they make a set of 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.300
 filming be sure not to set 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:06.339
 filming 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.119
 they go there collecting water from the volume 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:12.399
 dead to show on television but it's just 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.930
 film an arm of the dam sound arms in 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.759
 where they dried up 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.199
 in the end a company dam in the shade 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.389
 steel and now it has to run out of water 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:26.889
 there in the boxes in the lower dams 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.839
 the lower because otherwise will 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.579
 overflow to cities as 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.430
 Francisco Morato If I'm not mistaken in 

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:36.699
 place lab francisco da rocha 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.039
 then from the rock as free from 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.950
 mairiporan rock né 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.600
 if they do not drain the water will flood 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.340
 the cities then he has to play the 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.560
 water down the drain as you've seen others 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.020
 videos of other people talking to 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.330
 keep up there with that farce is 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.030
 a farce that the creator of heaven and 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:07:00.280
 every day makes it harder for them to 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:03.940
 keep yet basm the cattle 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.120
 livestock still believes that there is a lack of 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.120
 water in sao paulo 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.120
 unfortunate
