00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so 13 grams of protein to 18 grams of

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
so 13 grams of protein to 18 grams of
carbs<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.360> ratio<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.140> I

then<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> next<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.979> picked<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
then the next one I just picked up and I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.800 
then the next one I just picked up and I
was<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.150> through<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> labels

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
trying to find out the best ratio and I
actually<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.930> beat<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
actually think I just beat that one so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.940 
actually think I just beat that one so
this<00:01:17.280> next<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.299> cranberry

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
this next one is going to be cranberry

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.190 
this next one is going to be cranberry
beans<00:01:19.950> okay<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.479> still<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> lagoon

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
beans okay it's still in the lagoon

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
beans okay it's still in the lagoon
column<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.189> um<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> great<00:01:23.909> source<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> protein

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
column but um so great source of protein

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.380 
column but um so great source of protein
as<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.259> fiber<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> label<00:01:27.299> on

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
as well as fiber and this the label on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.870 
as well as fiber and this the label on
this<00:01:27.540> one

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.540 

so<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:34.050> has<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> total<00:01:34.980> carbohydrates

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
so this one has the total carbohydrates

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.340 
so this one has the total carbohydrates
of<00:01:35.670> 25<00:01:36.030> grams<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.630> 10<00:01:36.840> grams<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.230> dietary

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of 25 grams with 10 grams of dietary

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.070 
of 25 grams with 10 grams of dietary
fiber<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.580> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.760> take<00:01:38.940> away<00:01:38.970> 15<00:01:39.690> grams<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
fiber so if you take away 15 grams of

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.770 
fiber so if you take away 15 grams of
net<00:01:40.260> carbs<00:01:40.620> after<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.980> fact<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.550> as<00:01:42.330> 10

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
net carbs after a fact as well as 10

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.110 
net carbs after a fact as well as 10
grams<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> protein<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.710> no<00:01:43.860> sugars<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.880> this

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
grams of protein and no sugars so this

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.610 
grams of protein and no sugars so this
point<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.510> dominates<00:01:46.170> those<00:01:46.350> green

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
point actually dominates those green

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.030 
point actually dominates those green
split<00:01:46.890> split<00:01:47.640> peas<00:01:47.970> /<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.230> know<00:01:49.350> per<00:01:49.560> serving

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
split split peas / you know per serving

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.530 
split split peas / you know per serving
so<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.400> really<00:01:50.580> are<00:01:50.790> getting<00:01:50.850> 10<00:01:51.180> grams<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
so we really are getting 10 grams of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.080 
so we really are getting 10 grams of
protein<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.110> 15<00:01:52.830> grams<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.190> carbs<00:01:53.490> which<00:01:53.730> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
protein and 15 grams of carbs which is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.210 
protein and 15 grams of carbs which is
great<00:01:54.530> something<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> guys<00:01:55.800> should<00:01:55.860> look

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
great something you guys should look
