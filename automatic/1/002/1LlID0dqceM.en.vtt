00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:13.541
 Hello, people! 

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.355
 Look, shit, and she shot us two hundred ... 

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:30.158
 Who would have expected? But eggs ... 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.874
 But when I was president, it was Crackòvia! 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.414
 I will not even mention Barca. 

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.554
 Now you will probably remind me about Bernabé ... 

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:52.642
 3: 4 on Bernabéu, pfi. What does it mean compared to my 6: 2! 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.225
 Sorry, but there is nothing to be modest. 

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.415
 What's up? 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.186
 You, blah, blah, blah, you had to do the same thing as I was Real coach. 

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:12.512
 So what? Will you put my finger in the eye now? 

00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:17.394
 You may be brave at the distance, but you will not come here. 

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.218
 Get lost, hence, for two! 

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:24.829
 Clown. 

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:26.937
 What did I tell you about ... And yes! 

00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:32.395
 So it used to be a lot better, and this party does not make up for a decent bb! 

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.903
 Where's music? Where is the open bar? 

00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:38.308
 Who organized everything at all? 

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:40.930
 Who is responsible for this fare? Sandruszko? 

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.600
 I think there is a party on the level. 

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:49.030
 You have to decorate the bums like in the good old days. I'm right? 

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:52.460
 Come on, pay my awesome! 

00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:09.100
 This is called a good party, hen! 

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:16.340
 What about my balloons that I pumped half the evening? 

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.690
 Put them in your ass. 

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:28.250
 Listen, if you make so much noise, I'll call the police. 

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:31.070
 And call yourself if you think it will help you. 

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:42.040
 This is not true, my events certainly did not look like that. 

00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:42.930
 No? 

00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:48.060
 No, there were more champagne and girls at my parties. 

00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:51.410
 Let them learn! 

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:53.717
 I'll show them how it's done. 

00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:55.450
 I'm Valenti, this runner ... 

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:59.080
 This one has style.
