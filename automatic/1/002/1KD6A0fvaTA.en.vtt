compound that's pretty darn good
thermal<00:01:11.270> compound<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.520> real<00:01:13.789> quick<00:01:14.060> let

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
thermal compound and just real quick let

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:20.889 
thermal compound and just real quick let
me<00:01:14.450> look<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.810> see<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.380> as<00:01:18.530> am3+<00:01:19.250> FM<00:01:20.090> 1<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.420> FM<00:01:20.689> 2

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
me look and see so as am3+ FM 1 and FM 2

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.830 
me look and see so as am3+ FM 1 and FM 2
those<00:01:21.500> right<00:01:21.710> there<00:01:22.329> so<00:01:23.329> let's<00:01:23.359> go<00:01:23.570> ahead<00:01:23.630> and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
those right there so let's go ahead and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.520 
those right there so let's go ahead and
pop<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:24.259> baby<00:01:24.469> open<00:01:26.469> first<00:01:27.469> we<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:27.950> a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
pop this baby open first we have a

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.789 
pop this baby open first we have a
little<00:01:30.530> note<00:01:31.280> from<00:01:35.859> noctua<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:39.590> looks

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
little note from noctua and it looks

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.499 
little note from noctua and it looks
like<00:01:42.159> hopefully<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.850> isn't<00:01:44.179> one<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.450> you

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
like hopefully this isn't one that you

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.359 
like hopefully this isn't one that you
have<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:44.840> remove<00:01:45.109> the<00:01:45.320> backplate<00:01:45.499> on<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:48.369> think

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
have to remove the backplate on I think

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.550 
have to remove the backplate on I think
it<00:01:49.520> might<00:01:49.729> actually<00:01:49.939> be<00:01:50.270> however<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.499> I'll

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
it might actually be however so I'll

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.380 
it might actually be however so I'll
have<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.740> look<00:01:51.859> into<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.130> um<00:01:52.520> means<00:01:53.149> I'd<00:01:53.270> have

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
have to look into that um means I'd have

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.940 
have to look into that um means I'd have
to<00:01:53.479> take<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.749> motherboard<00:01:54.170> out<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.409> my<00:01:54.530> media

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
to take the motherboard out of my media

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.029 
to take the motherboard out of my media
center<00:01:55.189> PC<00:01:55.219> I<00:01:55.579> was<00:01:55.759> hoping<00:01:55.969> this<00:01:56.090> was<00:01:56.299> just<00:01:56.509> a

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
center PC I was hoping this was just a

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.620 
center PC I was hoping this was just a
snap-on<00:01:58.039> that'd<00:01:58.310> be<00:01:58.399> easy<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:58.759> replace<00:01:59.090> but<00:01:59.389> I

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
snap-on that'd be easy to replace but I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.230 
snap-on that'd be easy to replace but I
guess<00:02:00.139> we'll<00:02:00.289> find<00:02:00.499> that<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:01.729> also<00:02:01.880> comes

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
guess we'll find that out it also comes

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.370 
guess we'll find that out it also comes
with<00:02:02.359> a<00:02:02.929> pretty<00:02:03.799> heavy<00:02:04.039> duty<00:02:04.960> metal<00:02:05.960> case

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
with a pretty heavy duty metal case

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020 
with a pretty heavy duty metal case
badge<00:02:06.619> if<00:02:06.950> you're<00:02:07.130> into<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.429> kind<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.819> thing

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
badge if you're into that kind of thing

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.440 
badge if you're into that kind of thing
that's<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.470> solid<00:02:09.950> case<00:02:10.130> badge<00:02:10.399> right<00:02:10.610> stick

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that's as a solid case badge right stick

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.420 
that's as a solid case badge right stick
these<00:02:13.450> are<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.200> aforementioned

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
these are the aforementioned

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.580 
these are the aforementioned
screws<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:17.440> actually<00:02:17.830> comes<00:02:18.129> with<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.349> this<00:02:20.500> is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
screws it actually comes with so this is

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.860 
screws it actually comes with so this is
actually<00:02:20.830> really<00:02:20.950> well<00:02:21.159> packaged<00:02:21.790> up<00:02:21.970> I'll

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
actually really well packaged up I'll

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.149 
actually really well packaged up I'll
give<00:02:23.140> them<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.290> much<00:02:23.620> right<00:02:23.830> now<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.769> this<00:02:26.950> is

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
give them that much right now so this is

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:33.420 
give them that much right now so this is
a<00:02:27.190> low<00:02:27.580> noise<00:02:29.549> adapter<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.769> reduces<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
a low noise adapter so this reduces it

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.140 
a low noise adapter so this reduces it
down<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:34.090> its<00:02:34.900> either<00:02:35.079> 5<00:02:35.379> or<00:02:35.409> 7<00:02:35.799> volts<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
down to its either 5 or 7 volts and it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.089 
down to its either 5 or 7 volts and it
comes<00:02:40.390> with<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:43.540> thermal<00:02:44.049> compound<00:02:44.260> I'm<00:02:44.769> not

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
comes with the thermal compound I'm not

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.240 
comes with the thermal compound I'm not
sure<00:02:45.519> let's<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.269> don't<00:02:47.260> think<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.099> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
sure let's see I don't think this is a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.729 
sure let's see I don't think this is a
full<00:02:48.849> bottle<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.870> think<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.349> goes<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
full bottle I think it just goes to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.390 
full bottle I think it just goes to
about<00:02:50.859> about<00:02:51.819> here<00:02:52.980> let<00:02:53.980> me<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.220> actually

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
about about here let me see I actually

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.440 
about about here let me see I actually
have<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:56.040> normal<00:02:57.040> sized<00:02:57.519> bottle<00:02:57.970> around<00:02:58.060> here

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
have a normal sized bottle around here

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.420 
have a normal sized bottle around here
summer<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:03.040> there's<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.359> normal<00:03:04.750> sized<00:03:05.430> 3

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
summer so there's the the normal sized 3

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.809 
summer so there's the the normal sized 3
ounce<00:03:06.579> or<00:03:07.090> two<00:03:07.299> ounce<00:03:07.750> not<00:03:08.739> much<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.430> three

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
ounce or two ounce not much was three

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.330 
ounce or two ounce not much was three
grand<00:03:10.060> maybe<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.069> know<00:03:13.829> it's<00:03:14.829> maybe<00:03:15.040> half

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
plate with in the obligatory finger test

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.839 
plate with in the obligatory finger test
not<00:03:54.730> super<00:03:55.239> shiny<00:03:55.510> but<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.609> it<00:03:57.699> does

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
not super shiny but it is so it does

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.479 
not super shiny but it is so it does
have<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> little<00:03:58.359> bit<00:03:58.599> of<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:59.280> concave<00:04:00.280> or<00:04:00.430> convex

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
have a little bit of a concave or convex

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.050 
have a little bit of a concave or convex
curve<00:04:01.419> on<00:04:01.629> it<00:04:01.660> which<00:04:02.379> means<00:04:02.620> when<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.669> sucks

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
curve on it which means when it sucks

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.670 
curve on it which means when it sucks
down<00:04:04.329> it'll<00:04:04.599> make<00:04:04.750> better<00:04:04.930> contact<00:04:05.379> with<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
down it'll make better contact with the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.449 
down it'll make better contact with the
middle<00:04:05.889> of<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.010> CPU<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:07.840> does<00:04:08.199> have<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:09.010> super

me this is going to be an add-on to the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.499 
me this is going to be an add-on to the
PC<00:04:48.749> and<00:04:49.460> it's<00:04:50.460> an<00:04:50.580> HTPC<00:04:52.669> looks<00:04:53.669> like<00:04:53.819> you<00:04:54.360> need

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
PC and it's an HTPC looks like you need

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.149 
PC and it's an HTPC looks like you need
to<00:04:54.539> use<00:04:54.659> their<00:04:55.020> backplate<00:04:55.499> and<00:04:55.830> their<00:04:56.789> screws

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
to use their backplate and their screws

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.809 
to use their backplate and their screws
and<00:04:59.159> unfortunately<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:01.050> my<00:05:01.319> scenario<00:05:01.860> I'm

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
and unfortunately in my scenario I'm

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.409 
and unfortunately in my scenario I'm
actually<00:05:03.060> gonna<00:05:03.300> have<00:05:03.509> to<00:05:03.689> take<00:05:03.870> out<00:05:04.099> the<00:05:05.419> the

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
actually gonna have to take out the the

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.459 
actually gonna have to take out the the
motherboard<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.930> be<00:05:06.990> able<00:05:07.139> to<00:05:07.199> do<00:05:07.319> this

motherboard to be able to do this

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:14.899 
motherboard to be able to do this
because<00:05:07.710> it's<00:05:08.279> an<00:05:08.370> HT<00:05:08.699> PC<00:05:09.090> case<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:12.319> I<00:05:13.789> did<00:05:14.789> it

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
because it's an HT PC case and I did it

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.850 
because it's an HT PC case and I did it

cases<00:05:37.110> like<00:05:38.659> the<00:05:39.659> no<00:05:40.219> 304<00:05:41.219> or<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:42.029> node<00:05:42.509> 605

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
cases like the no 304 or the node 605

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.529 
cases like the no 304 or the node 605
from<00:05:43.589> fractal<00:05:44.069> and<00:05:45.000> they<00:05:45.240> don't<00:05:45.419> have

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
from fractal and they don't have

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.420 
from fractal and they don't have
backplate<00:05:45.930> cutouts<00:05:46.289> because<00:05:46.680> there's<00:05:47.279> no

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
backplate cutouts because there's no

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.769 
backplate cutouts because there's no
place<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.639> put<00:05:47.789> a<00:05:47.939> backplate<00:05:48.330> cut<00:05:48.509> out<00:05:48.599> you're

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
place to put a backplate cut out you're

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.059 
place to put a backplate cut out you're
mounting<00:05:48.899> the<00:05:49.169> board<00:05:49.379> to<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.620> bottom<00:05:49.889> of<00:05:49.979> the

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
mounting the board to the bottom of the

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.119 
mounting the board to the bottom of the
case<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:50.759> it's<00:05:51.599> not<00:05:51.689> really<00:05:51.960> their<00:05:52.649> fault<00:05:52.680> that

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
case so it's not really their fault that

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.010 
case so it's not really their fault that
it<00:05:53.250> works<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.610> way<00:05:53.789> but<00:05:54.029> just<00:05:54.599> keep<00:05:54.750> that<00:05:54.870> in

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
it works that way but just keep that in

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.149 
it works that way but just keep that in
mind<00:05:55.229> that<00:05:55.349> you<00:05:55.469> probably<00:05:55.680> want<00:05:55.889> to<00:05:56.039> buy<00:05:56.099> this

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
mind that you probably want to buy this

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.809 
mind that you probably want to buy this
before<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:58.080> do<00:05:58.229> your<00:05:58.409> installation<00:05:59.039> don't

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
before you do your installation don't

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.719 
before you do your installation don't
think<00:06:00.149> of<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.389> as<00:06:00.599> an<00:06:00.810> easy<00:06:01.110> add-on<00:06:01.979> I<00:06:02.219> mean<00:06:02.639> if

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
think of it as an easy add-on I mean if

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.740 
think of it as an easy add-on I mean if
you<00:06:02.819> don't<00:06:03.000> care<00:06:03.180> about<00:06:03.300> pulling<00:06:03.689> your

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
you don't care about pulling your

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.589 
you don't care about pulling your
motherboard<00:06:04.080> out<00:06:04.319> it's<00:06:05.039> not<00:06:05.189> a<00:06:05.219> big<00:06:05.460> deal<00:06:05.639> but

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
motherboard out it's not a big deal but

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.079 
motherboard out it's not a big deal but
you<00:06:06.839> know<00:06:07.560> my<00:06:07.830> case<00:06:08.069> it's<00:06:08.399> it's<00:06:08.729> probably

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
you know my case it's it's probably

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:12.589 
you know my case it's it's probably
gonna<00:06:09.240> you<00:06:09.569> know<00:06:09.689> cause<00:06:10.969> 20<00:06:11.969> minutes<00:06:12.240> of<00:06:12.360> extra

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
gonna you know cause 20 minutes of extra

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.420 
gonna you know cause 20 minutes of extra
work<00:06:12.870> for<00:06:12.899> you<00:06:13.560> know<00:06:13.649> if<00:06:13.740> this<00:06:13.889> used<00:06:14.219> the

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
work for you know if this used the

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.559 
work for you know if this used the
standard<00:06:15.620> MD<00:06:16.879> mounting<00:06:17.879> solution<00:06:18.120> it<00:06:18.509> would

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
standard MD mounting solution it would

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.369 
standard MD mounting solution it would
just<00:06:18.750> be<00:06:18.870> a<00:06:18.899> snap-on<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:20.839> but<00:06:21.839> you<00:06:22.050> know<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.259> is

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
just be a snap-on so but you know it is

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:28.040 
just be a snap-on so but you know it is
what<00:06:22.529> it<00:06:22.560> is<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:23.569> I'll<00:06:24.569> check<00:06:26.810> you<00:06:27.810> know<00:06:27.839> it's

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
what it is and I'll check you know it's

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.600 
what it is and I'll check you know it's
because<00:06:28.259> it<00:06:28.409> mounts<00:06:28.710> through<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:29.069> bottom<00:06:29.399> if

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
because it mounts through the bottom if

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.550 
because it mounts through the bottom if
there<00:06:29.789> was<00:06:29.879> some<00:06:30.000> way<00:06:30.120> to<00:06:30.149> go<00:06:30.360> you<00:06:30.539> know<00:06:30.659> down

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
there was some way to go you know down

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.579 
there was some way to go you know down
in<00:06:31.770> through<00:06:31.949> the<00:06:32.069> top<00:06:32.279> or<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:33.060> know<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.330> hook

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:33.589 
in through the top or you know the hook

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:37.279 
in through the top or you know the hook
that<00:06:34.589> the<00:06:34.979> normal<00:06:35.370> solutions<00:06:36.209> have

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
that the normal solutions have

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.389 
that the normal solutions have
and<00:06:37.379> it<00:06:37.469> wouldn't<00:06:37.649> be<00:06:37.770> that<00:06:37.919> big<00:06:38.039> of<00:06:38.159> a<00:06:38.249> deal

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:38.399 
and it wouldn't be that big of a deal

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:41.269 
and it wouldn't be that big of a deal
but<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:40.080> is<00:06:40.229> one<00:06:40.409> of<00:06:40.439> the<00:06:40.559> better<00:06:40.680> performing

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:41.279 
but this is one of the better performing

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.129 
but this is one of the better performing
low-profile<00:06:41.939> fans<00:06:42.210> on<00:06:42.419> the<00:06:42.479> market<00:06:42.809> I<00:06:42.990> think

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
low-profile fans on the market I think

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.809 
low-profile fans on the market I think
it's<00:06:43.499> gonna<00:06:43.619> be<00:06:43.830> worth<00:06:44.039> the<00:06:44.219> time<00:06:44.369> and<00:06:44.430> effort

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 
it's gonna be worth the time and effort

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.820 
it's gonna be worth the time and effort
for<00:06:44.849> me<00:06:45.089> to<00:06:45.210> put<00:06:45.360> this<00:06:45.449> into<00:06:45.659> the<00:06:45.749> HTPC<00:06:46.559> so

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
for me to put this into the HTPC so

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.450 
for me to put this into the HTPC so
you'll<00:06:47.339> see<00:06:47.550> a<00:06:47.580> video<00:06:47.999> coming<00:06:48.360> soon<00:06:48.479> of<00:06:48.930> that
