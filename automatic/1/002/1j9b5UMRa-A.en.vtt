00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.610
 the heart rate sensor 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.280
 similar to what we have already seen 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.340
 last year month 5 the button of 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.720

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.090
 fingerprint reader and then there are the two 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.100
 classic backlit buttons a 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.659
 disappeared on the front
