00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.139
 We prefer to come to youtube friends 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.750
 nine dogs customer video this time around 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.049
 the video go back how do i bring 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.890
 in the dog when he runs backwards 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.250
 every month there will be a new video 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.490
 will happen on 24 december 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 Christmas to you all 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.250
 ie 4 january 24 424 da march and so on 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.369
 continue to the topic how do I bring 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.510
 if my dog is back at an advantage 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.410
 the dog in dock 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.870
 if not then I support him completely 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.070
 Just in the bar it works like that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.320
 my hands I was in front of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 nose out in the snow resp 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 lit something on the back of a bar 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.840
 high then goes back with the yummy 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 and holds back at the same time firmly so 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.809
 that the dog can not sit down 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.969
 because as we have seen in the seat video 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.739
 every dog ​​will sit down if you 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.129
 the little thing goes to the back what 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.899
 one finds by it so I just take 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.460
 a nice yummy imagine me 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.720
 my dog ​​give that yummy in front of the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 needle which looks forward 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 Berlin hold the hand behind the bar 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.450
 automatically filled in and then with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 Tasty and person to the rear and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 back I'll show you how delicious 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.370
 before the nose back in groin 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.860
 support and back 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.540
 so the whole should look like the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.770
 second level is you let the hand 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.980
 At the back of the bar, face you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.380
 fire normally and put it down like that 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.790
 that he no longer sits and says go 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.350
 back or back anyway what 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.700
 want to take her film of command and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.780
 just go to the dog on top of the dog 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.100
 to and then actually 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.950
 go back because he does that 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.960
 understood so what is the next one 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 step and stand and then it works 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.100
 back back 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.420
 that's what the whole thing should look like 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.580
 the very last stage of back is that 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.410
 the dog returns without one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.880
 that he could really have it 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.910
 to intertwine otherwise that is understood 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.050
 it's rather difficult to teach so first 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.030
 leaves behind support then makes with 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.570
 the courage to act backstage last stage 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.920
 Dog goes to a back 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.080
 initial_pos is back stand or 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.600
 you help and always come as mine 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.340
 or dar and is already there sees coming 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.260
 here you go back back back 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.260
 back back 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.860
 that's the last level i'm coming 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.300
 Hope you come get it though 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.190
 something should not work 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.980
 then best in the comments or 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180
 write to facebook 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.660

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.520
