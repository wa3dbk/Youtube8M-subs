00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello youtubers welcome to the channel that 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 help in which I'll show you how 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.760
 repair your push notifications 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.500
 blackberry and the model version 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.469
 that is system or collective that is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 we are simply going to give the solution to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 typical mistake that many people say 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.980
 that blackberry applications do not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.560
 they serve that do not give maintenance between 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.840
 others what happens that the application 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.090
 facebook does not have enough cycles 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.160
 privileges to notify test that you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.650
 a message or notification has fallen 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.480
 let's solve that then when 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.090
 if you do not get the notifications in 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.130
 real time or chat messages in 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.260
 real time first what you have to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.600
 to do is enter the options menu or 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.790
 configuration respectively version 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.129
 of blackberry that you have once entered 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.540
 here it is enough to write it to 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.790
 Applications 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.680
 apple is at least while 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.190
 application management I'm 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.210
 using a 7.1 blackberry system 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.590
 the 93 20 and we're going to enter 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.750
 management of situations and 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.640
 respectively we have to verify 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.470
 that all exist to show us 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.340
 all applications how to register 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.490
 facebook just write the efe and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 we have to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 press the menu key and give it here in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.470
 edit permissions as you can see me 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.300
 I have to allow to allow 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.910
 you are the only thing they have to do 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.160
 is to give in allow because I guess 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.990
 I study this in rejecting or at least 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.040
 in personalized so you put 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.560
 is not allow to emit and that would be ready 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 everything and we're going to save the changes that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.870
 we did restart your mobile enter your 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030
 facebook and is already solved this 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.450
 problem so fast and easy 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.520
 remember to like it if it served you and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.620
 now you 're not going to have the problem that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.010
 you will not be notified when 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.250
 you have a message that really something 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.540
 annoyed because it sounds and you know that you 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 there is a message but if it does not 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.390
 so that the app will serve us 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.320
 so so this has been all see you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.320
 in a next video 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.140
