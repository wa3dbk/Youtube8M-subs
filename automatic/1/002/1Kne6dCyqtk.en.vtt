00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello, we are faced with it Berlin 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 applestore the last hour we felt 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 test or apple watch models and tried 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.269
 figure out what it is 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 Apple's first smart watch and this is my opinion 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.320
 a design that I want to shout right away 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.179
 shut up and take my money of course 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.000
 subjectively, as for me, looks like an apple 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.490
 watch is no worse than moto 360 or 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.859
 asus zen watch other models and not near 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.680
 there are body shape color combination 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.599
 display without boundaries all wow if you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.000
 a fine brush of forty two millimeter 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.369
 the model will sit down fine me personally a little 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.960
 embarrassed the thickness of the shell under a certain 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.219
 you can see a little bit in the corner 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.320
 raised above the skin 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.300
 convex sensor panel is to blame for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.739
 the rest will suit any outfits important 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.090
 pick the right watch live 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 say that some kind of dawn and not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.649
 I wondered I could not all beautiful but myself 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.570
 I personally would buy a sporty space gray 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 well this is not some bright bag is equal 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 I will not say much after an hour 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.050
 At home, she just twists different firmware 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.449
 on-screen menus can not use the clock 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.730
 tinctures apple watch can already drive 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 but this is not a complete experience using 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.229
 sharing you impressions scattered cool 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.990
 and what the hell is clean variation 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.150
 ios or collected with large buttons but 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.130
 familiar logic is like companion 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.979
 iphone apple watch will be able to almost 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.350
 not everyone is already looking forward to the list 20 30 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.540
 items are my favorite juice for smart watches 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 but the system is not easy there is no such took and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.369
 use need poklatsat poprikyknut 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.900
 figure out learn for a geek like 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.729
 me it's not a problem the other way around 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 I want to rein in the new gadget 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 and here is how it will be with ordinary users 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 I am not a girl of Yiddish by us or 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 busy businessman with the other eight i 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.780
 I do not think that they will understand me 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.290
 it seems they will use just 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.119
 like a clock 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.040
 if before dating I was an apple 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.850
 watch suspicious it is now ready 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.159
