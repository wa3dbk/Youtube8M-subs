just<00:03:36.860> based<00:03:37.070> off<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.460> Jonah<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.990> might<00:03:39.200> be

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
just based off the Jonah it might be

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.550 
just based off the Jonah it might be
easier<00:03:39.800> than<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.130> thought<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.370> would<00:03:40.520> be<00:03:40.820> I

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
easier than I thought it would be I

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.030 
easier than I thought it would be I
would<00:03:42.560> say<00:03:42.650> my<00:03:42.770> biggest<00:03:42.800> competitors<00:03:43.690> Caitlyn
