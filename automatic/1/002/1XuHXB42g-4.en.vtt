batteries<00:01:51.610> on<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.850> back<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.179> this<00:01:53.300> amp<00:01:53.509> rack<00:01:53.660> i

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
batteries on the back of this amp rack i

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.100 
batteries on the back of this amp rack i
do<00:01:53.959> have<00:01:54.229> dual<00:01:54.649> fans<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:56.240> intake<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.050> an

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
do have dual fans and intake and an

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.930 
do have dual fans and intake and an
exhaust<00:01:57.500> fan<00:01:57.590> for<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.130> amplifier<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:58.789> it's

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
exhaust fan for the amplifier so it's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.020 
exhaust fan for the amplifier so it's
actually<00:01:59.300> flowing<00:01:59.630> air<00:01:59.959> through<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.380> amp<00:02:00.530> and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
actually flowing air through the amp and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.370 
actually flowing air through the amp and
also<00:02:02.030> neons<00:02:02.920> woohoo<00:02:04.660> for<00:02:05.660> all<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.929> guys<00:02:06.080> that
