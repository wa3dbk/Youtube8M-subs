recent meetings I met sterling one time
and<00:01:03.710> I<00:01:03.769> asked<00:01:03.980> him<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:04.220> what<00:01:04.370> was<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.519> reaction

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
and I asked him so what was a reaction

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.610 
and I asked him so what was a reaction
of<00:01:05.120> coach<00:01:05.300> Howard<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.110> that's<00:01:06.260> what<00:01:06.409> happen

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
of coach Howard and that's what happen

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.440 
of coach Howard and that's what happen
he<00:01:06.680> said<00:01:06.800> he<00:01:07.100> gave<00:01:07.220> me<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.430> big<00:01:07.670> white<00:01:07.880> wet

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
he said he gave me a big white wet

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.219 
he said he gave me a big white wet
sloppy<00:01:08.750> kiss<00:01:09.610> sofa<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:11.270> was<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.420> guess<00:01:11.990> it's

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
sloppy kiss sofa that was I guess it's

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.660 
sloppy kiss sofa that was I guess it's
something<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.620> don't<00:01:12.770> associate<00:01:13.220> with<00:01:13.340> Frank

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
something you don't associate with Frank

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.340 
something you don't associate with Frank
Howard<00:01:13.909> all<00:01:14.420> right<00:01:14.510> obviously<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.200> last

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
Howard all right obviously the last

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.080 
Howard all right obviously the last
three<00:01:15.710> matchups<00:01:16.040> between<00:01:16.430> these<00:01:16.760> two<00:01:16.940> teams

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
three matchups between these two teams

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.980 
three matchups between these two teams
all<00:01:17.540> have<00:01:17.930> gone<00:01:18.140> into<00:01:18.380> overtime<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.600> think

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
all have gone into overtime and I think

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.150 
all have gone into overtime and I think
we're<00:01:21.140> expecting<00:01:21.500> another<00:01:21.590> close<00:01:21.890> game<00:01:21.920> here

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
we're expecting another close game here

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.010 
we're expecting another close game here
this<00:01:22.370> week<00:01:22.580> yeah<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:22.850> think<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.420> there's<00:01:23.960> only

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
this week yeah I think so there's only

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.630 
this week yeah I think so there's only
one<00:01:24.170> of<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.470> series<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.070> college<00:01:25.430> football

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
one of the series in college football

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.670 
one of the series in college football
that's<00:01:26.060> had<00:01:26.270> three<00:01:26.600> consecutive<00:01:27.110> overtime

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
that's had three consecutive overtime

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.070 
that's had three consecutive overtime
meetings<00:01:28.250> that's<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:29.060> central<00:01:29.510> michigan<00:01:29.810> and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
meetings that's a central michigan and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.930 
meetings that's a central michigan and
eastern<00:01:30.380> michigan<00:01:30.860> from<00:01:31.130> two<00:01:31.310> thousand<00:01:31.730> four

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
eastern michigan from two thousand four

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.490 
eastern michigan from two thousand four
to<00:01:32.090> two<00:01:32.210> thousand<00:01:32.630> six<00:01:32.810> they<00:01:33.020> had<00:01:33.200> three

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
to two thousand six they had three

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.190 
to two thousand six they had three
straight<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:34.070> know<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.910> Clemson<00:01:35.450> Miami<00:01:35.780> series

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
straight I know the Clemson Miami series

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.050 
straight I know the Clemson Miami series
hasn't<00:01:36.380> been<00:01:36.620> three<00:01:36.830> consecutive<00:01:37.190> years<00:01:37.460> but

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
hasn't been three consecutive years but

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.570 
hasn't been three consecutive years but
each<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.930> last<00:01:39.110> three<00:01:39.350> meetings<00:01:39.680> and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
each of the last three meetings and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.880 
each of the last three meetings and
what's<00:01:41.030> really<00:01:41.330> weird<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:42.260> visiting<00:01:42.680> team

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
what's really weird is the visiting team

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.590 
what's really weird is the visiting team
has<00:01:42.920> won<00:01:43.400> all<00:01:43.640> three<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.060> those<00:01:44.300> who<00:01:44.510> would

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
has won all three of those who would

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.120 
has won all three of those who would
think<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:44.930> over<00:01:45.050> time<00:01:45.320> maybe<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.830> crowd

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
think it over time maybe that crowd

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.810 
think it over time maybe that crowd
would<00:01:46.340> make<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.640> difference<00:01:47.350> but<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
would make the difference but the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.360 
would make the difference but the
