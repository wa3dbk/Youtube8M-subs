00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.360
 how about friends this week we will respond 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.760
 to a question that many 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.930
 women who practice indoor cycling 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 If I do indoor cycling, I will grow 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.260
 Thighs to sharp questions answers 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.670
 forceful not to disprove this myth 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 we will go to the concept of hypertrophy 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 muscular the muscular hypertrophy is the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.100
 scientific name given to the phenomenon of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.250
 growth in cell size 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 muscles , which means an increase in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 size of muscle fibers and by 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.440
 so much of the muscle technically is the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.009
 growth of muscle cells 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.610
 without there being a cell division 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:18.640
 muscle subjected to this change offers 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.460
 equally a better response to the load 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.110
 this phenomenon is usually found in 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.350
 muscles of those athletes that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.960
 practice anaerobic sports and in 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.600
 which is repeated successively the same 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.520
 exercise as they are for example the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.450
 bodybuilding and weightlifting 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.909
 already at the beginning to say the indoor cycle is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.420
 a mainly aerobic activity 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.329
 so we can go ruling out the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.990
 possibility of growth hypertrophy 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.360
 muscle we can also consolidate yet 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.069
 more these arguments if we have in 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.439
 account that for this to exist 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.700
 muscle growth our body 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.929
 you need a specific diet 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.500
 fundamentally as far as the contribution 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.750
 protein is said said this any 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.630
 practitioner of the indoor cycle that follows 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.090
 normal feeding patterns and 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.250
 that also work in their sessions 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.730
 within some aerobic parameters 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.709
 normal regardless of whether they exist 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.410
 peaks of effort a little bit more 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.739
 intense than normal to take you to 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.019
 controlled phases of anaerobic work 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.269
 you do not have to be afraid of 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.660
 that your muscles develop from 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.390
 exaggerated way is to say also that 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.000
 some kinds of indoor cycle 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.450
 where you work with high 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.540
 intensities 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.849
 and with an interval and work system 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.810
 with can have a high index of 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.640
 Plasma sarko hypertrophy is a 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.000
 activity with very high number of 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.489
 repetitions the first weeks is 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.310
 possible to observe the legs more 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.280
 swollen due to adaptations 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.440
 physiological muscles but still the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.019
 visual response of practitioners of 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.420
 this type of sessions is usually from 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.930
 reduction of body measurements 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.400
 due to the high caloric expenditure of the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:25.240
 classes so girls yes to the indoor cycle 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.570
 and not the fear of developing your muscles 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.300
 and good greetings and tell you that we 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.340
 We see you back here next week 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.340
 instead of killing civic
