ah<00:00:00.060> run<00:00:00.599> burrowed<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.079> then<00:00:01.170> you<00:00:01.260> fall<00:00:01.500> back

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
ah run burrowed and then you fall back

ah run burrowed and then you fall back
away<00:00:02.490> from<00:00:02.700> them<00:00:02.820> so<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.060> take<00:00:03.689> as<00:00:03.840> little

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
away from them so you take as little

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.019 
away from them so you take as little
damage<00:00:04.140> as<00:00:04.350> possible<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.460> can<00:00:05.609> still<00:00:05.700> do

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
damage as possible and you can still do

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.190 
damage as possible and you can still do
damage<00:00:06.359> while<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.600> lurkers<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:06.960> pushing

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
damage while the lurkers are pushing

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.360 
damage while the lurkers are pushing
forward<00:00:07.470> that's<00:00:07.589> exactly<00:00:07.950> what's<00:00:08.130> been<00:00:08.189> doing

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
forward that's exactly what's been doing

forward that's exactly what's been doing
and<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.519> can<00:00:08.639> see<00:00:08.790> how<00:00:09.420> little<00:00:09.870> quantum<00:00:10.230> has

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and you can see how little quantum has

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.650 
and you can see how little quantum has
advanced<00:00:10.860> because<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.790> micro<00:00:12.120> flash<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
advanced because of that micro flash and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.690 
advanced because of that micro flash and
in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.049> time<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.500> taken<00:00:13.559> him<00:00:13.799> imagine<00:00:14.580> if

even<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.560> ton<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> lurkers<00:01:44.490> it'll<00:01:44.969> still

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
even with a ton of lurkers it'll still

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.749 
even with a ton of lurkers it'll still
be<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.689> difficult<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.229> him<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:47.490> break

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
be really difficult for him to to break

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
be really difficult for him to to break
that<00:01:48.030> many<00:01:48.270> Marines<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.780> tanks<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.229> well

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that many Marines with tanks as well

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.969 
that many Marines with tanks as well
with<00:01:49.560> vessels<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.130> well<00:01:50.210> he'll<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.390> need<00:01:51.539> to

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
with vessels as well he'll just need to

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.350 
with vessels as well he'll just need to
turn<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.189> weather<00:01:53.340> doing<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:53.670> days<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
turn to weather doing these days is just

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450 
turn to weather doing these days is just
kind<00:01:54.539> of<00:01:54.569> spreading<00:01:55.289> out<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:55.829> means<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.280> lot

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
kind of spreading out there means a lot

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.859 
kind of spreading out there means a lot
so<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.819> hard<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> lurkers<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> get

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
so it's hard for the lurkers to get

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
so it's hard for the lurkers to get
multiple<00:01:58.049> hits<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.619> these<00:01:58.770> spine<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.399> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
multiple hits with these spine and it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.960 
multiple hits with these spine and it's
going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.539> really<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:01.079> effective<00:02:01.970> to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970

the wall or something like that but um
yeah<00:04:35.250> flash<00:04:35.639> is<00:04:36.389> always<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.020> eliminating

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
yeah flash is always just eliminating

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.469 
yeah flash is always just eliminating
cuanto<00:04:38.100> from<00:04:38.250> things<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:39.000> seems<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.389> be

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
cuanto from things and it seems to be

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.860 
cuanto from things and it seems to be
the<00:04:39.720> stumbling<00:04:40.080> block<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.870> quandary

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
the stumbling block that that a quandary

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.260 
the stumbling block that that a quandary
could<00:04:43.050> not<00:04:43.229> get<00:04:43.680> quite<00:04:44.070> get<00:04:44.280> past<00:04:44.520> he's<00:04:45.240> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
could not get quite get past he's a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.670 
could not get quite get past he's a
transfer<00:04:45.570> some<00:04:45.900> drones<00:04:46.200> somewhere<00:04:46.530> did<00:04:46.620> he

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
transfer some drones somewhere did he

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.960 
transfer some drones somewhere did he
get<00:04:46.800> out<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.979> base<00:04:47.160> up<00:04:47.370> maybe<00:04:47.550> cloner<00:04:47.820> got

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
get out of base up maybe cloner got

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.850 
get out of base up maybe cloner got
another<00:04:48.210> base<00:04:48.389> up<00:04:48.600> in<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.260> top<00:04:49.500> right<00:04:49.770> it

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
another base up in the top right it

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.930 
another base up in the top right it
looks<00:04:50.010> like<00:04:50.160> yeah<00:04:50.340> he's<00:04:50.490> got<00:04:50.610> another<00:04:50.789> base

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
looks like yeah he's got another base

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.450 
looks like yeah he's got another base
going<00:04:51.800> looks<00:04:52.800> like<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.010> hatchery<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.310> not

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
going looks like the hatchery is not

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.770 
going looks like the hatchery is not
quite<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.760> yet<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.060> it's<00:04:54.180> close<00:04:54.479> enough<00:04:54.510> that

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
quite in yet but it's close enough that

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.120 
quite in yet but it's close enough that
he<00:04:54.930> can<00:04:55.020> transfer<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.440> drones<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.770> he<00:04:55.860> really

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
he can transfer the drones and he really

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.529 
he can transfer the drones and he really
didn't<00:04:56.310> have<00:04:56.370> any<00:04:56.520> other<00:04:56.580> top<00:04:56.849> opportunity<00:04:57.450> to

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
didn't have any other top opportunity to

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.029 
didn't have any other top opportunity to
transfer<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> drones<00:04:58.169> because<00:04:58.380> very<00:04:58.830> soon

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
transfer the drones because very soon

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.650 
transfer the drones because very soon
these<00:04:59.700> forces<00:04:59.910> are<00:05:00.000> gonna<00:05:00.120> be<00:05:00.270> coming<00:05:00.389> in<00:05:00.630> here

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
ultrasound now he's gonna try and charge

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.469 
ultrasound now he's gonna try and charge
out<00:05:13.919> but<00:05:14.070> his<00:05:14.190> own<00:05:14.370> choke<00:05:14.760> point<00:05:15.030> making<00:05:15.270> it

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
out but his own choke point making it

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.240 
out but his own choke point making it
hard<00:05:15.660> for<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.900> oceans<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.380> get<00:05:16.500> in<00:05:16.620> there<00:05:16.770> he's

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
hard for the oceans to get in there he's

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.920 
hard for the oceans to get in there he's
not<00:05:17.460> able<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:17.820> get<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.030> ton<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.360> Units<00:05:18.660> look<00:05:18.840> at

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
not able to get a ton of Units look at

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.510 
not able to get a ton of Units look at
his<00:05:19.020> own<00:05:19.200> zerglings<00:05:19.830> are<00:05:19.919> prevented<00:05:20.520> from

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.950 
his own zerglings are prevented from
attacking<00:05:20.940> because<00:05:21.330> they're<00:05:21.450> behind<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.840> old

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
attacking because they're behind the old

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.719 
attacking because they're behind the old
was<00:05:22.200> attacking<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.889> that<00:05:23.010> small<00:05:23.250> choke<00:05:23.550> and

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
was attacking to that small choke and

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.550 
was attacking to that small choke and
now<00:05:24.389> these<00:05:24.599> marines<00:05:24.930> are<00:05:25.080> going<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.260> come<00:05:25.410> up

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
and attack that top right expansion and

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.930 
and attack that top right expansion and
it<00:05:28.200> looks<00:05:28.380> like<00:05:28.440> quano<00:05:28.800> may<00:05:29.190> not<00:05:29.370> even<00:05:29.550> clean

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
it looks like quano may not even clean

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.940 
it looks like quano may not even clean
up<00:05:30.090> his<00:05:30.300> natural<00:05:30.720> expansion<00:05:30.990> oh<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.770> last

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
maybe I'll clean that up and push it

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.719 
maybe I'll clean that up and push it
back<00:05:36.330> but<00:05:37.050> it's<00:05:37.289> yes<00:05:37.979> he<00:05:38.010> is<00:05:38.250> gonna<00:05:38.460> push<00:05:38.700> it

back but it's yes he is gonna push it
back<00:05:38.970> but<00:05:39.180> he's<00:05:39.300> lost<00:05:39.539> so<00:05:40.110> much<00:05:40.410> he's<00:05:40.650> lost<00:05:40.830> two

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
back but he's lost so much he's lost two

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.490 
back but he's lost so much he's lost two
bases<00:05:41.520> now<00:05:41.690> flash<00:05:42.690> is<00:05:42.960> getting<00:05:43.260> his<00:05:43.349> third

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
bases now flash is getting his third

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.450 
bases now flash is getting his third
look<00:05:43.710> at<00:05:43.770> that

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
look at that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.050 
look at that
freakin<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:44.880> robot<00:05:45.410> absolutely<00:05:46.669> just<00:05:47.669> playing

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
freakin of robot absolutely just playing

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.379 
freakin of robot absolutely just playing
perfectly<00:05:48.569> and<00:05:49.460> does<00:05:50.460> not<00:05:50.639> even<00:05:50.789> seem<00:05:51.060> fazed

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
perfectly and does not even seem fazed

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.960 
perfectly and does not even seem fazed
by<00:05:51.509> the<00:05:51.630> turn<00:05:51.840> events<00:05:51.930> he<00:05:52.830> looks<00:05:53.250> concentrated

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
by the turn events he looks concentrated

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.689 
by the turn events he looks concentrated
but<00:05:54.120> just<00:05:54.360> does<00:05:54.539> not<00:05:54.660> look<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:55.110> be<00:05:55.699> flapping

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
but just does not look to be flapping

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.870 
but just does not look to be flapping
belen<00:05:57.150> anyway<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:58.620> now<00:05:58.889> he's<00:05:59.130> got<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.340> four

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
belen anyway and now he's got a four

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.240 
belen anyway and now he's got a four
vessels<00:06:00.300> out<00:06:00.479> he's<00:06:01.050> protecting<00:06:02.009> them<00:06:02.099> while

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
vessels out he's protecting them while

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.710 
vessels out he's protecting them while
he's<00:06:02.370> got<00:06:02.490> his<00:06:02.550> third<00:06:02.880> base<00:06:03.120> going<00:06:03.449> right<00:06:03.599> now

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
he's got his third base going right now

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.270 
he's got his third base going right now
looks<00:06:04.380> like<00:06:04.500> he's<00:06:04.620> going<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.830> temporarily

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
looks like he's going to temporarily
