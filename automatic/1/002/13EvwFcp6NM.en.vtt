00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 it was a day like the others to do 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.359
 upton he was going to do some 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 ass stirs online as usual 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.349
 he forced his way into the ass to take the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 his beloved lazer and bring the apocalypse 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.460
 on the ground but I give you an ass for that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.539
 brown you won't even understand what there is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.330
 success quietly killed some 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.279
 player seemed all right 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.199
 and as always he was enjoying himself 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.529
 also because obviously nobody succeeded 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.090
 to bring it down but suddenly it happened 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.090
 something that changes everything 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 wanted to escape you would have liked 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.580
 no 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.829
 but that happened when said lippi a 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.510
 an explosion that came from nowhere 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.239
 probably a divine punishment 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.670
 he destroyed him and his lazer raptor 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.350
 he found himself back on the ground a little disoriented 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.659
 because what had happened was not 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.550
 just normal being provident and 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.210
 immediately decided to resign in mode 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.190
 passive was the only right thing to do 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.899
 now everything seemed normal apart 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.140
 some pedestrians are not very good at driving 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.300
 when at some point from nothing 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.300
 the ghost dog appeared 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
 then our protagonist decided 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.090
 resume his armored curve but 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.319
 someone didn't agree again 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.759
 from nothing 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.460
 compare a savage with a 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.020
 grenade launcher leaves no escape for 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.530
 then disappear at the same speed with 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.780
 which had appeared alone without his 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.880
 vehicle made to the cisa then to steal 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.399
 any car from the road and everything 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.619
 went for the best group but not for 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.110
 very 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.670
 at some point suddenly yes 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.869
 he found a few hundred meters of 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.539
 distance 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.340
 but the most disturbing thing is that he saw 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.980
 an invisible presence leaving the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.870
 vehicle that he had stolen to pure therefore 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.150
 that the vehicle was cursed and it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.610
 in the meantime he abandoned another 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.500
 player was approaching ours 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
 the protagonist then decided to take off 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.220
 passive mode delete it 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.510
 he succeeded without too many problems 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.319
 of access c4 but again from nothing 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.879
 the dog reappeared 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.370
 but this time it didn't look like it 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.040
 aggressive was just motionless to 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.230
 suddenly observe again 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.239
 another savage appeared 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.860
 this time armed with miniguns that don't 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.769
 he thinks twice before shooting at 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.540
 act as if it were not enough 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.489
 respo born thanks miracles of reality 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.470
 virtual was invested by another 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.299
 player intent on escaping from 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.890
 police 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.379
 everything seems quiet for some 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.480
 a minute ago he could n't get together with a 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.129
 member of his prius presents its entities 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.870
 of and started running faster than that 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.900
 he could but he soon realized that he was n't there 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.000
 his car apparently escapes 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.620
 He did not agree 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.659
 appeared in the void and reappeared some 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.609
 Seconds later a few meters nearby 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.939
 as if it existed take the game of 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.799
 fanapt online owner I was in that 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.599
 he had preferred to try his hand at one 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.079
 fast manhunt with the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.629
 his sniper rifle but again 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.099
 something was wrong abroad too 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.409
 was against our protagonist and the 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.810
 its first appearance from nothing trying to 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.459
 kill an ally rpg shots but 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.560
 this time he did something he didn't do 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.959
 overwhelm in a fraction of a second 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.699
 took aim and cold leicester with a 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.709
 sniper shot 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.629
 after this event everything calmed down 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.739
 the evil spirit that was 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.169
 persecuting our protagonist 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.069
 decided to leave him alone and to 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.019
 change target 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.750
 the other players could hear us 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.549
 indeed complaining of a certain moder 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.510
 that was the spirit's name 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.510
 probably 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.340
 oh but what a flour they make me water flour 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.500
 the car even came out the winner 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.780
 car fans will never forget this 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.590
 supernatural experience that does not happen 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.590
 then every day
