you<00:02:06.410> feel<00:02:06.590> about<00:02:06.940> maybe<00:02:07.990> we're<00:02:08.990> talking<00:02:09.229> about

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
you feel about maybe we're talking about

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.859 
you feel about maybe we're talking about
spying<00:02:09.619> rollers<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.130> using<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.429> defense

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
spying rollers and using the defense

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.960 
spying rollers and using the defense
what<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:11.530> they<00:02:11.680> had<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> little<00:02:12.670> bit<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:12.879> a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
what if they had a little bit of a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.720 
what if they had a little bit of a
shorter<00:02:13.620> time<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:15.159> possible<00:02:15.580> it's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
shorter time it's possible it's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.710 
shorter time it's possible it's
something<00:02:15.940> we've<00:02:16.060> looked<00:02:16.150> at<00:02:16.269> before<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.599> did

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
something we've looked at before we did

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.539 
something we've looked at before we did
something<00:02:16.900> we've<00:02:17.560> been<00:02:17.590> dissin<00:02:18.099> recently

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
something we've been dissin recently

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.580 
something we've been dissin recently
with<00:02:18.700> more<00:02:18.940> colors<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.959> sense<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.500> was

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
with more colors in that sense that was

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.050 
with more colors in that sense that was
more<00:02:20.709> possible<00:02:21.099> we<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.549> want<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.849> some

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
more possible we do want to have some

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.430 
more possible we do want to have some
choices<00:02:22.269> for<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.659> there<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> don't<00:02:23.290> know

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
choices for you there so I don't know

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.839 
choices for you there so I don't know
what<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> exact<00:02:23.920> right<00:02:24.099> numbers<00:02:24.430> will<00:02:24.549> be<00:02:24.670> but

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
what the exact right numbers will be but

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.789 
what the exact right numbers will be but
something<00:02:25.090> two<00:02:25.209> certainly<00:02:25.450> look<00:02:25.510> at<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:26.590> or

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
something two certainly look at that or

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.039 
something two certainly look at that or
maybe<00:02:27.519> making<00:02:27.909> them<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> little<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.569> faster<00:02:28.690> to

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
maybe making them a little bit faster to

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.780 
maybe making them a little bit faster to
build<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.650> impostor<00:02:30.159> they're<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:30.610> very

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
build the impostor they're not very

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.030 
build the impostor they're not very
reactive<00:02:31.269> right<00:02:31.659> now<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.079> can't<00:02:32.409> react

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
reactive right now like you can't react

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.559 
reactive right now like you can't react
and<00:02:33.220> build<00:02:33.400> spine<00:02:33.640> photos<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.150> never<00:02:34.390> get

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and build spine photos they never get

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.149 
and build spine photos they never get
there<00:02:34.690> sure<00:02:34.810> sure<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.739> seen<00:02:35.950> some

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
there sure sure we have seen some

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.440 
there sure sure we have seen some
scenarios<00:02:36.519> where<00:02:36.640> players<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
scenarios where players have that in the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.610 
scenarios where players have that in the
end<00:02:37.540> game<00:02:37.690> I'd<00:02:37.840> ministry<00:02:38.140> something<00:02:38.440> that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
end game I'd ministry something that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.649 
end game I'd ministry something that
flooding<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.310> map<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.730> tons<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.360> tons<00:02:40.510> of

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
flooding the map with tons and tons of

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.869 
flooding the map with tons and tons of
spine<00:02:40.840> colors<00:02:41.140> just<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.470> slow<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.340> rush<00:02:42.519> long

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
spine colors just to slow the rush long

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.550 
spine colors just to slow the rush long
enough<00:02:43.209> for<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> Zerg<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.750> repop<00:02:44.079> their<00:02:44.290> army

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
enough for the Zerg to repop their army

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.800 
enough for the Zerg to repop their army
which<00:02:44.950> wondered<00:02:45.250> food<00:02:45.400> once<00:02:45.609> again<00:02:45.849> so<00:02:46.060> they

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
which wondered food once again so they

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.000 
which wondered food once again so they
have<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.079> their<00:02:47.200> place<00:02:47.379> but<00:02:47.410> yeah<00:02:47.709> maybe<00:02:47.890> we

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
have in their place but yeah maybe we

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.080 
have in their place but yeah maybe we
can<00:02:48.129> make<00:02:48.220> some<00:02:48.370> adjustments<00:02:48.849> making<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
can make some adjustments making a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.309 
can make some adjustments making a
little<00:02:49.299> more<00:02:49.420> earlier<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.780> don't<00:02:50.079> know<00:02:50.140> for

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
little more earlier I don't know for

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.170 
little more earlier I don't know for
sure<00:02:50.349> but<00:02:50.560> somebody<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.579> can<00:02:51.700> take<00:02:51.849> 10

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
sure but somebody that you can take 10

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.610 
sure but somebody that you can take 10
seconds<00:02:52.569> earlier<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.079> tools<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> would

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
seconds earlier in the tools and would

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.710 
seconds earlier in the tools and would
be<00:02:53.709> like<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> think<00:02:55.359> we<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.480> had

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
be like what I think we have had

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.420 
be like what I think we have had
problems<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.109> spine<00:02:56.319> closed<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.769> past<00:02:57.010> is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
problems the spine closed in the past is

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.099 
problems the spine closed in the past is
a<00:02:57.489> lot<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.879> early<00:02:58.120> zerg<00:02:58.329> vs<00:02:58.629> zerg<00:02:58.750> brushes

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
a lot of the early zerg vs zerg brushes

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.990 
a lot of the early zerg vs zerg brushes
that<00:02:59.530> was<00:03:00.040> pretty<00:03:00.220> informative<00:03:00.609> remember<00:03:00.940> in

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
that was pretty informative remember in

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000 
that was pretty informative remember in
the<00:03:01.060> very<00:03:01.209> early<00:03:01.359> beta<00:03:01.720> there<00:03:02.590> was<00:03:02.680> possibly

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the very early beta there was possibly

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.680 
the very early beta there was possibly
even<00:03:03.099> before<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.579> baby<00:03:03.730> went<00:03:03.970> out<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.480> very

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
even before the baby went out was very

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.020 
even before the baby went out was very
possible<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.200> put<00:03:05.409> out<00:03:05.530> spine<00:03:06.310> colors<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.760> cbc

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
possible to put out spine colors in cbc

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.570 
possible to put out spine colors in cbc
and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.220 
and
Lincoln<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:07.970> word<00:03:08.150> shenanigans<00:03:08.330> there<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.110> you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
Lincoln of word shenanigans there so you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.540 
Lincoln of word shenanigans there so you
have<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.410> be<00:03:09.470> careful<00:03:09.620> with<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:10.280> can't<00:03:10.460> just

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
have to be careful with it we can't just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.310 
have to be careful with it we can't just
make<00:03:10.700> them<00:03:10.790> super<00:03:10.940> fast<00:03:11.270> everything's<00:03:12.050> okay

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
make them super fast everything's okay

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.260 
make them super fast everything's okay
they<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.890> break<00:03:13.100> some<00:03:13.460> of<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> matchups<00:03:14.060> but

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
they can break some of the matchups but

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.090 
they can break some of the matchups but
we<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.510> look<00:03:14.540> at<00:03:14.750> yeah<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.230> mean<00:03:15.440> yeah<00:03:16.070> that's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
we can look at yeah I mean yeah that's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.550 
we can look at yeah I mean yeah that's
that<00:03:16.520> could<00:03:16.940> be<00:03:17.090> an<00:03:17.180> issue<00:03:17.270> but<00:03:17.450> not<00:03:18.260> really<00:03:18.440> I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
that could be an issue but not really I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.500 
that could be an issue but not really I
mean<00:03:18.800> like<00:03:19.100> if<00:03:19.520> it's<00:03:19.700> like<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.910> six<00:03:20.210> full<00:03:20.420> with

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
mean like if it's like a six full with

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.480 
mean like if it's like a six full with
its<00:03:20.660> micro<00:03:20.990> tourism<00:03:21.290> like<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.620> should<00:03:22.460> be

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
its micro tourism like that should be

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.340 
its micro tourism like that should be
able<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.420> little<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:23.930> drills<00:03:24.140> right

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
able to just little get drills right

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.170 
able to just little get drills right
fast<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:25.040> could<00:03:25.190> be<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> pro<00:03:25.460> right<00:03:25.670> yeah<00:03:25.910> if

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
fast it could be a pro right yeah if

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.440 
fast it could be a pro right yeah if
it's<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.540> like<00:03:26.720> 10<00:03:26.990> or<00:03:27.110> 5<00:03:27.260> second<00:03:28.450> reactive

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
it's just like 10 or 5 second reactive

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.040 
it's just like 10 or 5 second reactive
or<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.230> other<00:03:30.380> matchups<00:03:31.390> that's<00:03:32.390> great<00:03:32.630> what

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
or the other matchups that's great what

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.900 
or the other matchups that's great what
about<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.290> new<00:03:33.470> maps<00:03:33.710> a<00:03:34.070> lot<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:34.550> people<00:03:34.790> have

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
about the new maps a lot of people have

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
about the new maps a lot of people have
been<00:03:35.030> wondering<00:03:35.950> tournaments<00:03:36.950> like<00:03:37.070> this

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
been wondering tournaments like this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.340 
been wondering tournaments like this
then<00:03:37.520> we<00:03:37.580> use<00:03:37.730> are<00:03:38.060> probably<00:03:38.960> Falcon

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
then we use are probably Falcon

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.600 
then we use are probably Falcon
delicious<00:03:39.740> when<00:03:39.920> they<00:03:40.010> should<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.430> that's

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
delicious when they should and that's

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.580 
delicious when they should and that's
fine<00:03:40.850> we<00:03:41.300> bake<00:03:41.450> our<00:03:41.480> map<00:03:41.810> pool<00:03:42.050> for<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.350> ladder

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
fine we bake our map pool for the ladder

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.950 
fine we bake our map pool for the ladder
for<00:03:43.190> latter<00:03:43.490> players<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.360> ladder<00:03:44.630> players

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
for latter players and ladder players

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.600 
for latter players and ladder players
some<00:03:45.200> there<00:03:45.530> are<00:03:45.770> players<00:03:46.010> who<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.310> rush

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
some there are players who like to rush

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.550 
some there are players who like to rush
there<00:03:47.150> are<00:03:47.240> players<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> macro<00:03:48.140> we<00:03:48.440> do

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
there are players like the macro we do

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.470 
there are players like the macro we do
have<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.740> system<00:03:49.700> where<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:49.880> can<00:03:49.910> veto<00:03:50.120> maps

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
have a system where you can veto maps

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.090 
have a system where you can veto maps
that<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.750> don't<00:03:50.870> want<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.050> play<00:03:51.140> on<00:03:51.380> right<00:03:51.620> we

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
that you don't want to play on right we

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.560 
that you don't want to play on right we
don't<00:03:52.220> feel<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.520> ultimately<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.270> this<00:03:53.450> is

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
don't feel the ultimately and so this is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.850 
don't feel the ultimately and so this is
more<00:03:53.810> true<00:03:53.959> in<00:03:54.080> brutal<00:03:54.380> weather<00:03:54.500> i<00:03:54.620> think<00:03:54.800> it

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
more true in brutal weather i think it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.620 
more true in brutal weather i think it
is<00:03:54.890> now<00:03:55.130> but<00:03:55.340> i<00:03:55.550> think<00:03:55.820> we're<00:03:55.940> trying<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.209> see<00:03:56.390> a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
is now but i think we're trying to see a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.240 
is now but i think we're trying to see a
lot<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.290> tournament<00:03:57.740> players<00:03:57.920> making

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
lot of the tournament players making

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.580 
lot of the tournament players making
these<00:03:58.459> very<00:03:58.790> complicated<00:03:59.480> maps<00:03:59.750> with<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.260> lot

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
these very complicated maps with a lot

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.530 
these very complicated maps with a lot
of<00:04:00.620> expansions<00:04:01.459> this<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.150> not<00:04:02.270> going<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.450> work

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
of expansions this is not going to work

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.180 
of expansions this is not going to work
for<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.810> lot<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:02.930> our<00:04:03.080> ladder<00:04:03.230> players<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.830> lot<00:04:04.100> of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
for a lot of our ladder players a lot of

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.260 
for a lot of our ladder players a lot of
our<00:04:04.250> ladder<00:04:04.430> players<00:04:04.730> are<00:04:04.880> simply<00:04:05.090> going<00:04:05.180> to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
our ladder players are simply going to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.360 
our ladder players are simply going to
fail<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.510> scout<00:04:05.930> those<00:04:06.200> extra<00:04:06.500> expansions<00:04:07.010> as

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
fail to scout those extra expansions as

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.130 
fail to scout those extra expansions as
long<00:04:07.520> as<00:04:07.550> about<00:04:07.730> hiding<00:04:07.910> expansions<00:04:08.480> which<00:04:09.020> is

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
long as about hiding expansions which is

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.260 
long as about hiding expansions which is
not<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.290> probe<00:04:09.560> not<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.860> fun<00:04:10.070> game<00:04:10.280> right<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.150> we

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
not a probe not a fun game right so we

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.030 
not a probe not a fun game right so we
do<00:04:11.420> one<00:04:11.570> have<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.720> mix<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.080> maps<00:04:12.260> we<00:04:12.680> don't<00:04:12.860> feel

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
do one have a mix of maps we don't feel

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.560 
do one have a mix of maps we don't feel
like<00:04:13.160> what<00:04:13.370> happens<00:04:13.730> in<00:04:13.850> tournament<00:04:14.269> is

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
like what happens in tournament is

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.180

types of pools happening there and we're
