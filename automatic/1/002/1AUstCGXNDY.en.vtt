00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.810 
used and I found sword and shield
they're<00:00:30.689> easiest<00:00:31.349> better<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:32.040> heavy<00:00:32.310> weapon

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
they're easiest better than heavy weapon

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.900 
they're easiest better than heavy weapon
and<00:00:33.060> I<00:00:33.510> had<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.750> rare<00:00:34.110> shield<00:00:34.500> gem<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.160> assured

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and I had a rare shield gem and assured

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.980 
and I had a rare shield gem and assured
helm<00:00:36.330> and<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:37.530> highest<00:00:37.830> shield<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:38.990> defense

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990

helm and my highest shield and defense
gem<00:00:40.410> element<00:00:40.950> defense<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.210> didn't<00:00:42.630> wear

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gem element defense and I didn't wear

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.200 
gem element defense and I didn't wear
defend<00:00:43.500> magic<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.310> didn't<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:44.820> need

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
defend magic but I didn't actually need

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.690 
defend magic but I didn't actually need
that<00:00:45.350> because<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.560> had<00:00:46.920> three<00:00:47.220> get<00:00:48.230> 100<00:00:49.230> shield

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
that because I had three get 100 shield

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
that because I had three get 100 shield
potions<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.110> potion<00:00:52.440> by<00:00:53.160> using

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
potions and I made that potion by using

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.070 
potions and I made that potion by using
five<00:00:54.180> cocoons<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.080> five<00:00:55.620> rare<00:00:55.980> bulbs<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
five cocoons and five rare bulbs and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.770 
five cocoons and five rare bulbs and
about<00:00:58.080> one<00:00:58.320> every<00:00:58.650> four<00:00:58.980> tries<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.120> produced

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
about one every four tries it produced

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.270 
about one every four tries it produced
that<00:01:01.290> shield<00:01:02.280> replenish<00:01:02.880> potion<00:01:03.540> so<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that shield replenish potion so here it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090 
that shield replenish potion so here it
is<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.790> final<00:01:06.330> stage<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.229> definitely<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
is the final stage and it definitely is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.580 
is the final stage and it definitely is
a<00:01:08.130> tough<00:01:08.640> ground<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.109> with<00:01:10.320> three

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
a tough ground and it's with three

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.429 
a tough ground and it's with three
minutes<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.969> did<00:01:12.270> find<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> hardest

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
minutes and I did find it the hardest

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.480 
minutes and I did find it the hardest
one

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
one

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780 
one
out<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.150> Tony<00:01:15.649> so<00:01:16.649> you<00:01:16.710> need<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> block<00:01:17.579> at

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
out of this Tony so you need to block at

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.300 
out of this Tony so you need to block at
the<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.270> last<00:01:18.600> moment<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.710> perfect

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the very last moment to get a perfect

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
the very last moment to get a perfect
block<00:01:20.579> now<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> noticed<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.530> he<00:01:22.710> does

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
block now I noticed that when he does

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.969 
block now I noticed that when he does
that<00:01:23.280> down<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.330> move<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that down to up move from the right it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.109 
that down to up move from the right it
is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> faster<00:01:27.180> hit<00:01:27.630> than<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.649> others<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.340> be

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
is a faster hit than the others so be

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
is a faster hit than the others so be
ready<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.720> immediately<00:01:31.350> block<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
ready to immediately block that one and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.410 
ready to immediately block that one and
also<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.960> alert<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.590> his<00:01:35.100> double<00:01:35.549> hit<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
also be alert for his double hit and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.389 
also be alert for his double hit and
make<00:01:36.600> sure<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> second<00:01:37.679> hit<00:01:37.890> doesn't

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
make sure that the second hit doesn't

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.840 
make sure that the second hit doesn't
get<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.270> he<00:01:40.080> does<00:01:40.289> this<00:01:40.530> slow<00:01:40.950> overhead

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
get you and he does this slow overhead

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.450 
get you and he does this slow overhead
swipe<00:01:42.539> so<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> need<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> wait<00:01:43.830> longer<00:01:44.220> for

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
swipe so you need to wait longer for

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.859 
swipe so you need to wait longer for
that<00:01:44.820> hit<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.020> also<00:01:46.709> a<00:01:46.920> slow<00:01:47.520> down<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.330> up<00:01:48.509> hit

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that hit and also a slow down to up hit

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.809 
that hit and also a slow down to up hit
so<00:01:49.350> again<00:01:49.709> you<00:01:49.860> need<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.220> wait<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.459> bit<00:01:50.640> longer

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
so again you need to wait a bit longer

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.249 
so again you need to wait a bit longer
to<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> perfect<00:01:52.319> block<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.720> he<00:01:54.720> does<00:01:54.929> one

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to get the perfect block and he does one

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.130 
to get the perfect block and he does one
step<00:01:55.619> back<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.069> a<00:01:56.130> break<00:01:56.429> or<00:01:56.729> two<00:01:56.789> breaks<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
step back and a break or two breaks and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.609 
step back and a break or two breaks and
I<00:01:58.590> put<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> link<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.340> Auslan<00:02:00.209> step<00:02:00.630> backs<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.319> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
I put a link to Auslan step backs in the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.609 
I put a link to Auslan step backs in the
description<00:02:02.399> under<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.819> video<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:04.289> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
description under this video so I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.350 
description under this video so I
suggest<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.490> you're<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.670> sure<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
suggest that if you're not sure the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.499 
suggest that if you're not sure the
timing<00:02:06.689> better<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.530> block<00:02:08.130> early<00:02:09.119> than<00:02:09.479> late

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
timing better to block early than late

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.160 
timing better to block early than late
because<00:02:10.410> at<00:02:10.560> least<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:10.950> serve<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.340> hit<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
because at least your serve I hit and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.710 
because at least your serve I hit and
also<00:02:13.170> keep<00:02:13.530> practicing<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.480> really

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
also keep practicing because that really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.979 
also keep practicing because that really
does<00:02:15.870> help<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:16.830> used<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> timing<00:02:17.989> my

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
does help you get used to the timing my

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.880 
does help you get used to the timing my
first<00:02:19.350> couple<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.130> go

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
first couple of go

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.790 
first couple of go
were<00:02:21.100> very<00:02:21.430> poor<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.540> by<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.840> end<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.560> I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
were very poor but by the end of it I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.440 
were very poor but by the end of it I
