00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
about their new color preference this is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
about their new color preference this is
because<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> blockchain<00:01:41.970> makes<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.960> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
because the blockchain makes it really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.679 
because the blockchain makes it really
hard<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.829> change<00:01:44.250> existing<00:01:44.540> information<00:01:45.540> in

hard to change existing information in
it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.279 
it
it<00:01:47.670> takes<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> considerable<00:01:48.479> amount<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.229> time

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
it takes a considerable amount of time

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.679 
it takes a considerable amount of time
and<00:01:49.859> effort<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.579> convince<00:01:50.880> multiple<00:01:51.570> other

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and effort to convince multiple other

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.950 
and effort to convince multiple other
people<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:52.500> even<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:54.600> change

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
people or even just one this change

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.859 
people or even just one this change
would<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.859> worth<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> effort<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
would not be worth the effort this was a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
would not be worth the effort this was a
quick<00:01:58.109> overview<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.100> blockchain<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.759> its
