00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
today is we're gonna test the decibels

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.950 
today is we're gonna test the decibels
using<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.490> fancy<00:00:27.000> decibel<00:00:27.480> reader<00:00:27.630> my

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
using your fancy decibel reader my

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
and the big noise in the room surprised

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.620 
and the big noise in the room surprised
me<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.340> Vario<00:04:49.640> at<00:04:49.820> 92

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
me the Vario at 92

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.860 
me the Vario at 92
no<00:04:51.140> it's<00:04:51.470> from<00:04:51.590> 85<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.070> 92<00:04:52.490> well<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.419> know<00:04:53.570> that's

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
no it's from 85 to 92 well I know that's

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.130 
no it's from 85 to 92 well I know that's
really<00:04:54.460> 42<00:04:56.140> 47<00:04:57.140> yes<00:04:57.710> decibels<00:04:58.520> as<00:04:59.030> far<00:04:59.300> as<00:05:01.000> the

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
really 42 47 yes decibels as far as the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.920 
really 42 47 yes decibels as far as the
measurement<00:05:03.140> but<00:05:03.410> what<00:05:03.620> we<00:05:03.770> noticed<00:05:04.010> is<00:05:04.930> tone

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
measurement but what we noticed is tone

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.840 
measurement but what we noticed is tone
differences<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:07.039> kind<00:05:07.250> of<00:05:07.310> made<00:05:07.490> some<00:05:07.700> of

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
differences that kind of made some of

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.480 
differences that kind of made some of
them<00:05:07.940> seem<00:05:08.270> like<00:05:08.300> they<00:05:08.690> would<00:05:08.870> be<00:05:08.900> louder

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
them seem like they would be louder

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.909 
them seem like they would be louder
exactly<00:05:10.490> some<00:05:10.760> of<00:05:10.789> them<00:05:11.090> we<00:05:11.930> were<00:05:12.080> like<00:05:12.260> you're

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
exactly some of them we were like you're

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:13.540 
exactly some of them we were like you're
kidding

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
kidding

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.150 
kidding
yeah<00:05:14.180> or<00:05:14.479> just<00:05:14.560> vice-versa<00:05:15.560> some<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.039> them

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
yeah or just vice-versa some of them

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.500 
yeah or just vice-versa some of them
sounded<00:05:16.729> quieter<00:05:17.479> and<00:05:19.000> noise<00:05:20.000> level<00:05:20.390> was<00:05:20.419> a

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
sounded quieter and noise level was a

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.130 
sounded quieter and noise level was a
little<00:05:20.750> higher

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
little higher

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.029 
little higher
yeah<00:05:21.350> so<00:05:21.740> really<00:05:21.860> at<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.190> end<00:05:22.310> of<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.460> day<00:05:22.610> I

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
yeah so really at the end of the day I

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.200 
yeah so really at the end of the day I
mean<00:05:25.039> it<00:05:25.160> was<00:05:25.280> really<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:26.000> was<00:05:26.120> really

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
mean it was really it was really

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.380 
mean it was really it was really
basically<00:05:26.930> like<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.970> seven<00:05:28.970> decibel

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
basically like a seven decibel

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.050 
basically like a seven decibel
difference<00:05:29.810> between<00:05:30.500> all<00:05:30.650> of<00:05:30.680> them<00:05:30.919> for<00:05:31.640> me<00:05:31.760> I

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
difference between all of them for me I

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.300 
difference between all of them for me I
would<00:05:32.419> go<00:05:32.600> for<00:05:32.990> which<00:05:33.320> one<00:05:33.560> is<00:05:33.740> gonna<00:05:33.890> be<00:05:34.100> have

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
would go for which one is gonna be have

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.920 
would go for which one is gonna be have
the<00:05:34.430> best<00:05:34.610> quality<00:05:34.760> of<00:05:35.030> grind<00:05:35.390> yeah

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
the best quality of grind yeah

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.760 
the best quality of grind yeah
reliability<00:05:38.260> how<00:05:39.260> would<00:05:39.410> they<00:05:39.500> wear<00:05:39.650> the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
reliability how would they wear the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.170 
reliability how would they wear the
beans<00:05:39.950> gonna<00:05:40.250> flow<00:05:40.490> through<00:05:40.850> it<00:05:41.000> all

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
beans gonna flow through it all

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.730 
beans gonna flow through it all
different<00:05:41.510> than<00:05:41.630> those<00:05:41.810> are<00:05:42.050> no<00:05:42.169> doser<00:05:42.530> those

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
different than those are no doser those

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.810 
different than those are no doser those
things<00:05:42.950> are<00:05:43.070> probably<00:05:43.160> more<00:05:43.430> important<00:05:43.789> than

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
things are probably more important than

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.700 
things are probably more important than
just<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.390> level<00:05:44.570> so<00:05:45.169> this<00:05:45.350> is<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.590> mean

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
just the level so this is I mean

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.290 
just the level so this is I mean
obviously<00:05:46.190> we're<00:05:46.370> not<00:05:46.460> scientists<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.240> we

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
obviously we're not scientists and we

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.550 
obviously we're not scientists and we
didn't<00:05:47.479> get<00:05:47.570> some<00:05:47.630> crazy<00:05:47.960> readings<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:48.500> you

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
didn't get some crazy readings so you

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.140 
didn't get some crazy readings so you
know<00:05:48.740> this<00:05:48.919> is<00:05:49.070> obviously<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.700> Seattle

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
know this is obviously the Seattle

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.510 
know this is obviously the Seattle
coffee<00:05:50.300> gear<00:05:50.510> practical<00:05:51.050> approach

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
coffee gear practical approach
