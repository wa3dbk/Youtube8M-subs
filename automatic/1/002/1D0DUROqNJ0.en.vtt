 hello i'm laurent pq and block 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.369
 battery ligne.fr suite 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.539
 substantive comment be on my blog 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.880
 I discovered a drummer called 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.510
 virgilio nick and so I listened to a 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.000
 solo tea on a youtube video and in 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.040
 this solo he makes a thread on big 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.110
 crate snare charleston where i 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.500
 absolutely nothing understood at first 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.660
 listening 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.090
 so I had to listen to it in slow motion 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 to get to the shell and so I 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.180
 you book today precisely the 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.800
 solution with the partitions and the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.780
 fingering so that you too can 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.760
 want it I'll start with you the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.070
 play at 40 beats per minute then 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.540
 then 70 and finally 90 beats by 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.320
 minute for you see what that gives to 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.120
 different speeds 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 knowing that in introducing this 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.700
 video I was pretty much at 100 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.619
 beats per minute 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.679
 here I leave you with the film in 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.679
 question 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.140

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.810
