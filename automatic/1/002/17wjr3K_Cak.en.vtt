00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.330 
little he's a fancy lad now I can't
think<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.269> misuse<00:02:41.660> for<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.900> right<00:02:42.049> now

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
think of misuse for it right now

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.650 
think of misuse for it right now
basically<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.519> lost<00:02:43.730> my<00:02:43.880> hat<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.299> haven't<00:02:44.480> do

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
basically I lost my hat so I haven't do

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.830 
basically I lost my hat so I haven't do
something<00:02:44.900> different<00:02:52.299> textures<00:02:53.299> not<00:02:53.420> bad<00:02:53.660> is

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
something different textures not bad is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.690 
something different textures not bad is
it<00:02:54.340> no<00:02:55.340> it's<00:02:55.580> much<00:02:55.730> more<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:58.280> feels<00:02:58.489> like

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
it no it's much more it feels like

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.690 
it no it's much more it feels like
there's<00:02:58.880> more<00:02:59.380> wheat<00:03:00.380> product<00:03:00.830> in<00:03:00.950> there<00:03:01.160> yeah

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
there's more wheat product in there yeah

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.759 
there's more wheat product in there yeah
something<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.420> keep<00:03:02.690> them<00:03:02.900> firm<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
something to keep them firm yeah the

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.699 
something to keep them firm yeah the
starch<00:03:04.069> corn<00:03:04.580> starch<00:03:04.849> okay<00:03:05.470> but<00:03:06.470> they<00:03:06.590> are

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
starch corn starch okay but they are

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.460 
starch corn starch okay but they are
very<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.670> was<00:03:08.180> expecting<00:03:08.720> them<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.870> be<00:03:09.049> slightly

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
very I was expecting them to be slightly

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.890 
very I was expecting them to be slightly
more<00:03:09.650> gelatinous<00:03:10.370> yes<00:03:10.910> exactly<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.660> they're

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
more gelatinous yes exactly and they're

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.479 
more gelatinous yes exactly and they're
more<00:03:12.049> they're<00:03:12.320> definitely<00:03:12.590> more<00:03:12.950> starchy

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
more they're definitely more starchy

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.720 
more they're definitely more starchy
like<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:14.769> gnocchi<00:03:15.769> yeah<00:03:16.640> yoky<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.840> perfect

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
like a gnocchi yeah yoky is the perfect

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.520 
like a gnocchi yeah yoky is the perfect
perfect<00:03:19.730> comparison<00:03:20.480> as<00:03:20.959> far<00:03:21.170> as<00:03:21.260> texture

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
perfect comparison as far as texture

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.949 
perfect comparison as far as texture
goes<00:03:21.769> yeah<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.359> sort<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:24.549> pork

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
goes yeah so it's like sort of a pork

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.039 
goes yeah so it's like sort of a pork
milky<00:03:26.959> paste<00:03:28.150> that's<00:03:29.150> not<00:03:29.329> bad<00:03:29.510> don't<00:03:29.840> think

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
milky paste that's not bad don't think

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.690 
milky paste that's not bad don't think
incinerate<00:03:30.500> man<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.859> might<00:03:31.130> make<00:03:31.280> me<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> brain

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
incinerate man I might make me a brain

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.599 
incinerate man I might make me a brain
sandwich<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.299> yeah<00:03:32.630> like<00:03:33.170> yeah<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:37.400> can<00:03:37.519> make

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
sandwich it yeah like yeah you can make

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.550 
sandwich it yeah like yeah you can make
a<00:03:37.670> brain<00:03:37.940> jambalaya<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.950> would<00:03:40.100> probably

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
a brain jambalaya that would probably

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.050 
a brain jambalaya that would probably
surprise<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.920> isn't<00:03:43.190> like<00:03:43.280> over-salting<00:03:43.940> or

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
surprise it isn't like over-salting or

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.059 
surprise it isn't like over-salting or
anything<00:03:44.239> yeah<00:03:44.930> most<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.709> things<00:03:45.859> we<00:03:45.980> get

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
anything yeah most of the things we get

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.539 
anything yeah most of the things we get
in<00:03:46.190> cans<00:03:46.430> are<00:03:46.670> ridiculously<00:03:47.569> salty<00:03:48.160> okay<00:03:49.160> so

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
in cans are ridiculously salty okay so

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.190 
in cans are ridiculously salty okay so
pork<00:03:50.030> brains<00:03:51.190> delicious
