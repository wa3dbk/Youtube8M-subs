Austin<00:00:39.300> trout<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.860> opinion<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
Austin trout in my opinion I think it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
Austin trout in my opinion I think it
would<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.450> closer<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.200> won't<00:00:43.770> be

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
would be a lot closer I won't be

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940 
would be a lot closer I won't be
surprised<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> draw<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.500> Kota<00:00:46.500> wins<00:00:46.710> i

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
surprised if the draw but if Kota wins i

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190 
surprised if the draw but if Kota wins i
don't<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.340> i<00:00:47.610> want<00:00:48.570> thing<00:00:48.660> he<00:00:48.780> won<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
don't think i want thing he won the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350 
don't think i want thing he won the
fight<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> draw<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.760> understandable

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
fight but a draw it's understandable

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.229 
fight but a draw it's understandable
because<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:52.050> were<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> lot<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.940> post<00:00:53.940> rounds

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
because there were a lot of post rounds

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.720 
because there were a lot of post rounds
driver<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.989> least<00:00:55.140> three<00:00:55.770> close<00:00:56.039> close

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
driver like at least three close close

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.760 
driver like at least three close close
rounds<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.300> i<00:00:57.539> still<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.530> austin<00:00:58.890> top<00:00:59.039> one

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
rounds but i still think austin top one

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
rounds but i still think austin top one

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.089 
the clearer punches in my opinion and
color<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.780> able<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> land<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.469> few<00:02:07.619> body<00:02:07.829> shots

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
color was able to land a few body shots

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.150 
color was able to land a few body shots
but<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.640> didn't<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.450> hurt<00:02:10.009> Austin<00:02:11.009> trout

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
but he didn't really hurt Austin trout

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.400 
but he didn't really hurt Austin trout
that<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that much and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.580 
that much and
I<00:02:13.470> swear<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.860> ref<00:02:14.070> there<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> time<00:02:15.300> when

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
I swear the ref there was a time when

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.780 
I swear the ref there was a time when
Austin<00:02:16.590> trout<00:02:16.740> landed<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.070> body<00:02:20.340> shot<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
Austin trout landed like a body shot to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
Austin trout landed like a body shot to
the<00:02:20.910> belt<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.330> they<00:02:21.630> said<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.380> was<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.710> low<00:02:22.980> blow

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the belt and they said it was a low blow

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.860 
the belt and they said it was a low blow
I<00:02:23.220> don't<00:02:23.490> think<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> low<00:02:23.970> blow<00:02:24.000> did<00:02:24.330> he

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
I don't think I was a low blow did he

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
I don't think I was a low blow did he
want<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> ref<00:02:25.380> warned<00:02:25.740> Austin<00:02:26.160> trout<00:02:26.310> twice

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
want the ref warned Austin trout twice

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
want the ref warned Austin trout twice
why<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> think<00:02:27.630> was<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> belltown<00:02:28.350> thing

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
why I think was in the belltown thing

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.370 
why I think was in the belltown thing
was<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> low<00:02:28.950> blow<00:02:28.980> us<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.420> remember<00:02:30.570> I'm<00:02:31.230> not

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
was a low blow us I can remember I'm not

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.080 
was a low blow us I can remember I'm not
sure<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.770> really<00:02:31.920> remember<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.670> but<00:02:32.850> I

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
sure I can really remember it but I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.390

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
think that that judge was watching a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.760 
think that that judge was watching a
different<00:04:11.910> fight<00:04:12.120> i<00:04:12.150> think<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.900> who<00:04:13.620> knows

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770

like to hit Austin trout that's one of

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.400 
like to hit Austin trout that's one of
the<00:04:39.180> reasons<00:04:39.419> why<00:04:39.539> he<00:04:39.570> struggled<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.139> hit<00:04:40.259> him

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
the reasons why he struggled to hit him

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.980 
the reasons why he struggled to hit him
with<00:04:41.190> clean<00:04:41.460> shots<00:04:41.729> and<00:04:42.030> Austin<00:04:42.720> trout<00:04:42.840> was

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
with clean shots and Austin trout was

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.860 
with clean shots and Austin trout was
tall<00:04:43.229> he<00:04:43.440> was<00:04:43.710> like<00:04:43.910> 55<00:04:44.910> inches<00:04:45.210> taller<00:04:45.509> or

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
tall he was like 55 inches taller or

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.850 
tall he was like 55 inches taller or
something<00:04:46.169> like<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.440> he<00:04:46.620> had<00:04:46.740> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
something like that and he had the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.950 
something like that and he had the
longer<00:04:47.220> reach<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:48.270> for<00:04:48.419> some<00:04:48.539> reason<00:04:48.810> he

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
longer reach but for some reason he

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.249 
longer reach but for some reason he
wasn't<00:04:49.259> really<00:04:49.500> using<00:04:49.710> his<00:04:50.009> height<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:52.050> win

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
wasn't really using his height to win

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.629 
wasn't really using his height to win

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
the fight because he was fighting in the

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.700
