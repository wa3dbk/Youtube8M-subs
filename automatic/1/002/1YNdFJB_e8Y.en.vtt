and<00:00:34.920> that's<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.550> thing<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.239> liked

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and that's one thing that I really liked

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.729 
and that's one thing that I really liked
about<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.810> show<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.200> fact<00:00:37.470> that<00:00:37.530> it's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
about the show is the fact that it's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
about the show is the fact that it's
very<00:00:38.010> fast<00:00:38.400> paced<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.270> reminded<00:00:39.660> me<00:00:39.720> a<00:00:39.810> lot

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
very fast paced and it reminded me a lot

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
very fast paced and it reminded me a lot
of<00:00:40.079> No<00:00:40.350> More<00:00:40.530> Heroes<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.220> was<00:00:41.399> watching<00:00:41.790> it

of No More Heroes when I was watching it
as<00:00:42.030> far<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.630> how<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> played<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
as far as how it played out in the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.690 
as far as how it played out in the
beginning<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.770> how<00:00:43.860> she<00:00:43.920> had<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> defeat<00:00:44.489> each

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
Studio trigger who made little which
Academy<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> definitely<00:00:49.440> shows<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
Academy and it definitely shows in the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
Academy and it definitely shows in the
animation<00:00:50.370> style<00:00:50.610> though<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.600> good

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
animation style though that's a good

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.030 
animation style though that's a good
thing<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.410> animation<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.010> really

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
thing because the animation is really

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100 
thing because the animation is really
cool<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.120> course<00:00:54.420> there's<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> lot<00:00:54.989> of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
cool and of course there's a lot of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.780 
cool and of course there's a lot of
fanservice<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> show<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.550> not

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
fanservice in the show but that's not

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.700 
fanservice in the show but that's not
what<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> entire<00:00:57.300> show<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.540> about<00:00:57.690> I've<00:00:58.320> seen

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
what the entire show is about I've seen

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
what the entire show is about I've seen
shows<00:00:58.920> they're<00:00:59.160> entirely<00:00:59.489> about<00:00:59.850> fanservice

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
shows they're entirely about fanservice

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.700 
shows they're entirely about fanservice
and<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> isn't<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> them

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and this isn't really one of them

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
and this isn't really one of them
there's<00:01:02.040> mainly<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.579> thing<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> think

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
there's mainly one thing that I think

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
there's mainly one thing that I think
this<00:01:03.420> show<00:01:03.600> tackles<00:01:04.079> other<00:01:04.290> than<00:01:04.500> female

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this show tackles other than female

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
this show tackles other than female
empowerment<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> people<00:01:06.030> seen

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
empowerment which a lot of people seen

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.059 
empowerment which a lot of people seen
the<00:01:06.479> site<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:06.899> talking<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.319> the<00:01:07.590> show<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.069 
the site when talking about the show and

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:09.830 
the site when talking about the show and
that's<00:01:08.459> the<00:01:08.670> materialistic<00:01:09.479> ways<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that's the materialistic ways of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.779 
that's the materialistic ways of
humanity<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> how<00:01:10.679> close<00:01:10.979> define<00:01:11.399> our<00:01:11.579> place

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
humanity and how close define our place

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.819 
humanity and how close define our place
in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.999> society<00:01:12.569> and<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.049> lot<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.319> times<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:13.709> it

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
in the society and a lot of times how it

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.289 
in the society and a lot of times how it
shows<00:01:14.039> our<00:01:14.249> stature<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.850> mean<00:01:14.999> why<00:01:15.149> do<00:01:15.209> you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
shows our stature I mean why do you

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.639 
shows our stature I mean why do you
think<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.569> have<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> terms<00:01:16.020> blue<00:01:16.289> collar<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
think we have the terms blue collar and

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.679 
think we have the terms blue collar and
white<00:01:16.920> collar<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.670> could<00:01:17.969> search<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.299> deeper

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
white collar you could search for deeper

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.059 
white collar you could search for deeper
meanings<00:01:19.109> like<00:01:19.289> that<00:01:19.469> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.649> show<00:01:19.859> but

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
meanings like that in the show but

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.469 
meanings like that in the show but
overall<00:01:20.399> I<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:20.999> just<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.270> fun

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
overall I think it's just a really fun

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.419 
overall I think it's just a really fun
ride<00:01:21.899> with<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.319> great<00:01:22.529> humor<00:01:22.859> along<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.279> way
