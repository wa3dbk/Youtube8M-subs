00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.420
 in modern warfare 3 remembering the 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.790
 old times and who better way to 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.400
 remember those who returning to the greeting 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.830
 came to the greeting that characterized both the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.960
 channel and that many of you to a day 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.600
 after day you keep asking me to come back 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.720
 even some tell me frames like I do not 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.910
 bring me back I subscribe so for 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.160
 satisfy everyone some days 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.259
 I will do it other days not because I know that a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.569
 everyone does not like the greeting well 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.940
 how good was another day talking to 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.190
 rubén and he told me that he wanted to see again 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.559
 the furniture that we brought before the canal 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.569
 who wanted to hear me talk about what 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.300
 what we did before informing you all 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.609
 you what is happening 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.679
 year when the channel started when we were 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.690
 us super novices in this from 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.969
 youtube and we had no idea what 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.920
 do neither where to go nor how 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.170
 reach the audience that we have to day 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.719
 today so good the first fashion that 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.590
 you're going to see is rubén the second is mine 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.320
 is 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.450
 is in two minutes or less than two minutes 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.600
 I'm not very sure but it's super fast 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.190
 today post a map that is not usually seen or 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.290
 it was not usually seen better in the modern 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.210
 warfare 3 and much less running 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.490
 like crazy with the submachine gun without 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.260
 silencer was I when with him the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.050
 two games you're going to see both 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.990
 motorcycles forgiveness are saved in the mode 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.360
 cinema I wanted to apologize on behalf of the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.700
 two because before rubén only could 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.500
 capture the cinema mode and since it has 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.259
 a terrible connection and had the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.540
 sensitivity to the maximum to 10 then by 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.340
 that you see so many pulls with me not 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.500
 the same will happen my same game to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.570
 forgiveness is also recorded in the mode 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.020
 cinema that by the way is my first love 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.930
 with shotgun my first love tails peace and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.280
 I have a special love so I already 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.080
 you will see it within a minute that 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.210
 it remains of this mind nothing of the time but 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.160
 good as I was commenting on this 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.380
 series more or less I will bring maps 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.450
 that have very few visits that very 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.740
 few of you have seen it and that 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.560
 in my opinion 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.720
 Ruben forgiveness are websites that you can not 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.100
 lose so good I'll talk to you a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.290
 little bit about what 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 it's what goes through our heads like 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.530
 we also grew on youtube 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.140
 I'll say that in some other episode 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 how we discovered what he liked the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.520
 people or good things that I know 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.490
 happen I'll tell you in these series about 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.710
 the past about the things we did 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.510
 before the things that happen to us through 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.970
 head in this episode I'll tell you 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.280
 more or less what was our mentality 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.320
 every time we enter the play every time 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.410
 that we played modern warfare 3 that 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.540
 It was the only thing we played because 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.730
 at that time it was summer we were 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.620
 vacations and rubén and I had work 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.570
 so you could say that we 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.930
 we spent enough hours a day playing 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.900
 and our mentality was to enter the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.240
 play and get the fastest buap of the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.550
 world the fastest one possible if not 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.040
 we took out a water in three minutes 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.080
 not worth had to throw it away 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.210
 especially if it was with a weapon that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.090
 I was sitting or not but we wanted 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.310
 get out more super fast very chuli yes 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.950
 more to be possible as it happens and we are 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.930
 by the way here you see it a little green 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.550
 a little yellow because that day then 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.780
 I was with fever and good 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.460
 and they infect computer and a little 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.590
 yellow a little greenish 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.140
 but it's pretty much what we did was 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.540
 our mentality go into the play and 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.910
 raze to do everything possible to 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.940
 get us the fastest web in the world or 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.100
 the fastest website in Spain or break 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.770
 some record or just play 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.750
 aggressively for fun not and show 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.660
 of what we were capable of by that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.340
 time so good that's what 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.950
 we did every time we entered the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.410
 play then we also loved the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.930
 clips in modern warfare 3 we take out 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.360
 three no mounts that is the series of more 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.250
 success in the channel and they loved enchanted 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.680
 a series that from modern warfare 3 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.990
 until today in the black ops 2 is something that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.510
 has triumphed very much and here by the way 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.860
 You see he jumped out the window 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.930
 and I do not like the window because it's 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.730
 recorded the game in cinema mode as well 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.980
 that is the same they did it a lot 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.350
 is to go for super fast web and go for 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.630
 clips so the series started this is not 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.019
 a montage going for clicks to sack 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.169
 trying to get us out more 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.210
 and clips came out from time to time and good 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.710
 if you do not know what is that series 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.470
 that goes series because there's always 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.940
 new in the channel I will leave the beginning 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.069
 the first episode of the series in the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.650
 description in case you want to remember the 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.210
 old times with us in this fashion 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.729
 by the way I was when completely 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.009
 just meet the first youtuber that 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.720
 promotion or that stayed so 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.699
 impressed about what he says to me 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.180
 he said he wanted to promote me janet 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.740
 sour I do not know how to say it but good 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.990
 excuse me is watching this video 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.750
 of course but good is that all 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.030
 kids here you have the second website 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.820
 this series will treat as I said 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.680
 about talking or about what we did in 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.600
 the past that is what happened to us nothing 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.160
 by the head right now I do not know if it 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.930
 I would have liked the comment a lot 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.669
 because I'm a little thick 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.160
 but good kids here the fashion here the 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.750
 lay video has liked of course 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.169
 a lot of help goes out alone of course 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.169
 you say
