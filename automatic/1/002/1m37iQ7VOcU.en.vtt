everything<00:00:35.160> gets<00:00:35.340> wet<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.329> correctly<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
everything gets wet it out correctly and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
everything gets wet it out correctly and
then<00:00:37.110> draws<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.710> excess<00:00:37.920> resin<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
then draws out any excess resin so you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.590 
then draws out any excess resin so you
get<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> lighter<00:00:40.020> stronger<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.489> more<00:00:42.270> rigid

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
won't work I'd rather go out and tested

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
won't work I'd rather go out and tested
myself<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.329> feels<00:00:54.570> because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
myself see how it feels because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
myself see how it feels because
sometimes<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.289> find<00:00:55.500> one

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
sometimes you can find one

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
sometimes you can find one
characteristic<00:00:56.309> might<00:00:56.850> work<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
characteristic might work and then that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.000 
characteristic might work and then that
one<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:57.989> you're<00:00:58.109> taking<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.620> something

further<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> front<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.299> will<00:01:18.299> fit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
further the front any of them will fit

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
further the front any of them will fit
on<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> jet<00:01:19.049> ski<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:19.950> social

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

surfboard<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.950> able<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.250> spin

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
surfboard and then to be able to spin

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
surfboard and then to be able to spin
around<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> massive<00:01:45.600> freestyle<00:01:46.470> talk

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
around and do a massive freestyle talk

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.010 
around and do a massive freestyle talk
to<00:01:46.860> trick<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.820> know

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
to trick you know

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.539 
to trick you know
where<00:01:48.170> you're<00:01:48.380> doing<00:01:48.530> super<00:01:48.829> flips<00:01:49.100> or<00:01:49.340> saying

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
where you're doing super flips or saying

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.039 
where you're doing super flips or saying
like<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:49.789> land<00:01:50.299> back<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.689> wave<00:01:50.840> and

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
like that land back on the wave and

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.620 
like that land back on the wave and
right<00:01:51.229> away<00:01:51.469> is<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.579> my<00:01:52.880> biggest<00:01:53.149> goal<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.539> I

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
right away is is my biggest goal and I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.940 
right away is is my biggest goal and I
think<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.899> definitely<00:01:53.990> saying<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.710> there

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
think it's definitely saying that there

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.860 
think it's definitely saying that there
can<00:01:55.039> be<00:01:55.070> achieved

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.020 

a<00:01:58.930> jet<00:01:59.590> ski<00:01:59.710> probably<00:02:00.250> buy<00:02:00.430> from<00:02:00.730> a<00:02:00.760> shop<00:02:01.000> like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
a jet ski probably buy from a shop like

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
horsepower whereas what we do and you

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.780 
horsepower whereas what we do and you
know<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:08.500> go<00:02:08.680> bigger<00:02:09.010> you<00:02:09.250> need<00:02:09.400> a<00:02:09.430> little<00:02:09.700> bit

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
know to go bigger you need a little bit

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.700 
know to go bigger you need a little bit
more<00:02:09.910> horsepower<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:10.720> you're<00:02:11.350> looking<00:02:11.470> at

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
more horsepower so you're looking at

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.090 
more horsepower so you're looking at
about<00:02:12.000> 120<00:02:13.000> mark<00:02:13.210> I've<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:13.710> imported<00:02:14.710> for

about 120 mark I've just imported for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.590 
about 120 mark I've just imported for
the<00:02:15.220> biggest<00:02:15.520> motor<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.880> can<00:02:15.940> get<00:02:16.210> which<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the biggest motor you can get which is a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.860 
the biggest motor you can get which is a
billet<00:02:17.280> bottom<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.460> billet<00:02:18.970> cases<00:02:19.420> billy

farrell dasa power valve engine it's a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.310 
farrell dasa power valve engine it's a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
twin cylinder 1200 cc motor so I think

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.530 
twin cylinder 1200 cc motor so I think
it's<00:02:26.530> running<00:02:26.890> about<00:02:27.130> an<00:02:27.280> 86<00:02:27.790> mill<00:02:28.210> stroke

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
it's running about an 86 mill stroke

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.050 
it's running about an 86 mill stroke
with<00:02:28.720> 89<00:02:29.080> mill<00:02:29.260> Pistons<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.940> probably<00:02:30.940> puts

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
with 89 mill Pistons that probably puts

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.910 
with 89 mill Pistons that probably puts
out<00:02:31.270> about<00:02:31.300> 240<00:02:32.020> horsepower<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.650> scale

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
out about 240 horsepower and a scale

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.680 
out about 240 horsepower and a scale
that<00:02:32.950> weighs<00:02:33.190> 70<00:02:33.730> kilos<00:02:36.090> well<00:02:37.090> then<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.450> go<00:02:37.630> to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
that weighs 70 kilos well then I go to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.320 
that weighs 70 kilos well then I go to
the<00:02:37.870> gym<00:02:37.900> as<00:02:38.440> much<00:02:38.680> as<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.790> generally

four times a week you know I surf as

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.580 
four times a week you know I surf as
much<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.260> do<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> lot<00:02:47.530> of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
much as I can and then we do a lot of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.230 
much as I can and then we do a lot of
free<00:02:47.800> diving<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.430> things<00:02:48.640> like<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:49.000> try<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
free diving and things like to try and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.600 
free diving and things like to try and
stay<00:02:49.420> fit<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.780> keep<00:02:50.560> our<00:02:50.680> lung<00:02:50.830> capacities<00:02:51.430> up

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
stay fit and keep our lung capacities up

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.400 
stay fit and keep our lung capacities up
because<00:02:52.120> definitely<00:02:52.600> fun<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.290> helps

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
because definitely fun that that helps

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.040 
because definitely fun that that helps

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.160 

I<00:03:01.280> think<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.370> ultimate<00:03:02.790> goal<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.810> train<00:03:04.050> up

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
I think my ultimate goal is to train up

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.570 
I think my ultimate goal is to train up
and<00:03:04.350> write<00:03:04.470> some<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.070> big<00:03:05.370> waves

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
and write some really really big waves

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.100 
and write some really really big waves
on<00:03:05.790> these<00:03:05.970> because<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.810> horsepower

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
on these because we have the horsepower

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
on these because we have the horsepower
and<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.710> maneuverability<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.610> think<00:03:09.270> you

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
and the maneuverability I think you

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.990 
and the maneuverability I think you
could<00:03:09.570> pull<00:03:09.900> into<00:03:10.050> some<00:03:10.320> huge<00:03:11.130> surf<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.760> was<00:03:11.880> on

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
could pull into some huge surf I was on

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.390 
could pull into some huge surf I was on
40-foot<00:03:12.540> waves<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.620> try<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.070> do<00:03:14.190> some

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
40-foot waves you know try and do some

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.460 
40-foot waves you know try and do some
surfing<00:03:14.610> maneuvers<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.330> there<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.110> think

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
surfing maneuvers on there and I think

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.750 
surfing maneuvers on there and I think
that's<00:03:16.590> definitely<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.100> ultimate<00:03:17.190> goal<00:03:17.640> you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that's definitely the ultimate goal you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.190 
that's definitely the ultimate goal you
know<00:03:17.820> doing<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.300> aerial<00:03:18.540> tricks<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.050> stuff

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
know doing the aerial tricks and stuff

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.680 
know doing the aerial tricks and stuff
is<00:03:19.350> fun<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.860> writing<00:03:20.520> really<00:03:20.910> big<00:03:21.150> waves<00:03:21.390> is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
is fun but writing really big waves is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.390 
is fun but writing really big waves is
just<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.110> massive<00:03:22.380> rush<00:03:28.070> you're<00:03:29.070> only<00:03:29.160> limited

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
just a massive rush you're only limited

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.510 
just a massive rush you're only limited
by<00:03:29.640> your<00:03:29.790> imagination<00:03:30.230> there's<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.590> much<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
by your imagination there's so much that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.060 
by your imagination there's so much that
you<00:03:32.610> could<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.480> possible<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.950> know

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
you could do that's possible you know

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.870 
you could do that's possible you know
and<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.550> one<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> biggest

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
and I think one of the biggest
