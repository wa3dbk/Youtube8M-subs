00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.980 

hello<00:00:01.170> everybody<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:02.540> we<00:00:03.540> will<00:00:03.750> make<00:00:03.959> a

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hello everybody today we will make a

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.390 
hello everybody today we will make a
game<00:00:04.380> named<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.670> thinking<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.509> number<00:00:07.400> so

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
game named I'm thinking of a number so

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.220 
game named I'm thinking of a number so
let's<00:00:09.300> open<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:09.719> results<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.440> sharp<00:00:12.200> make<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
let's open your results you sharp make a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:26.200 
let's open your results you sharp make a
new<00:00:13.620> project<00:00:16.760> gas<00:00:17.760> game<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> first<00:00:24.680> we<00:00:25.680> make

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
new project gas game so first we make

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
new project gas game so first we make
the<00:00:27.210> generator<00:00:28.849> random<00:00:30.109> generator<00:00:31.460> equals

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the generator random generator equals

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.770 
the generator random generator equals
new<00:00:32.850> random<00:00:36.440> make<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.280> generator<00:00:40.700> now<00:00:41.780> we

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
new random make the generator now we

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
new random make the generator now we
need<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.170> make<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.930> number<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.649> thinking

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
need to make the number we are thinking

00:00:47.160 --> 00:01:00.910 
need to make the number we are thinking
of<00:00:48.590> in<00:00:49.590> number<00:00:50.309> equals<00:00:52.250> generator<00:00:53.270> next<00:00:55.910> 0<00:00:56.989> 101

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.500 

now<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.799> rewrite<00:01:05.780> I'm<00:01:07.460> thinking<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
now we will rewrite I'm thinking of a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:22.590 
now we will rewrite I'm thinking of a
number<00:01:10.040> from<00:01:11.040> 1<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:14.390> 100

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.819 

we<00:01:23.600> will<00:01:23.810> ask<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.640> gas<00:01:25.939> from<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.450> user<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
we will ask the gas from the user with a

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:38.010 
we will ask the gas from the user with a
for<00:01:28.280> loop<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:30.939> right<00:01:31.939> for<00:01:33.280> int<00:01:35.049> gas<00:01:36.399> because

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
for loop so right for int gas because

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.870 
for loop so right for int gas because
convert<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:40.189> integer<00:01:41.770> cancel<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:43.069> red

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
convert that to integer cancel that red

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:54.190 
convert that to integer cancel that red
line<00:01:47.289> if<00:01:48.399> our<00:01:49.399> gas<00:01:50.560> does<00:01:51.560> not<00:01:51.830> equals<00:01:52.399> R<00:01:53.330> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
line if our gas does not equals R the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.330 
line if our gas does not equals R the
number<00:01:56.709> then<00:01:57.709> gas<00:01:59.500> because<00:02:00.849> convert<00:02:01.849> that<00:02:02.270> to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
number then gas because convert that to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:17.500 
number then gas because convert that to
integer<00:02:04.869> cancer<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.140> red<00:02:06.560> line<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:17.450> will

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
integer cancer that red line so it will

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:29.440 
integer cancer that red line so it will
loop<00:02:18.459> until<00:02:19.459> our<00:02:20.829> gas<00:02:22.690> does<00:02:23.690> not<00:02:24.170> equals<00:02:28.450> the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
loop until our gas does not equals the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:40.420 
loop until our gas does not equals the
number<00:02:32.350> now<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:35.170> our<00:02:36.170> gas<00:02:37.989> less<00:02:38.989> than<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
number now if our gas less than the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.900 
number now if our gas less than the
number<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:45.410> write

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.490 

bigger<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.930> our<00:02:53.640> gas<00:02:54.930> bigger<00:02:55.930> than<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
bigger and if our gas bigger than the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.059 
bigger and if our gas bigger than the
number<00:02:58.379> answer<00:02:59.379> that<00:02:59.890> right<00:03:00.340> line

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
number answer that right line

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:10.199 
number answer that right line
lesser<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:08.440> loop<00:03:08.620> will<00:03:08.920> end<00:03:09.099> if<00:03:09.670> our<00:03:10.000> gas

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
lesser so the loop will end if our gas

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:20.910 
lesser so the loop will end if our gas
is<00:03:10.450> correct<00:03:13.470> also<00:03:14.580> dot<00:03:15.870> write<00:03:16.870> line<00:03:19.920> you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
is correct also dot write line you

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:37.979 
is correct also dot write line you
guessed<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.989> rate<00:03:26.200> K

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.199 

the<00:03:38.989> guess<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.260> correct<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:43.519> let's<00:03:43.549> try<00:03:43.999> it

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
the guess is correct so let's try it

00:03:44.209 --> 00:04:02.580 
the guess is correct so let's try it
oh<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:59.180> guessed<00:03:59.659> it

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.729 

so<00:04:03.590> thank<00:04:04.159> you<00:04:04.310> for<00:04:04.549> watching<00:04:04.999> I<00:04:05.239> hope<00:04:06.230> it

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
so thank you for watching I hope it

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.340 
so thank you for watching I hope it
helped<00:04:09.340> goodbye
