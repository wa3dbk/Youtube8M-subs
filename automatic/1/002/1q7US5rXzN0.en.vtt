00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:12.200
 and design 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.050
 well well different but very different 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.849
 and souffle as they are years and souffle 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 where do they come from, what is the origin of the child? 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.740
 who suffers good you ever 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 they were the bakery and they bought that dough 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:41.489
 You've never bought thin dough 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.460
 never again are there some that are the little bombs 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.320
 stuffed with good cream the base mass of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.809
 this year x is that mass bomb 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.210
 that same mass bomb here we have a loan 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.989
 attention to the amount of cee we have 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.300
 250 cubic centimeters of milk 125 of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.210
 butter a lot of maxi has to be 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 exact if we do not know what is the idea of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.489
 this dissolve in the warm milk the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 butter and here I have a little salt a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.370
 little pepper 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.230
 and ask leg if you can scratch me nut 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.500
 but it is very close to 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.500
 this kitchen 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.300
 but for a while I give you my sleeve in a while 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.890
 I give you the mark apart from the fly I would give 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.050
 a taste you see that is very particular 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
 if there are lovers and detractors 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.040
 as in life but the same is 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.510
 interesting to put a little nut 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.550
 moscada the last thing that we are going to put 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.570
 this listens well the same amount of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.990
 butter 125 of flour 4 zeros of a single 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 blow no longer doubt there is a single blow 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.550
 so listen to what I tell you we stir and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.260
 If this is rich, but it's bad 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.880
 the head is like this is good but if I'm 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.530
 evil of the head just like we do this 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.630
 It exists as a paste that although not 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:06.690
 it looks like it's going to unify everything you're not 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:09.030
 seeing everything has to be another silver 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.470
 are the gentlemen in my case change from 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.700
 ten pesos gave me five in the box 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.450
 that were not mine 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.060
 The three little ones tie a knot and 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.060
 you keep it and you put it under the plate 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.720
 and then supposedly you do not lack 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.480
 until you renew it before 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.930
 and notice that while we're missing duck 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.579
 I was commenting on this it seems like it seems like 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.040
 a medium thick puree I change it a bowl 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:08.090
 until it was understood to be but is 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.580
 really hard good not so much 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.069
 I break eggs in your house with more 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.560
 tranquility and one you are joining here 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.810
 there are going to be four eggs this I'm 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.810
 doing remember is called mass pump 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.250
 with wire whisk to the whisk 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.660
 hand steel I did it today while 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.980
 you chatted because I was 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.950
 interesting the subject and I did not want to do 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.750
 noise I put a hand beater that has 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.129
 the pÃ³sitos exactly now I'm going to 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.240
 show how I stay that passion 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:43.390
 violent in the subject 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.390
 I did not have violent jobs more violent 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.980
 the chefs are very characters 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.550
 individuals we know very well the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.550
 knives 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.300
 good 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.980
 look how is this you're seeing 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.470
 just as it falls it was understood this is a 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.200
 pump mass of this base then you're going to 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.000
 put in a sleeve it was understood is very 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.940
 difficult so far a little complicated 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.320
 tell me the band is in kitchen like 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.130
 dot com.ar where are all the 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.810
 recipes 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.030
 Here I have drinking and what I do is 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.620
 spit you spit you see short short 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.550
 short short short all number 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.550
 think about it 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.200
 good voice pressed the sleeve and to 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.200
 I was doing 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.670
 very well 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.810
 in boxes come envelopes are much more 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.550
 practical occupies mine places in the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.319
 performance forever so you keep 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.389
 enjoying all the flavor of the desserts 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.919
 richer and talking about rich desserts 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.289
 try the three new flavors of 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.569
 gelatinas manjar in light peach 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.550
 orange and red berries or new royal in 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.439
 about the same performance much more 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.590
 practical goes into royal moments 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.310
 puntocom royal feeds them joy 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.310
 what a pair 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:25.639
 and I want to tell you is that this once 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.009
 that you raise you count without expenses and already 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.960
 they are ready as we are going to accompany them 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.729
 here I have white sauce that applies 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.250
 often by doubt this shot the 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.569
 olive protection is worth remembering that 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.569
 I need someone to sing it 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.610
 1 liter of milk 80 flour 80 butter 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.039
 never forget because the white sauce 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.259
 always saves you and here a liter of milk 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.090
 80 of flour and 80 hold to make 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.789
 a good white sauce with white sauce 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.410
 to make it a little bit to run 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.210
 more because this is going to go to the oven I'm going 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.009
 to put milk cream if there is a 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.009
 diet topic I tell you one thing changes 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.240
 what the girls did here 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.409
 we agree that it seems a little to 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.409
 the production a bit 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:19.519
 and you in your house are going to continue 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.689
 well let's assume that it is full and 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:22.519
 what we are going to do we are going to put 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.139
 over all this white sauce mixture 

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:31.309
 and creams you understand in the second and I already 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.049
 we put grated cheese and this goes back to 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:37.899
 growing in the oven is understood when 

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:37.899
 gratina makes soufflÃ© grows that's why 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.629
 point 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:58.119
 Now I would like you to try them because 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.119
 It's so good 

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:14.289
