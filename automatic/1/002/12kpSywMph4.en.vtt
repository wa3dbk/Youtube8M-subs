this<00:02:13.730> rule<00:02:13.910> applies<00:02:14.209> above<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.599> transition

this rule applies above the transition

this rule applies above the transition

five<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> if<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.470> were<00:02:18.560> heading<00:02:18.860> say<00:02:19.489> one

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
five so if you were heading say one

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.699 
five so if you were heading say one
three<00:02:20.060> zero<00:02:20.090> like<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.380> should<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.590> a

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
three zero like this you should have a

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.100 
three zero like this you should have a
nod<00:02:21.980> plus<00:02:22.310> 500<00:02:22.819> altitude<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.750> would<00:02:23.959> give<00:02:24.080> us

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
nod plus 500 altitude this would give us

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
nod plus 500 altitude this would give us
options<00:02:24.410> such<00:02:24.800> as<00:02:24.830> three<00:02:25.190> thousand<00:02:25.580> five

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
options such as three thousand five

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.150 
options such as three thousand five
hundred<00:02:25.940> five<00:02:26.480> thousand<00:02:26.930> five<00:02:26.989> hundred<00:02:27.200> seven

hundred five thousand five hundred seven
thousand<00:02:28.520> five<00:02:28.670> hundred<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.300> on<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:29.870> we

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
thousand five hundred and so on if we

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.540 
thousand five hundred and so on if we
were<00:02:30.410> heading<00:02:30.709> in<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.860> opposite<00:02:31.220> direction

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
were heading in the opposite direction

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.220 
were heading in the opposite direction
we<00:02:31.760> would<00:02:31.910> need<00:02:32.000> an<00:02:32.150> even<00:02:32.390> plus<00:02:32.690> five<00:02:32.930> hundred

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
we would need an even plus five hundred

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.259 
we would need an even plus five hundred
altitude<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.400> could<00:02:34.550> use<00:02:34.670> values<00:02:35.060> such<00:02:35.239> as

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
altitude so we could use values such as

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.180 
altitude so we could use values such as
six<00:02:35.630> thousand<00:02:35.989> five<00:02:36.140> hundred<00:02:36.290> eighteen

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
six thousand five hundred eighteen

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.220 
six thousand five hundred eighteen
thousand<00:02:37.610> five<00:02:37.730> hundred<00:02:37.940> twenty<00:02:38.569> thousand

thousand five hundred twenty thousand

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.470 
thousand five hundred twenty thousand
five<00:02:39.380> hundred<00:02:39.590> etc<00:02:40.250> that's<00:02:41.090> some<00:02:41.330> basic

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
five hundred etc that's some basic

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.380 
five hundred etc that's some basic
ultimate<00:02:41.989> re4<00:02:42.290> you
