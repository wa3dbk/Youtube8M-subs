USB 3 is recommended for maximum speed

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
USB 3 is recommended for maximum speed
and<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.520> best<00:01:59.759> thing<00:01:59.969> about

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and I think really the best thing about

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
and I think really the best thing about
it<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> fact<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.170> use<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.469> over

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
it is the fact that you can use it over

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.880 
it is the fact that you can use it over
and<00:02:02.189> over<00:02:02.759> again<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.630> great<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.229> keep<00:02:04.619> one

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and over again so it's great to keep one

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.819 
and over again so it's great to keep one
