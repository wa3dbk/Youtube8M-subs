very poorly and we had to take him to

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.500 
very poorly and we had to take him to
the<00:00:37.780> vets<00:00:38.080> and<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:39.220> had<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.790> make<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:40.180> really

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
the vets and I had to make a really

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.750 
the vets and I had to make a really
awful<00:00:40.720> decision<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:42.010> get<00:00:42.160> him<00:00:42.280> put<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.610> sleep

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
awful decision to get him put to sleep

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.380 
awful decision to get him put to sleep
and<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.900> was<00:00:44.080> a<00:00:44.110> really<00:00:44.500> hard<00:00:44.740> choice<00:00:45.520> to<00:00:45.580> make

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
and it was a really hard choice to make

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.990 
and it was a really hard choice to make
but<00:00:46.630> I<00:00:46.660> knew<00:00:46.990> it<00:00:47.050> was<00:00:47.140> best<00:00:47.320> for<00:00:47.470> him<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.070> he's

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
but I knew it was best for him and he's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.060 
but I knew it was best for him and he's
no<00:00:49.210> longer<00:00:49.390> in<00:00:49.690> pain<00:00:49.930> which<00:00:50.230> was<00:00:50.440> really<00:00:50.800> good

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
no longer in pain which was really good

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
no longer in pain which was really good
and<00:00:51.400> I<00:00:51.820> am<00:00:52.120> really<00:00:52.960> like<00:00:53.500> missing<00:00:53.980> him<00:00:54.220> but

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and I am really like missing him but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.780 
and I am really like missing him but
that's<00:00:55.960> what<00:00:56.470> happens<00:00:56.890> when<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.370> were<00:00:57.460> pets

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790

guinea-pig spot for adoption and it

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.429 
guinea-pig spot for adoption and it
basically<00:01:09.789> just<00:01:09.939> said<00:01:10.329> that<00:01:11.020> these<00:01:11.229> two

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
of her pets at home which i think is

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.020 
of her pets at home which i think is
awful

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
awful

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.569 
awful
I<00:01:16.060> don't<00:01:16.479> know<00:01:16.630> why<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.380> dump<00:01:18.250> them<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.549> a

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
I don't know why you just dump them in a

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.130 
I don't know why you just dump them in a
box<00:01:18.850> outside<00:01:19.329> that's<00:01:19.479> her<00:01:19.719> and<00:01:19.869> I<00:01:19.929> think

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
box outside that's her and I think

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.560 
box outside that's her and I think
that's<00:01:20.350> like<00:01:20.439> awful<00:01:21.159> but<00:01:21.399> that's<00:01:22.359> what

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
that's like awful but that's what

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.749 
that's like awful but that's what
happened<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.380> there<00:01:24.070> were<00:01:24.219> in<00:01:24.429> quite<00:01:24.700> good

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
happened and there were in quite good

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.450 
happened and there were in quite good
condition<00:01:24.969> and<00:01:26.009> considering<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.039> they<00:01:27.369> have

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
condition and considering that they have

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.090 
condition and considering that they have
been<00:01:27.640> dumped<00:01:28.090> because<00:01:28.450> they<00:01:29.380> weren't<00:01:29.859> like

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
been dumped because they weren't like

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.130 
been dumped because they weren't like
dirty<00:01:30.460> or<00:01:30.759> anything<00:01:30.850> they<00:01:31.539> did<00:01:31.719> look<00:01:31.869> quite

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
dirty or anything they did look quite

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.940 
dirty or anything they did look quite
healthy<00:01:32.409> but<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:34.030> saw<00:01:34.479> this<00:01:34.630> poster<00:01:35.289> and<00:01:35.619> then

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
healthy but we saw this poster and then

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.910 
healthy but we saw this poster and then
we<00:01:36.789> were<00:01:36.880> just<00:01:36.909> thinking<00:01:37.299> maybe<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.710> would<00:01:38.740> be

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
we were just thinking maybe it would be

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.959 
we were just thinking maybe it would be
right<00:01:39.189> to<00:01:39.789> take<00:01:40.390> these<00:01:40.689> guys<00:01:40.899> on<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:42.850> them

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
right to take these guys on and put them

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.300 
right to take these guys on and put them
in<00:01:43.090> our<00:01:43.210> head<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.560> know<00:01:44.679> what<00:01:44.920> any<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.159> you

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
in our head and I know what any of you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.730 
in our head and I know what any of you
guys<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.549> think<00:01:45.999> that<00:01:46.689> this<00:01:47.259> would<00:01:47.590> be<00:01:47.619> like

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
guys to think that this would be like

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.770 
guys to think that this would be like
replacing<00:01:48.579> roller<00:01:48.819> because

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
replacing roller because

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.289 
replacing roller because
it's<00:01:49.900> not<00:01:49.990> either<00:01:50.170> after<00:01:50.320> all<00:01:50.619> for<00:01:51.130> heard<00:01:51.430> for

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
it's not either after all for heard for

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.539 
it's not either after all for heard for
obviously<00:01:52.930> not<00:01:53.470> very<00:01:53.500> happy<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.369> they<00:01:54.490> were

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
obviously not very happy and they were

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.789 
obviously not very happy and they were
quite<00:01:54.850> disturbed<00:01:55.060> because<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.900> what<00:01:56.409> happened

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
quite disturbed because of what happened

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.370 
quite disturbed because of what happened
in<00:01:56.950> Brownlow<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.909> we<00:01:58.420> thought<00:01:58.690> whilst<00:01:59.170> they

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
in Brownlow and we thought whilst they
