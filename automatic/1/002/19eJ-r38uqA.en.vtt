00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
outside that it says Ford this is pretty

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.160

cool<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:20.180> special<00:01:21.180> exhaust<00:01:21.509> pipes<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cool it's got special exhaust pipes that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.330 
cool it's got special exhaust pipes that
are<00:01:22.320> apparently<00:01:23.040> mufflers<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:25.340> supposedly

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
are apparently mufflers that supposedly

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.109 
are apparently mufflers that supposedly
make<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.670> sound<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> 1968<00:01:29.610> movie

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
make it sound like the the 1968 movie

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
make it sound like the the 1968 movie
was<00:01:30.299> Steve<00:01:31.079> McQueen<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.280> he<00:01:32.340> was

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
was Steve McQueen and when he was

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.499 
was Steve McQueen and when he was
chasing<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.380> charger<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.390> don't<00:01:36.390> think

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
chasing the charger but I don't think

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.630 
chasing the charger but I don't think
they<00:01:36.689> sound<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
they sound very much like it and the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.039 
they sound very much like it and the
reason<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.060> doing<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.900> because

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
reason I'm doing all this is because

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.240 
reason I'm doing all this is because
tomorrow<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.000> install<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.740> Corsa

tomorrow I'm going to install the Corsa
exhaust<00:01:44.850> system<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.710> car<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> wanted

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
exhaust system on this car and I wanted

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.490 
exhaust system on this car and I wanted
to<00:01:47.930> register<00:01:50.090> what<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> sounded<00:01:51.659> like

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to register what it sounded like

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.370 
to register what it sounded like
at<00:01:53.009> least<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.049> viewpoint<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.259> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
at least from the viewpoint that you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.080 
at least from the viewpoint that you
just<00:01:55.590> saw<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:58.280> show<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.729> sounded

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
just saw and show you what it sounded

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
just saw and show you what it sounded
like<00:02:00.149> from<00:02:00.509> outside<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.229> tomorrow<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
like from outside and then tomorrow I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.090 
like from outside and then tomorrow I
will<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> same<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> courses

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
