the fear and do it anyway am I promising
that<00:02:21.580> everything's<00:02:21.970> gonna<00:02:22.090> work<00:02:22.180> out<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.660> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that everything's gonna work out if you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.990 
that everything's gonna work out if you
do<00:02:22.900> he'll<00:02:23.349> know<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:23.980> might<00:02:24.370> crash<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.849> burn

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.580 
do he'll know you might crash and burn
next<00:02:25.480> time<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.720> might<00:02:25.870> fall<00:02:26.110> out<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.410> building

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
next time I might fall out the building

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.770 
next time I might fall out the building
but<00:02:26.890> either<00:02:27.040> you'll<00:02:27.310> succeed<00:02:27.580> or<00:02:28.090> you'll<00:02:28.540> gain

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
but either you'll succeed or you'll gain

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.080 
but either you'll succeed or you'll gain
some<00:02:29.230> knowledge<00:02:29.440> or<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> lesson<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
some knowledge or a lesson of what you

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.839 
some knowledge or a lesson of what you
should<00:02:31.150> be<00:02:31.390> doing<00:02:31.420> next<00:02:31.900> we<00:02:32.290> either<00:02:32.470> win<00:02:32.860> or<00:02:33.190> we

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
should be doing next we either win or we

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.339 
should be doing next we either win or we
learn<00:02:34.060> but<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> guess<00:02:34.629> if<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> fall<00:02:35.049> off<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
learn but I guess if a fall off the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.259 
learn but I guess if a fall off the
building<00:02:35.530> I'll<00:02:35.830> probably<00:02:36.010> die<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.879> much<00:02:37.090> to

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
building I'll probably die not much to

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.670 
building I'll probably die not much to
learn<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.959> should<00:02:38.170> definitely

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
learn from that I should definitely

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800 
learn from that I should definitely
reevaluate<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.370> choices<00:02:39.730> worrying<00:02:40.720> about

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
reevaluate my choices worrying about

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.809 
reevaluate my choices worrying about
what<00:02:41.110> could<00:02:41.319> go<00:02:41.349> wrong<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.920> completely<00:02:42.670> know

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
what could go wrong is completely know

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.850 
what could go wrong is completely know
all<00:02:43.120> our<00:02:43.180> lives<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.870> shown<00:02:44.110> us<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.440> most<00:02:44.709> of

the things that we worry about rarely

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.750

ever<00:02:47.110> happen<00:02:47.709> there's<00:02:48.010> another<00:02:48.250> quote<00:02:48.549> that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
ever happen there's another quote that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.550 
ever happen there's another quote that
says<00:02:48.940> worrying<00:02:49.569> is<00:02:49.720> like<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.959> rocking<00:02:50.260> chair

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
