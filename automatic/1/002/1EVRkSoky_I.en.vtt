to<00:00:20.529> I<00:00:20.949> want<00:00:21.189> to<00:00:21.250> put<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:21.400> secondary<00:00:21.850> fuel<00:00:22.090> module

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
to I want to put a secondary fuel module

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.370 
to I want to put a secondary fuel module
on<00:00:22.869> it<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:24.519> that<00:00:24.849> that<00:00:25.179> that<00:00:25.509> unit<00:00:25.990> will

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
on it and that that that unit will

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.589 
on it and that that that unit will
control<00:00:27.159> the<00:00:27.339> upper<00:00:27.429> injector<00:00:27.999> so<00:00:28.269> we<00:00:28.419> can

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
control the upper injector so we can

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.109 
control the upper injector so we can
modify<00:00:29.109> the<00:00:29.230> fuel<00:00:29.470> not<00:00:30.460> only<00:00:30.789> with<00:00:30.909> a<00:00:30.970> lower

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
modify the fuel not only with a lower

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.580 
modify the fuel not only with a lower
injection<00:00:31.449> but<00:00:31.570> also<00:00:31.689> in<00:00:31.839> the<00:00:31.929> upper<00:00:32.169> injector

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
injection but also in the upper injector

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.350 
injection but also in the upper injector
which<00:00:32.739> should<00:00:32.920> help<00:00:33.190> you<00:00:33.850> know<00:00:33.970> mid-range

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
has a custom artist zip death this one

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.490 
has a custom artist zip death this one
works<00:02:07.090> for<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> r1<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> r6<00:02:08.500> yeah<00:02:08.950> yeah<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
works for the r1 and the r6 yeah yeah it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
works for the r1 and the r6 yeah yeah it
works<00:02:11.680> good<00:02:12.010> too<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.549> don't<00:02:12.730> really<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.330> on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
works good too I don't really like it on

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.839 
works good too I don't really like it on
the<00:02:13.540> r6

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
the r6

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.970 
the r6
so<00:02:15.689> that's<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> key<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.469> is<00:02:16.590> needs<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.890> be

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so that's the key this is needs to be

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.559 
so that's the key this is needs to be
grounded<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.549> engine<00:02:17.969> and<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
grounded to the engine and not to the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.970 
grounded to the engine and not to the
battery<00:02:21.049> it's<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.109> little<00:02:22.499> tricky<00:02:22.859> if<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
battery it's a little tricky if you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.440 
battery it's a little tricky if you
don't<00:02:23.129> take<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> tank<00:02:23.670> off<00:02:23.849> but<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.209> can<00:02:24.329> be

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
don't take the tank off but it can be

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.789 
don't take the tank off but it can be
done<00:02:24.599> yeah<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:24.989> probably<00:02:25.109> easier<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> take

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
done yeah it's probably easier to take

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.610 
done yeah it's probably easier to take
the<00:02:25.950> tank<00:02:26.159> off<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.840> saved<00:02:28.109> a<00:02:28.230> bit<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.469> time

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the tank off but we saved a bit of time

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.690 
the tank off but we saved a bit of time
by<00:02:28.799> leaving<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.219> on<00:02:29.310> bit<00:02:30.269> instability<00:02:30.870> gas

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
by leaving it on bit instability gas

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.250 
by leaving it on bit instability gas
just<00:02:32.700> take<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.030> lead<00:02:33.329> we'll<00:02:33.629> wrap<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.139> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
just take this lead we'll wrap it up and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.629 
just take this lead we'll wrap it up and
keep<00:02:34.439> it<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.680> against<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.010> side<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> frame

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
keep it up against the side of the frame

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:47.619 
keep it up against the side of the frame
here<00:02:36.560> plenty<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.620> clearance<00:02:37.889> there<00:02:45.169> the<00:02:46.169> tank

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
here plenty of clearance there the tank

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.699 
here plenty of clearance there the tank

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
tricks most guys is the software update

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.330 
tricks most guys is the software update
right<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.049> then<00:03:13.169> doing<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.560> programming<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
right and then doing the programming and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.770 
right and then doing the programming and
that's<00:03:14.519> usually<00:03:14.699> where<00:03:14.939> guys<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.299> frustrated

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
that's usually where guys get frustrated

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
now then close that out then we're gonna

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.550 
now then close that out then we're gonna
go<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.009> power<00:04:20.370> commander<00:04:20.759> tools<00:04:21.019> now<00:04:22.019> one<00:04:22.469> of

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
go to power commander tools now one of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.450 
go to power commander tools now one of
the<00:04:22.620> things<00:04:22.770> we've<00:04:22.919> been<00:04:22.949> doing<00:04:23.219> is<00:04:23.340> we've

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the things we've been doing is we've

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.399 
the things we've been doing is we've
been<00:04:23.760> running<00:04:24.000> an<00:04:24.180> auto<00:04:24.360> attend<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.260> had<00:04:25.380> a

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
been running an auto attend so we had a

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.010 
been running an auto attend so we had a
target<00:04:26.279> air<00:04:26.580> fuel<00:04:26.789> feature<00:04:27.330> that<00:04:27.599> was<00:04:27.719> set<00:04:27.900> in

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
target air fuel feature that was set in

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.560 
target air fuel feature that was set in
here<00:04:28.199> yeah

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
here yeah

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.110 
here yeah
and<00:04:28.690> then<00:04:29.020> we<00:04:29.200> had<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.620> basement<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.790> had<00:04:31.000> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
and then we had the basement and had the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.200 
and then we had the basement and had the
trim<00:04:31.360> mat<00:04:31.540> so<00:04:32.530> we're<00:04:33.190> probably<00:04:33.370> pretty<00:04:33.820> happy

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
trim mat so we're probably pretty happy

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.670 
trim mat so we're probably pretty happy
with<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.450> trim<00:04:34.660> mat<00:04:34.870> but<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:35.470> we're<00:04:35.590> just

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
with the trim mat but I think we're just

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.110 
with the trim mat but I think we're just
gonna<00:04:35.770> go<00:04:35.980> in<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.220> zero<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.580> out<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.940> it'll

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
gonna go in and zero it out and it'll

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.440 
gonna go in and zero it out and it'll
start<00:04:37.420> correcting<00:04:38.320> over<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.740> base<00:04:38.920> map<00:04:39.450> where

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
start correcting over the base map where

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.140 
start correcting over the base map where
it<00:04:40.480> is<00:04:40.630> now<00:04:40.870> with<00:04:41.260> both<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:42.460> lower<00:04:42.640> injectors

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
it is now with both the lower injectors

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.390 
it is now with both the lower injectors
and<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.420> upper<00:04:43.720> injectors<00:04:44.200> evenly<00:04:44.740> yeah<00:04:45.100> that

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
and the upper injectors evenly yeah that

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.770 
and the upper injectors evenly yeah that
usually<00:04:45.700> works<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.240> best<00:04:47.250> key<00:04:48.250> switch<00:04:48.490> on<00:04:48.780> yes

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
usually works the best key switch on yes

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.080 
usually works the best key switch on yes
okay<00:04:50.190> we're<00:04:51.190> all<00:04:51.310> good<00:04:51.340> we're<00:04:51.670> plugged<00:04:51.910> in

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
okay we're all good we're plugged in

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:01.600 
okay we're all good we're plugged in
here

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.570 

all<00:05:02.180> right<00:05:02.419> well<00:05:02.659> that's<00:05:03.139> it<00:05:03.349> so<00:05:03.650> now<00:05:03.919> now<00:05:04.460> what

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
all right well that's it so now now what

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.439 
all right well that's it so now now what
you're<00:05:04.699> going<00:05:04.789> to<00:05:04.849> do<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.120> can<00:05:05.150> take<00:05:05.360> it

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
you're going to do is you can take it

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.779 
you're going to do is you can take it
out<00:05:05.539> riding<00:05:05.900> around<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:07.250> then<00:05:07.370> when<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.580> come

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
out riding around and then when you come

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.020 
out riding around and then when you come
in<00:05:08.030> we'll<00:05:08.810> save<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.530> auto<00:05:10.189> Corrections<00:05:10.939> that

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
in we'll save the auto Corrections that

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.540 
in we'll save the auto Corrections that
it<00:05:11.210> makes<00:05:11.449> and<00:05:12.319> then<00:05:12.439> it'll<00:05:12.680> define<00:05:13.069> as<00:05:13.310> that

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
it makes and then it'll define as that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.100 
it makes and then it'll define as that
as<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.879> day<00:05:14.000> goes<00:05:14.150> on<00:05:14.360> each<00:05:14.599> time<00:05:14.840> we<00:05:14.960> do<00:05:15.080> a

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
as the day goes on each time we do a

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.890 
as the day goes on each time we do a
save<00:05:15.469> we<00:05:16.219> update<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.580> it'll<00:05:17.120> be<00:05:17.240> it'll<00:05:17.719> run

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
save we update it it'll be it'll run

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.189 
save we update it it'll be it'll run
better<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.229> better<00:05:18.469> gotcha
