where<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.500> goes<00:02:07.590> across<00:02:08.179> both<00:02:09.179> pages

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
where it goes across both pages

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.540 
where it goes across both pages
but<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.120> not<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> splash<00:02:11.930> page<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:13.370> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
but it's not a splash page it's a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.060 
but it's not a splash page it's a
standard<00:02:13.940> page<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.870> mean<00:02:15.380> structure<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
standard page I mean structure like a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.490 
standard page I mean structure like a
standard<00:02:16.430> page<00:02:16.640> with<00:02:16.940> panels<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.540> whatnot<00:02:17.840> um

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.300 

which<00:02:24.400> sometimes<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:26.000> really<00:02:26.480> bad<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
which sometimes is really bad and in the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.120 
which sometimes is really bad and in the
80s<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.910> when<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.300> was<00:02:29.570> at<00:02:29.720> its<00:02:29.840> worst<00:02:30.130> because

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
80s is when it was at its worst because

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.320 
80s is when it was at its worst because
they<00:02:31.280> do<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.800> built<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.940> such

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
they do this and it's it's built in such

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.100 
they do this and it's it's built in such
a<00:02:35.360> way<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.500> almost<00:02:36.980> can't<00:02:37.580> tell<00:02:38.020> um<00:02:39.020> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
a way that you almost can't tell um I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.420 
a way that you almost can't tell um I

Neil run we're it's like a normal page

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.370 
Neil run we're it's like a normal page
and<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:02.030> when<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.420> when<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.959> look<00:03:03.200> at<00:03:03.350> it

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
and just when you when you look at it

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.620 
and just when you when you look at it
you<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.370> doesn't<00:03:04.610> immediately<00:03:05.030> occur<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
you it doesn't immediately occur to you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.710 
you it doesn't immediately occur to you
that<00:03:05.660> these<00:03:06.020> are<00:03:06.700> one<00:03:07.700> page<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.390> looks<00:03:08.510> like

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
that these are one page it looks like

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.120 
that these are one page it looks like
it's<00:03:08.900> two<00:03:09.170> pages<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.739> are<00:03:09.770> just<00:03:09.950> taking

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
it's two pages that are just taking

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.790 
it's two pages that are just taking
place<00:03:10.370> over<00:03:10.580> across<00:03:10.970> one<00:03:11.360> scene<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.050> I'm<00:03:12.530> sure

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
place over across one scene and I'm sure

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.290 
place over across one scene and I'm sure
it's<00:03:12.980> probably<00:03:13.250> not<00:03:13.430> helped<00:03:13.730> by<00:03:13.820> reading<00:03:14.209> it

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
it's probably not helped by reading it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.030 
it's probably not helped by reading it
and<00:03:14.390> trade<00:03:14.720> where<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.140> not<00:03:15.320> fully<00:03:15.769> spread

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
and trade where it's not fully spread

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.100 
and trade where it's not fully spread
out<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.340> have<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.610> kind<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:16.880> seem<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.870> lot

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
out you have that kind of seem but a lot

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.259 
out you have that kind of seem but a lot
of<00:03:18.140> times<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.739> doesn't<00:03:19.040> look<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:20.120> uh

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
of times it doesn't look like it's uh

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.550 
of times it doesn't look like it's uh
you<00:03:23.269> know<00:03:23.390> one<00:03:23.660> panel<00:03:24.110> going<00:03:24.320> all<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.500> way

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
you know one panel going all the way

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.080 
you know one panel going all the way
across<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.950> sometimes<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.580> will<00:03:25.790> be<00:03:25.940> what

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
across and sometimes that will be what

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.720 
across and sometimes that will be what
it<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.660> that's<00:03:26.870> annoying<00:03:27.280> when<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.459> like

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
it is and that's annoying when it's like

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.789 
it is and that's annoying when it's like
the<00:03:29.030> one<00:03:29.330> panel<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.900> goes<00:03:30.049> across<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.380> top

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
the one panel that goes across the top

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.640 
the one panel that goes across the top
and<00:03:31.130> then<00:03:31.970> everything<00:03:32.269> else<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.750> kind<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.200> more

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
and then everything else is kind of more

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.960 
and then everything else is kind of more
box<00:03:34.070> like<00:03:34.430> uh<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.530> really<00:03:36.890> looks<00:03:37.280> like<00:03:37.519> it's

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
box like uh so it really looks like it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.449 
box like uh so it really looks like it's
just<00:03:38.120> two<00:03:38.540> pages<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.140> happen<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.560> have<00:03:39.739> you

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
just two pages that happen to have you

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
just two pages that happen to have you
know<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.610> long<00:03:41.120> panel<00:03:41.690> at<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.810> top<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.410> you

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
know a long panel at the top and you

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.500 
know a long panel at the top and you
don't<00:03:42.739> realize<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.459> that's<00:03:43.610> supposed<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.299> be

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
don't realize that that's supposed to be

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.960 
don't realize that that's supposed to be
the<00:03:45.019> signal<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.560> hey<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.100> one<00:03:46.280> page<00:03:46.489> so

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
the signal that hey this is one page so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.580 
the signal that hey this is one page so
you'll<00:03:47.120> read<00:03:47.420> down<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.900> page<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.320> like<00:03:48.440> well

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
you'll read down the page and like well

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.470 
you'll read down the page and like well
that<00:03:48.620> didn't<00:03:49.010> make<00:03:49.100> any<00:03:49.160> sense<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.940> then

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
that didn't make any sense and then

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.050 
that didn't make any sense and then
you'll<00:03:50.600> realize<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:52.310> know<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:52.760> that

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
you'll realize you know it's like that

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.650 
you'll realize you know it's like that
um<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.019> don't<00:03:54.500> much<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.340> say<00:03:55.549> beyond<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.330> it's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
um I don't much to say beyond that it's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.759 
um I don't much to say beyond that it's
just<00:03:56.810> something<00:03:57.080> that<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.260> kind<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.500> wanted<00:03:57.680> to

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
just something that I kind of wanted to

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.500 
just something that I kind of wanted to
