00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.459 
carbohydrates so a lot of people ask me
Isabelle<00:00:11.280> are<00:00:11.580> carbohydrates<00:00:12.269> making<00:00:13.110> me<00:00:13.259> fat

Isabelle are carbohydrates making me fat

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.760 
Isabelle are carbohydrates making me fat
or<00:00:13.860> do<00:00:14.670> all<00:00:14.880> carbs<00:00:15.389> make<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.990> fat<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.740> answer

or do all carbs make you fat the answer
is<00:00:17.340> no<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:18.270> need<00:00:18.300> carbohydrates<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.830> make

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

carbohydrates now exactly what is a car

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.200 
carbohydrates now exactly what is a car
carbs<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.290> things<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.680> bread<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.910> pasta

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
carbs can be things like bread and pasta

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.619 
carbs can be things like bread and pasta
and<00:00:36.870> potatoes<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.860> they're<00:00:38.040> also<00:00:38.329> fruits<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and potatoes but they're also fruits and

and potatoes but they're also fruits and
vegetables<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.710> beans<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
vegetables and some beans and a lot of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
vegetables and some beans and a lot of
people<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.899> bread<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> pasta<00:00:43.739> when

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
people just think bread and pasta when

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
people just think bread and pasta when
they<00:00:44.309> think<00:00:44.550> carbs<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.719> fruits<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
they think carbs when really fruits and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.569 
they think carbs when really fruits and
vegetables<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.100> give<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
vegetables can give you the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.330 
vegetables can give you the
carbohydrates<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.629> need<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.050> well<00:00:49.340> so

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
carbohydrates that you need as well so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
carbohydrates that you need as well so
when<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.640> eat<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> carbohydrate<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:52.289> body

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body
takes<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> breaks<00:00:53.940> them<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
takes them and breaks them down and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.799 
takes them and breaks them down and
create<00:00:55.230> glucose<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.879> need<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> glucose

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
create glucose and you need that glucose

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.349 
create glucose and you need that glucose
in<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.320> blood<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:59.039> order<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.609> function<00:00:59.969> well

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
in your blood in order to function well

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.049 
in your blood in order to function well
it<00:01:01.079> also<00:01:01.379> takes<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:02.039> carbohydrates<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it also takes these carbohydrates and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
it also takes these carbohydrates and
stores<00:01:03.449> them<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.960> energy<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.250> liver

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
stores them in as energy in your liver

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
stores them in as energy in your liver
and<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.210> muscles<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> exercise

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and in your muscles so if you exercise

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
and in your muscles so if you exercise
you<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.000> need<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> eat<00:01:09.540> carbs<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you really do need to eat carbs the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
you really do need to eat carbs the
problem<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.420> people<00:01:12.780> are

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
problem is is that a lot of people are

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.800 
problem is is that a lot of people are
eating<00:01:13.170> an<00:01:13.500> overabundance<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.810> carbohydrates

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
eating an overabundance of carbohydrates

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
eating an overabundance of carbohydrates
especially<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> form<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> processed

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
especially in the form of processed

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
especially in the form of processed
foods<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.570> baked<00:01:18.960> goods<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.650> different

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
foods and baked goods and different

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
foods and baked goods and different
breads<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> pasta<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.229> that's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
breads and a lot of pasta and that's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
breads and a lot of pasta and that's
where<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.460> wrong<00:01:23.780> another<00:01:24.780> thing

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
where we're going wrong another thing

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
where we're going wrong another thing
that<00:01:25.140> happens<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.979> carbohydrates<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.180> they

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that happens with carbohydrates is they

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
that happens with carbohydrates is they
turn<00:01:27.750> into<00:01:27.960> glucose<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.310> body

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
turn into glucose and if your body

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
turn into glucose and if your body
doesn't<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.990> turns<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.500> into

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
doesn't use them then it turns them into

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.760 
doesn't use them then it turns them into
fat<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.270> stores<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.229> body<00:01:34.500> as

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
fat and it stores them in your body as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.600 
fat and it stores them in your body as
fat<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.360> okay<00:01:37.290> what<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
fat so okay what are you going to do you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.310 
fat so okay what are you going to do you
need<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> eat<00:01:39.150> carbs<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.630> energy<00:01:39.689> into

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
need to eat carbs for energy into

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800 
need to eat carbs for energy into
function<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> eat<00:01:42.540> too

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
function but you don't want to eat too

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.289 
function but you don't want to eat too
many<00:01:42.930> carbs<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.799> gain<00:01:44.100> weight<00:01:44.299> will

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
many carbs so that you gain weight will

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.810 
many carbs so that you gain weight will
follow<00:01:45.600> these<00:01:45.930> rules<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.700> have

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
follow these rules and you will have

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
follow these rules and you will have
enough<00:01:48.149> energy<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:48.840> carbohydrates

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
enough energy from your carbohydrates

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.300 
enough energy from your carbohydrates
without<00:01:50.070> gaining<00:01:50.340> weight<00:01:51.110> only<00:01:52.110> eat<00:01:52.320> starchy

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
without gaining weight only eat starchy

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.389 
without gaining weight only eat starchy
carbohydrates<00:01:54.270> after<00:01:54.930> activity<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> after

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
carbohydrates after activity and after

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.539
