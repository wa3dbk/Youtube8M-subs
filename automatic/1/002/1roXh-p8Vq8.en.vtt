off my hair in different sections in

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.080 
off my hair in different sections in
about<00:02:23.049> five<00:02:23.319> different<00:02:23.530> sections<00:02:24.100> around<00:02:24.489> so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160

bottle<00:02:36.010> with<00:02:36.549> water<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.480> case<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:38.320> dries

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
bottle with water just in case it dries

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.710 
bottle with water just in case it dries
out<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.280> little<00:02:39.549> bit<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:40.030> add<00:02:40.329> some<00:02:40.540> water

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
out a little bit I can add some water

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.569 
out a little bit I can add some water
back<00:02:40.989> into<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.440> because<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.920> key<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.489> is

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
back into it because the key to it is

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.580 
back into it because the key to it is
keeping<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:43.060> hair<00:02:43.239> as<00:02:43.359> wet<00:02:43.600> as<00:02:43.630> possible<00:02:44.380> when

pudding<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.980> will<00:02:48.220> take<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
pudding in it so that it will take the

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.670 
pudding in it so that it will take the
shape<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:48.940> your<00:02:49.000> natural<00:02:49.510> curls<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:50.530> gonna

bit and again when you put this thing

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.050 
bit and again when you put this thing
you<00:03:23.870> want<00:03:24.080> it<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.320> be<00:03:24.880> extremely<00:03:25.880> wet<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:28.060> I'm

you want it to be extremely wet so I'm

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.660 
you want it to be extremely wet so I'm

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.010 
going to just add a little bit more if
you're<00:03:31.880> wondering<00:03:32.240> why<00:03:32.420> I'm<00:03:32.600> doing<00:03:32.900> this

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.990 
you're wondering why I'm doing this
outside<00:03:34.030> one<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:36.250> guess<00:03:37.250> it's<00:03:37.430> better<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.790> drip

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
outside one I guess it's better to drip

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.490 
outside one I guess it's better to drip
all<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.300> stuff<00:03:38.540> outside<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.020> don't<00:03:39.230> normally

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500

do<00:03:39.830> this<00:03:39.980> outside<00:03:40.190> but<00:03:40.580> I'm<00:03:40.670> doing<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.090> outside

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
do this outside but I'm doing it outside

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.979 
do this outside but I'm doing it outside
for<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.650> purposes<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.400> video<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.420> you

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
for the purposes of this video so you

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.510 
for the purposes of this video so you
can<00:03:45.200> see<00:03:45.410> better<00:03:45.650> with<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.980> natural<00:03:46.370> light

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.600 
can see better with the natural light
I'm<00:03:47.390> using<00:03:47.660> about<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.290> much<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:49.430> thing

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
I'm using about that much the thing

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.190 
I'm using about that much the thing
about<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.630> don't<00:03:50.840> really<00:03:50.989> have

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
about this is that you don't really have

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.229 
about this is that you don't really have
to<00:03:51.350> worry<00:03:51.560> about<00:03:51.620> being<00:03:52.220> heavy-handed<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.090> it

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
to worry about being heavy-handed in it

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.850

but I don't really like to go out with
it<00:06:03.789> this<00:06:04.060> wet<00:06:04.419> so<00:06:04.779> I'll<00:06:05.020> sit<00:06:05.229> under<00:06:05.469> the<00:06:05.589> dryer

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620

it this wet so I'll sit under the dryer
for<00:06:06.099> a<00:06:06.129> little<00:06:06.370> bit<00:06:06.520> I've<00:06:06.699> noticed<00:06:07.300> that

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
for a little bit I've noticed that

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.100

sitting<00:06:08.199> under<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.560> dryer<00:06:08.589> with<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.279> on<00:06:09.460> cool

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
sitting under the dryer with it on cool

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.980 
sitting under the dryer with it on cool
reduces<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.529> shrinkage<00:06:12.039> and<00:06:12.279> the<00:06:12.819> frizz<00:06:13.150> so<00:06:13.690> I

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
reduces the shrinkage and the frizz so I

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.110 
reduces the shrinkage and the frizz so I
sit<00:06:14.229> under<00:06:14.469> the<00:06:14.589> dryer<00:06:14.620> with<00:06:15.069> it<00:06:15.219> on<00:06:15.339> cool<00:06:15.669> for

about 45 minutes to an hour my hair is
pretty<00:06:18.729> thick<00:06:19.089> so<00:06:19.659> it<00:06:19.839> takes<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.409> little<00:06:21.099> long

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
pretty thick so it takes a little long
