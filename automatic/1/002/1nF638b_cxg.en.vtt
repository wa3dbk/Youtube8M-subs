there right now

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.250 
there right now
but<00:03:21.609> it's<00:03:21.849> it's<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.209> useful<00:03:22.419> thing<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.109> use<00:03:23.230> a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
but it's it's a useful thing and I use a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.020 
but it's it's a useful thing and I use a
bungee<00:03:23.590> cord<00:03:23.709> just<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.250> Tommy<00:03:24.549> off<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.940> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
bungee cord just to Tommy off to the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.280 
bungee cord just to Tommy off to the
tree<00:03:25.269> but<00:03:25.450> really<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.750> could<00:03:25.959> have<00:03:26.049> stuck<00:03:26.260> that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
tree but really I could have stuck that

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.229 
tree but really I could have stuck that
in<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.620> ground<00:03:26.889> it<00:03:27.730> would<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:28.000> been<00:03:28.120> good

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
in the ground it would have been good

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.140 
in the ground it would have been good
enough<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.739> like<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.220> design<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.579> lot<00:03:30.849> it's

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
enough so I like this design a lot it's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.259 
enough so I like this design a lot it's
it's<00:03:31.810> handy<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.639> wanted<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.090> raise

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
all right I was thinking now how I'd

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.080 
all right I was thinking now how I'd
heat<00:06:22.770> this<00:06:22.949> up<00:06:23.190> at<00:06:23.370> night<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.699> here<00:06:23.850> you<00:06:23.910> get<00:06:24.030> a

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
heat this up at night and here you get a

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.200 
heat this up at night and here you get a
little<00:06:24.330> bit<00:06:24.449> of<00:06:24.539> heat<00:06:24.720> in<00:06:24.750> here<00:06:25.639> I<00:06:26.639> didn't

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
little bit of heat in here I didn't

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.090 
little bit of heat in here I didn't
close<00:06:27.389> up<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:27.840> entrance<00:06:28.229> but<00:06:28.470> what<00:06:28.590> I<00:06:28.620> did<00:06:28.889> do

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
close up the entrance but what I did do

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.490 
close up the entrance but what I did do
is<00:06:29.340> you<00:06:29.970> can<00:06:30.120> hang<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.419> candle<00:06:30.840> lantern<00:06:31.199> and<00:06:31.350> he

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
something like that long as he had

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.779 
something like that long as he had
enough<00:06:37.199> ventilation<00:06:37.440> to<00:06:38.039> keep<00:06:38.550> out<00:06:38.759> the

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
enough ventilation to keep out the

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.390 
enough ventilation to keep out the

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.480 
the the dry resin the pine set the dry
stuff<00:07:02.669> and<00:07:03.380> so<00:07:04.380> I<00:07:04.410> put<00:07:04.949> that<00:07:05.070> in<00:07:05.250> the<00:07:05.340> middle

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
stuff and so I put that in the middle

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.390 
stuff and so I put that in the middle
and<00:07:06.000> lit<00:07:06.690> it<00:07:06.780> on<00:07:06.900> fire<00:07:06.960> and<00:07:07.560> it's<00:07:07.800> burning<00:07:08.220> it's

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
and lit it on fire and it's burning it's

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.210 
and lit it on fire and it's burning it's
burning<00:07:08.460> for<00:07:08.910> about<00:07:09.120> 20<00:07:09.479> minutes<00:07:09.690> now<00:07:09.870> I<00:07:10.220> guess

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
burning for about 20 minutes now I guess

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.920 
burning for about 20 minutes now I guess
we're<00:07:11.789> looking<00:07:12.120> at<00:07:12.270> I'm<00:07:12.389> probably<00:07:12.599> gonna<00:07:12.780> get

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
we're looking at I'm probably gonna get

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.529 
we're looking at I'm probably gonna get
in<00:07:13.050> another<00:07:13.259> 20<00:07:13.590> minutes<00:07:13.770> out<00:07:14.009> of<00:07:14.039> there<00:07:14.280> maybe

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
in another 20 minutes out of there maybe

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:17.659 
in another 20 minutes out of there maybe
thirty<00:07:15.539> minutes<00:07:15.960> so<00:07:16.199> close<00:07:16.470> to<00:07:16.650> an<00:07:16.740> hour<00:07:16.919> and

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669 
thirty minutes so close to an hour and

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.730 
thirty minutes so close to an hour and
that<00:07:17.970> burnin<00:07:18.389> I<00:07:18.539> mean<00:07:18.750> it<00:07:18.900> provides<00:07:19.259> light<00:07:19.560> to

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
that burnin I mean it provides light to

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.350 
that burnin I mean it provides light to
keep<00:07:19.889> away<00:07:20.130> the<00:07:20.250> boogeyman<00:07:20.729> if<00:07:20.849> you<00:07:20.940> down<00:07:21.120> here

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
keep away the boogeyman if you down here

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.060 
keep away the boogeyman if you down here
not<00:07:21.630> or<00:07:21.840> camping<00:07:22.199> out<00:07:22.320> at<00:07:22.470> night<00:07:22.650> if<00:07:22.800> you<00:07:22.889> had

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.790 
not or camping out at night if you had
to<00:07:23.280> and<00:07:23.599> also<00:07:24.599> provides<00:07:25.199> a<00:07:25.349> little<00:07:25.470> bit<00:07:25.680> of

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
to and also provides a little bit of

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.379 
to and also provides a little bit of
heat<00:07:25.949> I'm<00:07:26.130> sure<00:07:26.340> you<00:07:26.460> gets<00:07:26.639> it<00:07:26.820> a<00:07:26.849> couple<00:07:27.090> rocks

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:27.389 
heat I'm sure you gets it a couple rocks

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.060 
heat I'm sure you gets it a couple rocks
on<00:07:27.630> either<00:07:27.720> side<00:07:28.110> of<00:07:28.139> the<00:07:28.320> flame<00:07:28.590> there<00:07:28.830> may<00:07:29.039> be

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.070 
on either side of the flame there may be

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:53.950 
on either side of the flame there may be
some<00:07:29.940> water<00:07:34.580> all<00:07:35.580> right

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.910 

so<00:07:54.740> anyway<00:07:55.070> so<00:07:55.130> I'm<00:07:55.340> signing<00:07:55.639> off
