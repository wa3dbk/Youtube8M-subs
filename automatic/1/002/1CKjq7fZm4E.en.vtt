00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
in a load object but I haven't

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
in a load object but I haven't
programmed<00:00:36.420> anything<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> I'm<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.500> can

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
fairly easy to do and so yeah also my

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.110 
fairly easy to do and so yeah also my
voice<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.250> might<00:00:56.370> sound<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.730> weird

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
voice it might sound a little weird

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.270 
voice it might sound a little weird
because<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> talking<00:00:59.070> loud

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
because I'm really kind of talking loud

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.069 
because I'm really kind of talking loud
because<00:00:59.760> I've<00:01:00.030> noticed<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.570> last<00:01:00.750> videos

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
because I've noticed in my last videos

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
because I've noticed in my last videos
that<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> audio<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.430> low<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.660> believe

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that the audio is so low and I believe

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
that the audio is so low and I believe
it's<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:05.180> editing<00:01:06.180> software

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it's because my editing software

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.469 
it's because my editing software
whenever<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.740> transfer<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> recordings<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
whenever I transfer the recordings that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.890 
whenever I transfer the recordings that
I've<00:01:09.659> created<00:01:10.170> over<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:12.000> noticed<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
I've created over in it I noticed that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.820 
I've created over in it I noticed that
it<00:01:13.400> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> kills<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> volume<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.509> bit

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
it kind of kills the volume a little bit

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.260 
it kind of kills the volume a little bit
so<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.100> try<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> talk<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:18.000> louder

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
so I'm gonna try to talk a little louder

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810 
so I'm gonna try to talk a little louder
in<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.570> video<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.200> we'll<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.490> happens

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
in this video and we'll see what happens

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.359 
in this video and we'll see what happens
so<00:01:21.330> yeah<00:01:21.750> anyway<00:01:22.080> basically<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> first<00:01:23.189> thing

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
so yeah anyway basically the first thing

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.060 
so yeah anyway basically the first thing
that<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:25.409> recommend

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that you want to do I would recommend

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
that you want to do I would recommend
you<00:01:26.340> create<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.729> save<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.150> load<00:01:27.270> sprite<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you create a save and load sprite just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
you create a save and load sprite just
to<00:01:27.930> test<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> feel<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to test this out you know get a feel for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.940 
to test this out you know get a feel for
the<00:01:30.180> saving<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.659> loading<00:01:30.810> system<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.530> option

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the saving and loading system or option

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.990 
the saving and loading system or option
rather<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.460> game<00:01:32.700> maker

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
rather in game maker

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.240 
rather in game maker
so<00:01:33.600> yeah<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.229> create<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> simple<00:01:34.650> save<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so yeah just create a simple save and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.550 
so yeah just create a simple save and
load<00:01:35.310> sprite<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.880> well<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.600> save<00:01:36.780> save<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
load sprite as well as save save and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
load sprite as well as save save and
load<00:01:37.619> object<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.270> anyway<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> first

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
load object and so anyway the first

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.910 
load object and so anyway the first
thing<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.930> we're<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.560> we're<00:01:40.860> gonna

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna
go<00:01:41.400> into<00:01:41.610> our<00:01:41.640> saving<00:01:42.000> objects<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
go into our saving objects here and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
go into our saving objects here and
we're<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.380> add<00:01:43.590> event<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> we're<00:01:45.090> gonna<00:01:45.210> go

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
we're gonna add event and we're gonna go

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.679
