00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.540
 tell the beautiful youtube people everything 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.300
 Right here with you, who's there? 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.549
 talking is the beginning of the team x bringing 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.870
 to you recently it was day care 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.029
 31 gameplay 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.529
 I played just three games 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 who was able to play this was the third 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.699
 This is somebody cool, thanks. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.740
 the channel and I'll speak my impressions 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.840
 this game I think he jumped 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.179
 front and gave an evolved 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.730
 first if you have the choice between 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.440
 play it on the console and on the pc 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.559
 I believe you have no option to play in the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.780
 pc on pc is more beautiful is cheaper and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 it works better then this 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.500
 we have no doubt these two had a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360
 problem that is the connection to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 you find lobby at least in the xbox that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.719
 was the platform where I played and finished 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 being a bit boring 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.789
 s3 as far as I can see now it's very good 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.039
 the servers are dedicated, ie without 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.949
 suffering with mild converse ground without 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.359
 suffering a Russian a church in others 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 things you see in games like 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.439
 future, but it is logical that there is a certain 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 side the American servers that was 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.720
 playing with a team from 150 to 180 which 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.670
 did not disturb my 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 I think you will see that the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 which includes and is nice with the implant a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.390
 person who is in the bic is playing for 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.509
 third time in the game and managed to get one 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.220
 23/9 which was very rewarding for me I 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.070
 I'll start playing there with this shot gun. 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.350
 that the scout class will soon soon 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.829
 I 'm going to move to the basic class of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 assault rifle and the legal shot gun more 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.340
 You have to play with a lot of strategy. 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.130
 thinking a lot of chilling that he 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 also has its peculiarities and was 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 cool for me sic your first time 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.000
 I see as a beating I was doing I 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.030
 turned the mouse button to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.330
 your range has a wrong setback and is 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.610
 At this time you have to act. 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.620
 Until the right day of daycare is when you 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.890
 You're giving me small balls. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.600
 bourgeois people of talks on the mouse to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.370
 that he does not lose his sights and that works 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.660
 Very well. See you soon. 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 I'm going to change the shock with the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.600
 assault and direct vote using this 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.920
 and I'm going to become much more 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.260
 need 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.210
 Another interesting thing to note is the 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.930
 armor operation he changed 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.940
 now 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.000
 once you spent energy from 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.560
 armor for you to run the bride if you have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 a very high speed 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 but spend a lot of energy you had is 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.410
 star world that spent energy from 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.930
 armor and love music also spent 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.970
 now he still has the armo and mobile hotel 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.980
 they expend direct energy like this when 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.930
 you equip them when you activate them 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.400
 are characters and put a little more 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.040
 slowly if you want to force 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.830
 occur the energy of battery power 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.170
 the amateur will end up much faster 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.820
 the amateur's energy by chance is that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.600
 is that the indicator in the corner 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.280
 lower right 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.780
 if you want to take a look and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.690
 follow in the black river understand the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.760
 but the novelty is that 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.510
 run do not wear armor do not spend 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.269
 energy 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.160
 This has changed a lot for anyone play now 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.450
 Do you feel as agile as you can? 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.870
 enjoy more 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.489
 It's your frame and I think you only have the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.120
 to win with this change 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.890
 and another thing is that he also equips 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.690
 automatically the max an organ or 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.860
 when you start taking damage for him 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.989
 have fallen from a high height 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.000
 automatically creative armor for 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.980
 you take less damage which makes the game 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.720
 a little more agile and you do not get so 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.280
 worried about the keys and the scene I 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.800
 find someone now better go 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.290
 better not activate then it facilitates 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.480
 quite logical if you meditate and 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.320
 active before your enemy everything works 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.600
 much better 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.330
 then these changes I felt and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.390
 mechanics that were super collective in 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.560
 terms of art and graphic daycare is 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.540
 destroyer 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.969
 You are seeing on the screen, right? 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.799
 It's pro game it's beautiful and super me made the 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.719
 Sceneries are very cool too. 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.909
 not always have levels of 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.290
 verticality which makes it one of 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.299
 skills that for me were a little 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.060
 in the extremely useful 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.010
 the ground that when you jump tightens 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.040
 the serenity key punches the ground and gives 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.439
 a free- zone damage kills anyone who has 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.390
 down then a very fun skill 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.680
 cool good time to use that 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.349
 People were a little on the side I'm 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.750
 feeling good with this map layout 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.120
 will be much more used game mode 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.590
 I'm using there is the crash sites that the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.289
 so if I'm not mistaken, I already had 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.030
 cry these two which is a kind of 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.280
 location that has the safe's brother 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.139
 I run a business in the middle of a 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.500
 and you have to stay in an area 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.400
 next to his team and winning 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.729
 The dots 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.740
 super good fun mode is not approved 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.900
 also has some differences and frustration 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.320
 The first one I got two that the strike out 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.599
 the first was the famous radar is the iv 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.430
 nintendo with the time when it is classic 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.650
 multiplayer shooting game 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.110
 the second was different the second is 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.120
 a kind of missile spear of yours 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.830
 start in the right port 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.210
 I got two in that one-I match. 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.130
 I cut because I wanted to leave the gameplay 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.010
 more public but the other you will see 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.050
 I can not use it that way. 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.070
 effective because you know what it 's like 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.130
 still well 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.720
 but finally in the binomial name you can already have 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.919
 an idea of ​​how the equipment is 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.110
 if I 'm not mistaken there's a mac too 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.530
 big I did not get to get this click 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.620
 huh 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.449
 he takes my 357 is basic does not 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.520
 does not have freshness is very simple 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.800
 to understand in this forest three win kills 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.650
 being in another map of 7 gained another eu 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.930
 I did not arrive on set but I saw a galley 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.110
 in other games there with the giant macs 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.240
 I believe this is the street seth 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.500
 so I thought it was cool too 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.220
 new things 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.020
 continues with strong customization 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.729
 The game is really cool, my 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.560
 first impressions were great 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.139
 It's one of the games I've been waiting for 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.130
 this year and it sure will not 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.470
 to disappoint 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.479
 just have to see the campaign that good 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.280
 I have other high expectations for 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.419
 the campaign and I do not think they will 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.700
 to disappoint me 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.790
 if you are to play a difficult 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.190
 You only have one account at a time. 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.220
 who goes down the game and gives a 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.110
 increased logic and daycare is from the 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.870
 start it now is not so much but the 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.060
 beginning it was known as a test 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.710
 for your video card now he's 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.660
 A little lighter this gives you 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.230
 change many optimize settings 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.270
 but he's still a lightweight player, right? 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.470
 so it's good to also pay attention to 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.370
 example I have been converted to 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.080
 interconnected 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.970
 so he was totally moving 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.160
 strange in the first matches of the 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.540
 team and set up and once I've already 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.210
 I had five runs everything. 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.060
 wonderfully I can play 60 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.050
 frames per second is logical 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.460
 that the recording they are seeing 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.200
 unfortunately at 30 frames that is 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.430
 feature of the recording program 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.500
 that I use 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.990
 But I do not think it will stop you from seeing 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.570
 How is the game and has some new things. 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.160
 cool guys too now when the 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.780
 game instead of you see a way the 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.610
 of a person you see your 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.050
 better moments because it's okay 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.210
 rewarding is it cool for you to remember 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.390
 with one thumb it was that game 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.760
 finally many good news has now 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.470
 will stay and with the best moments that 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.060
 The game is over, I wanted to 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.520
 thank you for attending to 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.630
 can not rate or help a favorite 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.250
 online and this helps me a lot with 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.810
 situation makes me happy and makes me want to 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.970
 make more cool videos 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.190
 So, these people, thank you so much for 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.480
 I'm leaving you guys. 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.120
 to the very end of gameplay 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.120
 A big hug and until the next video
