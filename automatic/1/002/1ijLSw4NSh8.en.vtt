 let's put here a little 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 impalpable sugar to rise a little bit 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.610
 because this mass of milk is very cool 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.250

 my will is small to carry a table 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.900
 bigger is much easier and work hard 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.020
