one and basically what you're gonna need
is<00:00:21.960> an<00:00:22.920> ice<00:00:23.130> cube<00:00:23.430> tray<00:00:25.670> some<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.090> wax<00:00:27.300> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
is an ice cube tray some some wax it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.849 
is an ice cube tray some some wax it
doesn't<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.109> paraffin<00:00:28.470> wax<00:00:28.710> like

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
doesn't have to be paraffin wax like

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.220 
doesn't have to be paraffin wax like
this<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:30.150> old<00:00:30.269> candle<00:00:31.430> it<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.550> be

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
this it can be an old candle it can be

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
this it can be an old candle it can be
beeswax<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.710> any<00:00:35.219> type<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> wax<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.300> will

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
beeswax or any type of wax so that will

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
beeswax or any type of wax so that will
work<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.559> type<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> burner<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:39.770> ideally

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
work some type of burner and ideally

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.040 
work some type of burner and ideally
something<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.489> sawdust<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> guess<00:00:42.930> some

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
something like sawdust so I guess some

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.400 
something like sawdust so I guess some
sawdust<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.649> shavings<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.410> if

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
sawdust here shavings that I got and if

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
sawdust here shavings that I got and if
you<00:00:46.590> want<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> double<00:00:47.250> boiler<00:00:47.520> by

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you want to do a double boiler by

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.779 
you want to do a double boiler by
putting<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> wax<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> glass<00:00:50.280> bowl<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
putting the wax in like a glass bowl and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
putting the wax in like a glass bowl and
floating<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:52.020> hot<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
floating that in some hot water that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.450 
floating that in some hot water that
will<00:00:52.739> work<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:54.620> find<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.219> cook<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
will work I find that I can just cook it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
will work I find that I can just cook it
directly<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.840> melt<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> directly<00:00:58.469> in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
directly in here or melt it directly in

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
directly in here or melt it directly in
here<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.430> stove<00:00:59.670> top<00:01:00.199> without<00:01:01.199> any<00:01:01.559> issue

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
here on the stove top without any issue

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
here on the stove top without any issue
as<00:01:02.070> long<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.489> monitor<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.470> tell

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
as long as I monitor it and I don't tell

basically I'm just gonna take some of
this<00:01:17.549> these<00:01:17.880> shavings<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.960> sawdust<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.119> fill

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
this these shavings and sawdust and fill

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
this these shavings and sawdust and fill
up<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> ice<00:01:21.780> trays<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.770> know

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
up some of the ice trays I don't know

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
up some of the ice trays I don't know
how<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.159> wax<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.570> I'll

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
how much wax I actually have but I'll

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.940 
how much wax I actually have but I'll
just<00:01:24.840> fill<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.380> many<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:26.549> these<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.060> can

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.649 

all<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.189> once<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> trays

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
all right so once you get the trays

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.679 
all right so once you get the trays
filled<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.520> it's<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.180> ready<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
filled up it's pretty much ready for the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
filled up it's pretty much ready for the
wax<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> we'll<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.340> how<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:38.610> doing<00:01:38.850> we

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
wax and we'll see how we're doing we

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
wax and we'll see how we're doing we
still<00:01:39.150> got<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.630> left<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.110> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
still got a little bit left to go so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
still got a little bit left to go so
I'll<00:01:40.500> let<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.770> melt<00:01:41.280> completely<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.000> then

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I'll let this melt completely and then

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.840 
I'll let this melt completely and then
you<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.930> pour<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> we'll

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you just pour it in there and we'll

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.660 
you just pour it in there and we'll
throw<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> freezer<00:01:46.310> all<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.460> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
throw it in the freezer all right so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.819 
throw it in the freezer all right so
it's<00:01:47.820> melted<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.049> simple<00:01:49.409> process

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it's melted it's pretty simple process

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.010 
it's melted it's pretty simple process
you<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.310> fill<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.570> were<00:01:51.689> filling

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you just fill it like you were filling

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
you just fill it like you were filling
them<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.140> water<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.299> fill<00:01:54.479> them

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
them with water but you just fill them

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
them with water but you just fill them
with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.840> wax<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:57.350> you'll<00:01:58.350> notice<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
with the wax and you'll notice that the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
with the wax and you'll notice that the
sawdust<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.360> expand<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:01.469> bit<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sawdust will expand a little bit as it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.840 
sawdust will expand a little bit as it
absorbs<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:04.020> wax

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.720 

so<00:02:08.850> actually<00:02:09.150> I<00:02:09.180> didn't<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.480> enough<00:02:09.870> to<00:02:10.730> get

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so actually I didn't have enough to get

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.430 
so actually I didn't have enough to get
all<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> trades<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.960> pour<00:02:13.200> some

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
all the trades to see if I can pour some

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:30.850 
all the trades to see if I can pour some
of<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.650> stuff<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.730> other<00:02:14.910> ones

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.010 

you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.760> see<00:02:31.880> I'm<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.030> draining<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.660> out<00:02:32.840> in

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
you can see I'm just draining it out in

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
you can see I'm just draining it out in
the<00:02:33.110> pan<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.660> then<00:02:38.990> I'm<00:02:39.140> gonna<00:02:39.260> floor<00:02:39.920> it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
the pan and then I'm gonna floor it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.030 
the pan and then I'm gonna floor it
again<00:02:40.280> into<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.760> ones<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.800> didn't<00:02:42.800> really

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
again into the ones that didn't really

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.690 
again into the ones that didn't really
get<00:02:43.220> much<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.650> sadhus<00:02:49.190> will<00:02:49.370> actually

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
get much and so the sadhus will actually

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.860 
get much and so the sadhus will actually
reach<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.000> saturation<00:02:50.210> point<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:52.460> so<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.750> can

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
reach a saturation point and so you can

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.210 
reach a saturation point and so you can
just<00:02:54.050> pour<00:02:54.290> off<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.650> extra

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
just pour off the extra

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.810 
just pour off the extra
once<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.580> all<00:02:55.700> saturated<00:02:57.490> all<00:02:58.490> right<00:02:58.670> so

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
once it's all saturated all right so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.310 
once it's all saturated all right so
that's<00:02:58.940> good<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.300> go<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.870> can<00:02:59.959> see<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
that's good to go so you can see the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.620 
that's good to go so you can see the
trays<00:03:00.580> there's<00:03:01.580> not<00:03:01.760> what<00:03:02.000> again<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.570> don't

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
trays there's not what again you don't

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.120 
trays there's not what again you don't
want<00:03:02.720> wax<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.470> water<00:03:03.709> if<00:03:03.980> you're

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
want wax just like water if you're

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.130 
want wax just like water if you're
making<00:03:04.280> ice<00:03:05.000> cubes<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.510> don't<00:03:05.660> want<00:03:05.780> them<00:03:05.930> all

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
making ice cubes you don't want them all

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.780 
making ice cubes you don't want them all
covered<00:03:06.530> over<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.070> want<00:03:07.250> individual

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
covered over so you want individual

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.490 
covered over so you want individual
cubes<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.390> these<00:03:08.750> gonna<00:03:08.930> act<00:03:09.170> as<00:03:09.350> your

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
cubes and these gonna act as your

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.870 
cubes and these gonna act as your
individual<00:03:09.890> firestarter<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:10.580> I'm<00:03:10.670> just<00:03:10.790> gonna

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
individual firestarter so I'm just gonna

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.300 
individual firestarter so I'm just gonna
throw<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.270> in<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> freezer<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:12.020> about<00:03:12.800> 15

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
throw this in the freezer for about 15

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.090 
throw this in the freezer for about 15
minutes<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:14.410> pull<00:03:15.410> one<00:03:15.560> out<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.739> show<00:03:15.920> you

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
minutes and pull one out and show you

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.390 
minutes and pull one out and show you
how<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.459> works

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
how it works

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.440 
how it works
all<00:03:19.400> right<00:03:19.520> so<00:03:19.610> we're<00:03:19.730> gonna<00:03:19.790> pull<00:03:20.120> out<00:03:20.209> these

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
all right so we're gonna pull out these

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.750 
all right so we're gonna pull out these
jobbies<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.560> they're<00:03:24.770> cold<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.190> touch<00:03:25.280> and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
jobbies so they're cold to the touch and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.220 
jobbies so they're cold to the touch and
you<00:03:26.090> want<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.360> make<00:03:26.570> sure<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.900> they're<00:03:27.050> not

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
you want to make sure that they're not

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.110 
you want to make sure that they're not
soft<00:03:27.590> anymore<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.430> should<00:03:28.610> be<00:03:28.700> nice<00:03:28.880> and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
soft anymore this should be nice and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.740 
soft anymore this should be nice and
stiff<00:03:29.330> if<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:31.090> take<00:03:32.090> them<00:03:32.209> out<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.570> ice

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
stiff if you take them out just like ice

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.380 
stiff if you take them out just like ice
cubes<00:03:33.080> they<00:03:33.200> should<00:03:33.410> come<00:03:33.590> out<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.250> we'll<00:03:38.120> take

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
cubes they should come out so we'll take

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.699 
cubes they should come out so we'll take
out<00:03:38.540> these<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:39.049> basically<00:03:39.290> what<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.530> can<00:03:39.560> see

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
out these but basically what you can see

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.780 
out these but basically what you can see
it's<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.820> block<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.660> wax<00:03:41.930> with<00:03:42.790> some

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
it's just a block of wax with some

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.539 
it's just a block of wax with some
sawdust<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:45.080> in<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.769> nice<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:45.950> waterproof

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
sawdust so in the nice and waterproof

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.820 
sawdust so in the nice and waterproof
because<00:03:46.760> they<00:03:47.239> have<00:03:47.510> their<00:03:48.080> impregnated<00:03:48.709> with

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
because they have their impregnated with

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.000 
because they have their impregnated with
wax<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.630> they're<00:03:50.780> great<00:03:50.989> little<00:03:51.799> fire

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
wax so they're great little fire

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.530 
wax so they're great little fire
starters<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.610> we'll<00:03:52.730> go<00:03:52.850> outside<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.360> just

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
starters and we'll go outside and just

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.140 
starters and we'll go outside and just
I'll<00:03:53.780> show<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.019> how<00:03:54.170> how<00:03:54.799> well<00:03:55.040> they<00:03:55.190> work<00:03:55.400> all

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
I'll show you how how well they work all

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.310 
I'll show you how how well they work all
right<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:56.360> we're<00:03:56.480> gonna<00:03:56.540> start<00:03:56.660> one<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.200> these

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
right so we're gonna start one of these

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.720 
right so we're gonna start one of these
guys<00:03:57.500> up<00:03:57.799> so<00:04:00.010> once<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.130> get<00:04:01.220> them<00:04:01.400> going<00:04:01.580> you

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
guys up so once you get them going you

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.640 
guys up so once you get them going you
can<00:04:01.940> see<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.420> it's<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.290> fuel

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
can see that it it's just like a fuel

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.520 
can see that it it's just like a fuel
you<00:04:04.190> can<00:04:04.250> see<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.580> wind<00:04:04.790> even<00:04:05.000> hits<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.200> it

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
you can see the wind even hits it and it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.000 
you can see the wind even hits it and it
doesn't<00:04:06.680> extinguish<00:04:07.420> even<00:04:08.420> in<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.739> slight<00:04:09.739> rain

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
doesn't extinguish even in a slight rain

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.009 
doesn't extinguish even in a slight rain
they're<00:04:10.190> not<00:04:10.310> gonna<00:04:10.459> extinguish<00:04:10.880> they<00:04:11.209> last

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
they're not gonna extinguish they last

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.099 
they're not gonna extinguish they last
pretty<00:04:12.320> good<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.830> so<00:04:16.390> we'll<00:04:17.390> let<00:04:17.479> those<00:04:17.600> burn

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
pretty good so so we'll let those burn

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.480 
pretty good so so we'll let those burn
for<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.350> little<00:04:18.530> bit

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.890 

so<00:04:26.490> as<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.639> can<00:04:26.759> see<00:04:26.819> they<00:04:27.090> stayed<00:04:27.360> lit<00:04:27.569> even

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
so as you can see they stayed lit even

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.890 
so as you can see they stayed lit even
on<00:04:28.020> top<00:04:28.259> of<00:04:28.439> snow<00:04:28.699> if<00:04:29.699> it<00:04:30.150> were<00:04:30.300> even<00:04:30.449> raining

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
on top of snow if it were even raining

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.379 
on top of snow if it were even raining
for<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.080> little<00:04:31.289> bit<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:32.789> right<00:04:33.090> now<00:04:33.240> it's
