00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.990
 Lord of life 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 at this time of the morning I have thought 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 civilians account that in my ears loneliness 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 there was more 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.200
 the start of all the problems are saying were you waiting 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.100
 to solve the case 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 I can doubt the things 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.870

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.700
 Lord of life 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.470
 once tourists on the cross to show such great love to the world 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 and especially 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.880
 I do not find reason why a man died 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 not only for love 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 but I can say 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 that this was life teaching 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 so that the morgue 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 existed 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.810
