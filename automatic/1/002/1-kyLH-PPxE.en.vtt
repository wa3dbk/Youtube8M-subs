they'd<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.420> me<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> bring<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.619> sounds

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
they'd like me to bring so it sounds

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.419 
they'd like me to bring so it sounds
strange<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:28.170> very<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.560> you

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
strange but it is really very good you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.769 
strange but it is really very good you
know<00:00:29.550> there's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> lot<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.119> sodium<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.660> it's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
know there's a lot of sodium so it's

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.389 
know there's a lot of sodium so it's
probably<00:00:31.109> not<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.470> healthiest<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> but

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
probably not the healthiest for you but

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.370 
probably not the healthiest for you but
it<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:34.050> need<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> eat

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it is what it is you don't need to eat

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.389 
it is what it is you don't need to eat
the<00:00:34.440> whole<00:00:34.590> plate<00:00:34.920> that's<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.430> say<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.420> um

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
the whole plate that's what I say so um

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.250 
the whole plate that's what I say so um
it<00:00:38.399> seems<00:00:38.790> fairly<00:00:39.030> simple<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> Tam<00:00:39.930> cream

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it seems fairly simple a Tam cream

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
it seems fairly simple a Tam cream
cheese<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.649> pickle<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> thought<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> would

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
cheese and pickle but I thought I would

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
cheese and pickle but I thought I would
just<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.989> quick<00:00:43.260> video<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> show

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
just do a really quick video and show

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
just do a really quick video and show
you<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.789> tips<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> tricks<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> have

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you the tips and tricks that I have

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.389 
you the tips and tricks that I have
learned<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.530> years<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.920> making<00:00:47.070> these

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
learned over the years of making these

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.850 
learned over the years of making these
then<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> lot<00:00:48.660> easier<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
then make it a lot easier and so that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
then make it a lot easier and so that
they<00:00:49.950> turn<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.730> better<00:00:50.910> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
they turn out a little bit better so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
they turn out a little bit better so
truly<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.440> need<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> jar<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.460> pickles
