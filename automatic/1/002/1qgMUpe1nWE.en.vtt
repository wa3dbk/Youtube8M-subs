different<00:00:14.670> areas<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.299> need<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.480> look<00:00:15.780> at

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
different areas that we need to look at

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.460 
different areas that we need to look at
to<00:00:16.800> improve<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.789> loss<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> atopic

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to improve the loss of the atopic

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679 
to improve the loss of the atopic
patient<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.119> area<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.600> we

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
patient and the first area that we

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
looked up with allergen avoidance so we

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.529 
looked up with allergen avoidance so we
know<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.539> dogs<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> cats<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.680> very
