00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
feel privileged we saw the whole part

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.570 
feel privileged we saw the whole part
from<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.580> top<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.330> a<00:00:45.360> moonshine<00:00:46.040> it<00:00:47.040> was<00:00:47.250> so

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
from the top with a moonshine it was so

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
from the top with a moonshine it was so
good<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.150> was<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:49.520> physically<00:00:50.520> 34<00:00:51.270> different

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
good I was like physically 34 different

00:00:51.600 --> 00:02:58.060 
good I was like physically 34 different
like<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> park<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> amazing

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.890 

it's<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.130> lot<00:02:59.340> harder<00:02:59.610> doing<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.270> like<00:03:00.780> you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
it's a lot harder doing it like you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.200 
it's a lot harder doing it like you
don't<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.680> spots<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.490> didn't<00:03:03.090> teach

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
don't have the same spots I didn't teach

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.150 
don't have the same spots I didn't teach
you<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.600> orientate<00:03:03.990> yourself<00:03:04.020> then<00:03:04.890> we<00:03:05.040> have

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
you to orientate yourself then we have

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.740 
you to orientate yourself then we have
the<00:03:05.340> knuckle<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.940> landing<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.390> takeoff

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the knuckle in the landing and takeoff

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
the knuckle in the landing and takeoff
so<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.110> makes<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.500> lot<00:03:07.710> harder<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.460> in<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so it makes it a lot harder like in the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.670 
so it makes it a lot harder like in the
original<00:03:08.790> where<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.450> are<00:03:09.540> something<00:03:10.200> but

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
original where you are something but

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.590 
original where you are something but
ever<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.610> do<00:03:11.730> trick<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.270> know<00:03:12.390> how<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
ever so we do trick that we know how to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.850 
ever so we do trick that we know how to
do<00:03:12.960> an<00:03:13.170> end<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.560> work<00:03:13.740> site

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.920
