00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.660
 today from a well-known putter 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.549
 many and many many many 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.710
 youtubers have done allows much desire 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.070
 of doing it in the 7 peca2 capitals of 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.600
 reading and good here goes like I do not have 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.540
 books at hand because only what 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.020
 I am going to say and there I will then in certain 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.840
 Name (s 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.539
 the first is greed when this 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.510
 most expensive book and the cheapest one that 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.329
 you have the most expensive book that I have is a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.720
 book that cost around two thousand 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.050
 pesos without hands I remember and it's called 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.060
 literary theory of rené smells and austin 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.980
 Warren is a book apparently quite 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.520
 known and published in the history 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.920
 gredos and gredos is famous with its books 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.450
 very expensive in that same point is what is 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.239
 the cheapest that I have more books 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.590
 cheap that I have cost me 10 pesos and they are 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.050
 the details in the desert of joseph 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.370
 emilio pacheco I bought it with a man 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.799
 that he put the share 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.650
 and letters and sold used books I think 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.260
 that still gets closed but there what 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.759
 I bought the next point and converts it 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.850
 inter you maintain a relationship of 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.580
 love-hate is mario vargas llosa because 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.580
 I love your books I love towards 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.890
 dogs there are many books which there 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.960
 to choose what I like very much without 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.090
 But a time for here I am 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.610
 talking about how about 20 years here 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.549
 all statements your articles 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.950
 regarding the art of culture and 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.619
 politics make me win issues of 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.270
 hang it because sweet because they make their 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.729
 things and have nothing to do with what 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.110
 he puts in his books but hey that's 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.140
 my love-hate relationship because in reality 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.670
 We do not go for his books but not for his 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.649
 statements but they are things 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.000
 independent the next point is 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.310
 glutton the book to erase again and again 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.900
 so he left the arrow but book 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.940
 that I have gone many times because I 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.500
 love is ten years of loneliness 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.450
 gabriel garcía marquez I had the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.240
 opportunity to read or the faculty but 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.460
 then later I loved it I read it again 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.530
 and then I read it again when I gave classes 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
 no secondaries with my students and then 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.030
 my brother what he did reads and well I 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.459
 I put to read it with him and well really 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.290
 every I can and there is some excuse for 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.420
 the law of oil but it's like more 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.640
 sporadic on the other hand there is another 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.250
 book that I can open in any 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.260
 moment and put a short text and I 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.209
 love and it's a knot in July cortázar 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.709
 that is called the return a day in 80 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.810
 Worlds is a book that I like 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.040
 very many are two as young children who do not 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.840
 He knows how to serve also you can open it 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.850
 any time and I always have it to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.940
 the hand to comment on the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.590
 experiments next point laziness that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.590
 the most read book for laziness 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.910
 the day sin that the ulises of joyce 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.530
 being that I'm not yet ready to 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.050
 the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.780
 and the truth is that I have a lot 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.209
 Curious to read it but it gives me a lot 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.910
 lazy to get into it because I feel that 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.280
 I'm going to need it a lot of time and 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.720
 head to write and some time 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.880
 prepared maybe I'll go through 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.819
 high many things that exist more 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.400
 prepared to improve the following 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.280
 Pride point that the book speaks for 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 part of intellectual because in reality not 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.730
 I speak without any book to appear 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.550
 intellectuals like that I like that wave 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.739
 but there are books that have left me many 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.230
 reflections and that have cost me a lot 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.390
 work of the then at this point 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.180
 there is a book that I read like that recently 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.180
 it will be about two or three months called 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.040
 unique piece by milorad pavic fabric no 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.709
 I know how to pronounce it and it was a book that 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.420
 It took me a lot of work to read and it brought me 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.220
 many complications but not abnormal 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.130
 meaning but it really was a 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.290
 challenger generated a lot of doubts and 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.630
 I had to consult and I think it's a 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.120
 book that I have not talked about him but what 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.930
 I would recommend if I would say that 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.750
 they require an effort 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.939
 lust that in any attraction is a 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.280
 male or female character 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.290
 I think what I find most attractive 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.060
 of a man's literature is a 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.719
 male character is that he has 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.549
 decided 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.099
 beyond brave I think it has 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.660
 decided that not before as I do not know 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.489
 I feel there are characters that lose 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.120
 too much the important things weapons already 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.860
 things then life itself by 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.500
 that I like the determined characters 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.940
 although I see him as james hunters of 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.639
 shadows that I adore because I feel 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.930
 I am very determined because I do like 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.259
 the characters that in a few words 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.539
 they say a lot and finally I fall in love 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.300
 very much that they have a good sense of 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.090
 humor as in the preliminary report of 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.789
