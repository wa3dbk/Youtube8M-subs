have<00:00:10.370> on<00:00:10.700> draining<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:11.690> radiator<00:00:12.320> which<00:00:12.470> I

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:12.560 
have on draining the radiator which I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.720 
have on draining the radiator which I
didn't<00:00:12.740> cover<00:00:12.890> in<00:00:13.070> my<00:00:13.160> first<00:00:13.370> series<00:00:13.700> of

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
didn't cover in my first series of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.380 
didn't cover in my first series of
videos<00:00:14.770> this<00:00:15.770> is<00:00:15.830> how<00:00:16.070> I<00:00:16.130> do<00:00:16.280> it<00:00:16.550> it's<00:00:17.180> usually

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
videos this is how I do it it's usually

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.350 
videos this is how I do it it's usually
a<00:00:17.600> pretty<00:00:17.900> good<00:00:18.650> way<00:00:18.800> to<00:00:18.830> do<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:19.160> in<00:00:19.910> fact<00:00:20.119> it's

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
a pretty good way to do it in fact it's

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.180 
a pretty good way to do it in fact it's
the<00:00:20.420> only<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.050> do<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:21.260> really<00:00:21.529> with<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.740> elimo

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
the only to do it really with the elimo

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.940 
the only to do it really with the elimo
hose<00:00:23.020> what<00:00:24.020> I<00:00:24.080> do<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.380> take<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.560> radiator

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
hose what I do is I take the radiator

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.220 
hose what I do is I take the radiator
cap<00:00:25.100> off<00:00:25.450> which<00:00:26.450> allows<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.870> system<00:00:27.050> to

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
cap off which allows the system to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.190 
cap off which allows the system to
breathe<00:00:27.700> and<00:00:28.700> then<00:00:30.010> under<00:00:31.010> here<00:00:32.080> see<00:00:33.080> if<00:00:33.140> you

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
breathe and then under here see if you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.740 
breathe and then under here see if you
can<00:00:33.350> see<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.559> that<00:00:33.710> little<00:00:33.890> thing<00:00:34.190> with<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
can see it that little thing with the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.689 
can see it that little thing with the
butterfly<00:00:35.750> shape<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.199> it

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
butterfly shape to it

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.020 
butterfly shape to it
that's<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:37.940> actual<00:00:38.270> petcock<00:00:38.720> for<00:00:39.850> taking<00:00:40.850> the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
that's the actual petcock for taking the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.960 
that's the actual petcock for taking the
as<00:00:41.809> soon<00:00:42.020> as<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.230> screw<00:00:42.589> that<00:00:42.769> it'll<00:00:43.400> drain

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
as soon as you screw that it'll drain

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.520 
as soon as you screw that it'll drain
the<00:00:44.030> antifreeze<00:00:44.510> out<00:00:44.720> through<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:44.960> hole<00:00:45.290> in

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the antifreeze out through that hole in

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.600 
the antifreeze out through that hole in
fact<00:00:45.769> I<00:00:45.890> don't<00:00:45.949> know<00:00:46.159> if<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:46.339> can<00:00:46.460> see

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
fact I don't know if you can see

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.090 
fact I don't know if you can see
anything<00:00:46.790> dripping<00:00:47.239> off<00:00:47.330> it<00:00:47.510> or<00:00:47.629> not<00:00:51.040> into<00:00:52.040> a

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
anything dripping off it or not into a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.860 
anything dripping off it or not into a
bucket<00:00:53.769> from<00:00:54.769> here<00:00:55.239> if<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.360> like<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.629> drain

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
bucket from here if you like to drain

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.360 
bucket from here if you like to drain
the<00:00:57.019> block<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:57.620> not<00:00:57.769> going<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:57.949> do<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.159> on<00:00:58.250> this

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the block I'm not going to do it on this

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.110 
the block I'm not going to do it on this
one<00:00:58.989> so<00:00:59.989> instead<00:01:00.140> what<00:01:00.470> I'm<00:01:00.589> going<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.739> do<00:01:01.120> is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
one so instead what I'm going to do is

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.579 
one so instead what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:02.330> gonna<00:01:02.420> unclamp<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.989> hose<00:01:03.140> from<00:01:03.379> here

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
I'm gonna unclamp the hose from here

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.460 
I'm gonna unclamp the hose from here
from<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.220> actual<00:01:04.640> head<00:01:05.110> I'm<00:01:06.110> going<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.380> take

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
from the actual head I'm going to take

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.899 
from the actual head I'm going to take
the<00:01:06.590> lower<00:01:06.770> radiator<00:01:07.130> hose<00:01:07.250> off<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.640> the

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
the lower radiator hose off of the

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.010 
the lower radiator hose off of the
radiator<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.290> now<00:01:09.380> I<00:01:09.409> move<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.680> up<00:01:09.770> here<00:01:09.830> and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
radiator so now I move it up here and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.529 
radiator so now I move it up here and
trying<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.110> contain<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.500> system<00:01:12.830> there<00:01:13.539> then

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
trying to contain the system there then

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.450 
trying to contain the system there then
I'll<00:01:14.659> pull<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.049> longer<00:01:15.740> hose<00:01:15.920> off<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
I'll pull the longer hose off of the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.929 
I'll pull the longer hose off of the
heat<00:01:17.469> early<00:01:18.469> they<00:01:18.799> switch<00:01:19.189> from<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:19.460> heater

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
heat early they switch from the heater

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.529 
heat early they switch from the heater
you<00:01:20.930> know<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:21.079> pull<00:01:21.289> it<00:01:21.380> over<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:23.299> this

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
you know I pull it over here to this

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.490 
you know I pull it over here to this
hose<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.799> can<00:01:24.950> see<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.930> that<00:01:26.930> hose<00:01:27.229> which

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
hose so you can see that that hose which

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.399 
hose so you can see that that hose which
is<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.799> return<00:01:28.430> from<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.670> heater<00:01:29.409> further

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
is the return from the heater further

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.609 
is the return from the heater further
push<00:01:31.159> whatever<00:01:31.369> it's<00:01:31.789> on<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:33.530> will

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
push whatever it's on and that will

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.010 
push whatever it's on and that will
contain<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.950> antifreeze<00:01:34.670> within<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.240> block

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
contain the antifreeze within the block

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.450 
contain the antifreeze within the block
of<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.259> car<00:01:36.469> or<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> block<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.250> motor

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
of the car or a block of the motor

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.169 
of the car or a block of the motor
itself<00:01:38.799> as<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:40.070> see<00:01:40.189> on<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.429> one<00:01:40.640> I'm

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
itself as you can see on this one I'm

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.819 
itself as you can see on this one I'm
working<00:01:41.509> with<00:01:41.630> an<00:01:41.750> automatic<00:01:42.109> I<00:01:42.469> haven't

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
working with an automatic I haven't

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.319 
working with an automatic I haven't
covered<00:01:42.950> an<00:01:43.130> automatic<00:01:43.579> yet<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:43.939> I'm<00:01:44.030> gonna<00:01:44.090> do

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
covered an automatic yet so I'm gonna do

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.709 
covered an automatic yet so I'm gonna do
some<00:01:44.479> tonight<00:01:45.549> but<00:01:46.549> what<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.789> have<00:01:46.939> here<00:01:47.210> main

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
some tonight but what you have here main

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.380 
some tonight but what you have here main
differences<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.670> actual<00:01:49.939> engine<00:01:50.210> mount

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
differences is the actual engine mount

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.819 
differences is the actual engine mount
is<00:01:50.600> different<00:01:51.049> because<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.409> transmission

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
is different because the transmission

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.910 
is different because the transmission
sits<00:01:52.820> up<00:01:53.090> higher<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.049> there's<00:01:54.229> only<00:01:54.350> two<00:01:54.469> bolts

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
sits up higher so there's only two bolts

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950 
sits up higher so there's only two bolts
that<00:01:55.009> hold<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:55.369> in<00:01:55.520> instead<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.539> pulling<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that hold it in instead of pulling the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.359 
that hold it in instead of pulling the
mount<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:57.350> gonna<00:01:57.469> pull<00:01:57.679> these<00:01:57.770> two<00:01:57.950> bolts

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
mount I'm gonna pull these two bolts

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.959 
mount I'm gonna pull these two bolts
when<00:01:59.179> I<00:01:59.210> get<00:01:59.420> down<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.749> the<00:01:59.840> ground<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.939> I

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
when I get down on the ground that I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.889 
when I get down on the ground that I
also<00:02:02.299> down<00:02:02.570> here<00:02:02.869> on<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.969> torque<00:02:04.969> arm<00:02:05.240> there's

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
also down here on the torque arm there's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.050 
also down here on the torque arm there's
a<00:02:06.020> two<00:02:07.569> finger<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.960> hose<00:02:09.880> there's<00:02:10.880> two

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
a two finger on the hose there's two

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.320 
a two finger on the hose there's two
bolts<00:02:11.360> down<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:13.370> disconnect<00:02:14.120> from<00:02:14.210> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
bolts down here that disconnect from the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.820 
bolts down here that disconnect from the
transmission<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.350> gonna<00:02:15.470> pull<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
transmission but I'm just gonna pull the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.500 
transmission but I'm just gonna pull the
two<00:02:15.980> bolts<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.490> mount<00:02:16.670> itself<00:02:17.120> which<00:02:17.360> is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
two bolts on the mount itself which is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
two bolts on the mount itself which is
the<00:02:17.540> same<00:02:17.780> as<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.020> manual<00:02:18.380> one<00:02:18.620> I'll<00:02:19.370> try<00:02:19.550> to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
the same as the manual one I'll try to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.710 
the same as the manual one I'll try to
videotape<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.270> little<00:02:20.480> bit<00:02:20.570> better

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
videotape that a little bit better

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.930 
videotape that a little bit better
underneath<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:21.410> with<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:21.890> new<00:02:22.010> camera

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
underneath there with this new camera

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.250 
underneath there with this new camera
and<00:02:23.940> also<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.570> these<00:02:24.720> two<00:02:24.900> lines<00:02:25.110> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
and also you have these two lines that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.440 
and also you have these two lines that
come<00:02:25.470> down<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> they're<00:02:26.910> feed<00:02:27.120> into<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
come down and they're feed into the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.740 
come down and they're feed into the
radiator<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.460> those<00:02:29.460> are<00:02:29.750> transmission

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
radiator and those are transmission

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270 
radiator and those are transmission
cooling<00:02:31.230> lines<00:02:31.410> there's<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> cooler

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
cooling lines there's actually a cooler

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.480 
cooling lines there's actually a cooler
within<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> radiator<00:02:33.150> itself<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.490> usually

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
within the radiator itself and usually

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.790 
within the radiator itself and usually
what<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> do<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.910> those<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.570> can<00:02:36.900> drain<00:02:37.230> part

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
what I do with those is I can drain part

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.850 
what I do with those is I can drain part
of<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> system<00:02:38.280> through<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.770> I'll

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
of the system through that and then I'll

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.680 
of the system through that and then I'll
loop<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.130> hose<00:02:41.340> around<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.240> know<00:02:42.330> tightly<00:02:42.600> like

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
loop a hose around you know tightly like

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.330 
loop a hose around you know tightly like
take<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.020> side<00:02:43.590> off<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.040> loop<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.250> around

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
take this side off and loop it around

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.720 
take this side off and loop it around
this<00:02:44.670> one<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.030> clamp<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> also

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
this one and clamp it and then I also

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.630 
this one and clamp it and then I also
drain<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.270> transmission<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.400> can't

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
drain the transmission which you can't

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.720 
drain the transmission which you can't
see<00:02:50.730> right<00:02:51.090> now<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:52.010> I'll<00:02:53.010> cover<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.640> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
see right now but I'll cover that in a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.710 
see right now but I'll cover that in a
minute<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.330> bit<00:02:56.300> otherwise<00:02:57.300> it's<00:02:57.600> pretty

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
minute in a bit otherwise it's pretty

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.470 
minute in a bit otherwise it's pretty
much<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.140> same<00:02:58.170> deal<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.459> other<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.820> is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
much the same deal as the other one is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.720 
much the same deal as the other one is
the<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.050> mount<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.040> side<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the the mount over on this side and the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.070 
the the mount over on this side and the
mount<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.090> back<00:03:03.300> are<00:03:03.570> pretty<00:03:03.810> much<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
mount in the back are pretty much the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.680 
mount in the back are pretty much the
same<00:03:04.610> it's<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:05.910> transmission<00:03:06.510> mount

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
same it's just this transmission mount

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.550 
same it's just this transmission mount
that's<00:03:06.810> always<00:03:06.989> different<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:12.380> yeah<00:03:13.380> we'll

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
that's always different so yeah we'll

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.650 
that's always different so yeah we'll
see<00:03:13.709> how<00:03:14.070> much<00:03:14.250> more<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.850> get<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.390> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
see how much more I can get on this I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.510 
see how much more I can get on this I
