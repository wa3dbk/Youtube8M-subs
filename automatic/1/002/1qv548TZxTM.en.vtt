00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.820 

so<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.180> here<00:00:09.390> is<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.510> big<00:00:09.720> net<00:00:09.930> called<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.350> bowie

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so this here is a big net called a bowie

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.040 
so this here is a big net called a bowie
knife<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.430> used<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.510> called<00:00:12.720> the<00:00:12.870> knife

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
knife and used to be called the knife

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.039 
knife and used to be called the knife
that<00:00:13.230> cuts<00:00:13.469> two<00:00:13.770> ways<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.780> thinking<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.900> that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that cuts two ways and thinking on that

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.390 
that cuts two ways and thinking on that
is<00:00:16.200> that<00:00:16.320> some<00:00:16.529> people<00:00:16.560> will<00:00:16.860> say<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.279> has

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
is that some people will say that it has

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
is that some people will say that it has
this<00:00:17.610> part<00:00:17.910> right<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.090> which<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> called<00:00:18.689> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
this part right here which is called a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.710 
this part right here which is called a
switch<00:00:19.430> that<00:00:20.430> might<00:00:20.610> come<00:00:20.820> into<00:00:20.970> play<00:00:21.060> if<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
switch that might come into play if it's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.930 
switch that might come into play if it's
block<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.140> something<00:00:22.349> and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> pull

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
block or something and then on the pull

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.779 
block or something and then on the pull
back<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.990> cut<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.500> forearm<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.430> hand<00:00:26.610> or

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
back it can cut a forearm or hand or

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.750 
back it can cut a forearm or hand or
something<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:28.650> better<00:00:29.520> way<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
something like that a better way to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.490 
something like that a better way to
think<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.810> being<00:00:31.140> able<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
think about this it's being able to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.860 
think about this it's being able to
attack<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.190> push<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> pull<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
attack on the push and on the pull and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.689 
attack on the push and on the pull and
the<00:00:34.500> thing<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.800> allows<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.640> on

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
the thing that allows you to do that on

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.490 
the thing that allows you to do that on
this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> length<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> knife<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> also

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
this is the length of the knife and also

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400 
this is the length of the knife and also
a<00:00:37.760> little<00:00:38.760> bit<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> downward<00:00:39.420> curve<00:00:40.020> here

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
a little bit of a downward curve here

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.850 
a little bit of a downward curve here
that's<00:00:40.800> called<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.160> belly<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:43.559> you'll<00:00:43.710> also

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that's called a belly and you'll also

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.340 
that's called a belly and you'll also
see<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.940> different<00:00:45.570> types<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.110> knives<00:00:48.350> such

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
see it on different types of knives such

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
see it on different types of knives such
as<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
as this one and it's going to be a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.139 
as this one and it's going to be a
pushing<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:53.040> pulling<00:00:53.430> motion<00:00:53.460> most<00:00:53.910> people

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
pushing and a pulling motion most people

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.790 
pushing and a pulling motion most people
though<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.450> attack<00:00:54.540> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> pulling<00:00:55.530> part

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
though the attack on the pulling part

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.930 
though the attack on the pulling part
meaning<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.920> hit<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:01:01.940> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
meaning that they will hit and then and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.090 
meaning that they will hit and then and
the<00:01:03.480> motion<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.410> to<00:01:04.440> here<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.979> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the motion is from here to here so we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670 
the motion is from here to here so we
can<00:01:05.250> measure<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.550> blade<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.720> several

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
can measure the blade and it's several

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
can measure the blade and it's several
inches<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.550> if<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.630> attack<00:01:10.050> on<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
inches like this if we attack on the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
inches like this if we attack on the
push<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> fold<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:11.970> coming<00:01:12.240> in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
push and on the fold and I'm coming in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.010 
push and on the fold and I'm coming in
actually<00:01:12.899> like<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.440> it's<00:01:14.310> pushing<00:01:14.789> and<00:01:15.240> then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
actually like this it's pushing and then

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.469 
actually like this it's pushing and then
it's<00:01:16.229> pulling<00:01:16.679> back<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> length<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.179> it<00:01:18.330> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it's pulling back so the length of it is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's pulling back so the length of it is
actually<00:01:18.959> pushing<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.800> several<00:01:20.130> inches<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
actually pushing here several inches and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
actually pushing here several inches and
then<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:21.929> from<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.679> hand

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
then all the way from right by your hand

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.639 
then all the way from right by your hand
all<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> way<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.209> several<00:01:24.630> inches<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
all the way back several inches so it

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.139 
all the way back several inches so it
should<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.860> over<00:01:26.190> twice<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.490> length<00:01:26.819> of<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
should be over twice the length of the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.699 
should be over twice the length of the
cut<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> motion<00:01:28.410> is<00:01:33.289> this<00:01:34.289> one<00:01:34.470> isn't

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
cut so the motion is this one isn't

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:35.960 
cut so the motion is this one isn't
going<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.890> make<00:01:35.009> use<00:01:35.160> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.399> momentum<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.940> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
going to make use of the momentum as it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.330 
going to make use of the momentum as it
would<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.660> to<00:01:36.810> just

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
would if I was to just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.060 
would if I was to just
and<00:01:37.429> chopped<00:01:38.420> or<00:01:38.600> something<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.890> can

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
and chopped or something but it can

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.730 
and chopped or something but it can
actually<00:01:40.429> go<00:01:40.549> through<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.820> lot<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.090> material

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
actually go through a lot of material

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.109 
actually go through a lot of material
going<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.039> way<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.429> has<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.579> lot<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.880> that

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
going this way so it has a lot of that

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.929 
going this way so it has a lot of that
edge<00:01:44.380> coming<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.799> out<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.460> one<00:01:46.670> can<00:01:46.819> be

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
edge coming in and out this one can be

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.660 
edge coming in and out this one can be
done<00:01:47.119> also<00:01:47.509> along<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.960> various<00:01:48.259> angles<00:01:48.829> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
done also along the various angles that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.639 
done also along the various angles that
she<00:01:49.819> might<00:01:50.000> attack<00:01:50.329> with<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.319> ones<00:01:51.469> I<00:01:51.590> think

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
she might attack with the ones I think

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.859 
she might attack with the ones I think
about<00:01:52.030> generally<00:01:53.030> will<00:01:53.179> be<00:01:53.299> horizontal<00:01:53.709> here

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
about generally will be horizontal here

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:04.660 
about generally will be horizontal here
the<00:01:56.869> vertically<00:01:58.119> downward<00:02:01.359> or<00:02:03.490> vertical<00:02:04.490> this

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the vertically downward or vertical this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.730 
the vertically downward or vertical this
way<00:02:04.939> this<00:02:05.569> one<00:02:05.780> would<00:02:05.959> be<00:02:05.990> against<00:02:06.469> a

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
way this one would be against a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.710 
way this one would be against a
horizontal<00:02:07.490> target<00:02:07.819> something<00:02:08.000> like<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:08.269> forum

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
horizontal target something like a forum
