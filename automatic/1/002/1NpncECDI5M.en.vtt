the<00:00:32.790> most<00:00:33.149> child-friendly<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.860> no

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the most child-friendly there are no

bright colors here or things to engage

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
bright colors here or things to engage
with<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> hope<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.790> app<00:00:39.000> can

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
with so the hope is that this app can

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
with so the hope is that this app can
change<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.870> by<00:00:40.350> giving<00:00:40.469> children<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.070> fun<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
change that by giving children a fun and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.209 
change that by giving children a fun and
slightly<00:00:42.180> competitive<00:00:42.840> way<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.920> learn<00:00:44.070> about

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
slightly competitive way to learn about

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670 
slightly competitive way to learn about
these<00:00:44.489> sculptures<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.989> game<00:00:46.200> we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
these sculptures so in this game we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
these sculptures so in this game we
simply<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> match<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.940> silhouette<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
simply have to match the silhouette to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.069 
simply have to match the silhouette to
the<00:00:49.309> correct<00:00:50.309> sculpture<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the correct sculpture so this is one of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
the correct sculpture so this is one of
a<00:00:52.230> number<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.710> games<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.309> challenges<00:00:53.879> which

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a number of games and challenges which

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.900 
a number of games and challenges which
guide<00:00:54.480> children<00:00:54.780> around<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> exhibition<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
guide children around the exhibition and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
guide children around the exhibition and
we<00:00:57.030> simply<00:00:57.270> walk<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.620> point<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
we simply walk up how we point the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.160 
we simply walk up how we point the
device<00:00:59.129> T<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> sculpture<00:01:00.329> comes<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
device T and that sculpture comes to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.490 
device T and that sculpture comes to
life<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.180> tap<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.199> then

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
life and if we tap just like that then

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
life and if we tap just like that then
we<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:04.920> information<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> minute<00:01:06.270> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
we get some information at the minute we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.880 
we get some information at the minute we
have<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> details<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> sculptures<00:01:07.740> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
have the details on the sculptures but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.490 
have the details on the sculptures but
it's<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.130> adult<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.600> orientate<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.110> with

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's very adult at all orientate it with

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's very adult at all orientate it with
this<00:01:10.650> game<00:01:10.890> we've<00:01:11.400> created<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.090> child-friendly

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this game we've created a child-friendly

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.620 
this game we've created a child-friendly
version<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> text<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.299> obviously<00:01:15.299> with

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
version of that text and obviously with

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
version of that text and obviously with
a<00:01:15.659> game<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:17.100> children<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.520> more

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a game now I think children are more

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.760 
a game now I think children are more
inclined<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> play<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.170> observe<00:01:19.439> what

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
inclined to play and to observe what

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.170 
inclined to play and to observe what
they're<00:01:19.890> looking<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> learn<00:01:20.729> about<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
they're looking at and to learn about it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.539 
they're looking at and to learn about it
than<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> sculptures<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
than if it's just the sculptures and the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.950 
than if it's just the sculptures and the
normal<00:01:23.880> museum<00:01:24.210> growing<00:01:24.420> environment<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
normal museum growing environment that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.100 
normal museum growing environment that
they've<00:01:25.080> had<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> past<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:26.189> use<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
they've had in the past we use the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.670 
they've had in the past we use the
technology<00:01:28.110> they're<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.439> comfortable

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
technology they're really comfortable

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.050 
technology they're really comfortable
with<00:01:29.009> there's<00:01:29.220> interactions<00:01:29.700> they're<00:01:29.880> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
with there's interactions they're really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.249 
with there's interactions they're really
familiar<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.570> you're<00:01:30.600> exciting<00:01:31.140> and

learning about at the same time but

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.319 
learning about at the same time but
could<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.710> soon<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.579> than<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.180> way

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
could this soon be more than just a way

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.960 
could this soon be more than just a way

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
behind this want to use their technology
