00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it's obviously sounds a little bit

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.819

better than that but we had a sound that
was<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.550> bit<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.649> what<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> call<00:00:47.220> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
was a little bit more of what I call the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
was a little bit more of what I call the
swirly<00:00:48.090> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> sound<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
swirly kind of sound when I was

something<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.610> Dimebag<00:02:00.030> Darrell<00:02:00.179> also

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
something that like Dimebag Darrell also

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.910 
something that like Dimebag Darrell also
was<00:02:00.660> not<00:02:00.840> famous<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.140> doing<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.709> dave

was not famous for doing and dave
incorporated<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.179> then<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.929> was

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
incorporated as well and then there was

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.680 
incorporated as well and then there was
a<00:02:04.080> bit<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.410> just<00:02:05.160> modulation<00:02:05.700> effect<00:02:06.330> just<00:02:06.569> to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
a bit of just modulation effect just to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.229 
a bit of just modulation effect just to
add<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:07.830> as<00:02:08.069> Dave<00:02:08.429> said<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
add to a little bit as Dave said the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
add to a little bit as Dave said the
kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> swirling<00:02:09.899> effect<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.500> add<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
kind of swirling effect just add a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800 
kind of swirling effect just add a
little<00:02:11.310> bit<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.640> movement<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> sound<00:02:12.540> loop

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
little bit of movement to the sound loop

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.330 
little bit of movement to the sound loop
to<00:02:12.959> spread<00:02:14.420> as<00:02:15.920> chorusing<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.099> flange

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to spread as chorusing and flange

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.770 
to spread as chorusing and flange
effects<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:18.000> became<00:02:18.270> popular<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
effects like that became popular in the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.610 
effects like that became popular in the
80's<00:02:19.050> 90's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
80's 90's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.830 
80's 90's
those<00:02:19.920> are<00:02:20.129> corporated<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.790> done<00:02:21.629> in<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
those are corporated and done in a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.180 
those are corporated and done in a
magnetic<00:02:22.140> em<00:02:22.379> style

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
magnetic em style

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.320 
magnetic em style
so<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.430> what<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.940> sound<00:02:25.090> like

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
so this is what it's going to sound like

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.210 
so this is what it's going to sound like
when<00:02:25.599> Margaret<00:02:25.900> played<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> course<00:02:26.770> two

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
when Margaret played the course two

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.930 
when Margaret played the course two
simple<00:02:27.819> destruction<00:02:28.330> with<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.690> patch
