00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.290
 everyone knows what the Asters 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.750
 Abel appeared a few years ago 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.830
 come on 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.680
 different bodywork i want bei sedan and even 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.890
 three-door bit and chips but maybe 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.310
 someone saw a little of these versions leave 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.080
 l'extrait with suspension flags Wright what is it 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.930
 so here we are now see just me 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.170
 food on sedan and az-3 with flash package 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.000
 a site that costs more than 40 thousand rubles 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.969
 and offered up to the maximum 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.739
 complete cosmo 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.899
 on the panel we sometimes hand console 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.020
 there are two buttons 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.290
 this is a sport button 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.920
 It does not help now 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.100
 one of them is not activated 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 that is, the drivers to feel here 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.180
 this one is a bullshit 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.810
 must press one of these buttons if 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.259
 I'll press a button 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.259
 cake 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.619
 will fit 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.780
 little light like this here will not nothing 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.400
 happen i will say why here should 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.320
 be very much later so here's the car 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.930
 it becomes somewhat more comfortable 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.299
 kennel saved with sports but the way 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 there is such a hint of buildup 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.460
 it seems especially when such 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.790
 longitudinal cracks are many and asphalt 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 not low that bad but this is not a week 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.100
 science steering becomes a little softer 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.240
 relatively speaking, if you press a button 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.430
 sport that is, the differences are already more 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
 essential here immediately begins on 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 the fifth point of our my passengers 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.050
 such sensations are more transmitted by micro 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.500
 road profile that is between 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.580
 tires conditionally telling them march but frame 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.490
 shock absorbers change so it starts 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 transfer to the cars so tiny 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.269
 vibrations and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.640
 it feels like the car has changed 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.460
 whether the towers and either 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.890
 other shock absorbers put in she 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.950
 it gets a little tougher and lights up here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.190
 on the dashboard, the game said why 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.250
 such a red light 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.590
 which kind of urge the driver yes 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.140
 but the most interesting and most comfortable on 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.820
 my mind because dad and money on 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.410
 here help us in sharp turns on 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.300
 normality is a kind of critical 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.850
 there it is unsaturated it is not allowed 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.740
 changing then I'm not machine dependent click 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.960
 button but here changing dramatically 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.100
 very much 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.640
 acceleration and feed so how to say 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.560
 torques 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.110
 so to speak on the pedal 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.150
 accelerator already at the slightest click 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.850
 acceleration begins here in this class 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.950
 that is, when you want me for example 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.960
 go to quite quickly in a city or 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.000
 on the track this sport mode is just 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.490
 excellent stuff plus more so 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.640
 a great effort steering while holding the button 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.000
 sport is harder 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.200
 these are such ears 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.200
 only erases we get
