year<00:02:00.630> take<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> look

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.809 

so<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.019> see<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> cutter<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.920> bowl<00:02:21.250> they're

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
so you see the cutter is a bowl they're

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.030 
so you see the cutter is a bowl they're
bright<00:02:22.330> they<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:23.050> bring<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.650> out<00:02:23.800> at<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
bright they just bring you out at the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.420 
bright they just bring you out at the
winter<00:02:24.310> time<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:26.140> easy<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.800> tell<00:02:27.010> spring

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
winter time and it's easy to tell spring

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.949 
winter time and it's easy to tell spring
covers<00:02:27.819> because<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.330> just<00:02:28.510> look<00:02:28.750> at<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
covers because you just look at the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.620 
covers because you just look at the
flowers<00:02:29.280> look<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.459> what's<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.150> look<00:02:31.540> at

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
flowers look at what's going on look at

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.380 
flowers look at what's going on look at
the<00:02:31.720> things<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.500> bloom<00:02:32.769> always<00:02:33.730> bold<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
the things that bloom always bold and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.979 
the things that bloom always bold and
bright

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
bright

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.490 
bright
so<00:02:35.380> usually<00:02:36.040> spring<00:02:37.000> colors<00:02:37.390> are<00:02:37.569> like<00:02:38.170> that

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.710 
now our general rule of thumb is if you
can<00:04:42.800> wear<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.980> gold<00:04:43.280> jury<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.270> makes<00:04:44.510> you

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
can wear a gold jury and it makes you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.990 
can wear a gold jury and it makes you
shine<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.010> people<00:04:46.580> just<00:04:46.760> tell<00:04:46.910> you

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
shine and and and people just tell you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.070 
shine and and and people just tell you
how<00:04:47.120> great<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.510> looks<00:04:47.540> on<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:47.990> the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
how great it looks on you and the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.580 
how great it looks on you and the
chances<00:04:48.710> are<00:04:48.860> you're<00:04:49.730> in<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.270> warm<00:04:50.660> color

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
chances are you're in the warm color

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.040 
chances are you're in the warm color
shades<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.760> means<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.210> like<00:04:53.420> bright<00:04:54.020> colors
