00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.620 
created and as soon as you put it on
take<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> bowl<00:01:08.520> bigger<00:01:08.939> than<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> breads<00:01:09.450> gonna

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
take a bowl bigger than the breads gonna

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.480 
take a bowl bigger than the breads gonna
be<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.049> done<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.290> cover<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> loaf

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.300 

close<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.729> oven<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.770> with<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.979> hearth

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
close your oven and with that hearth

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.719 
close your oven and with that hearth
preheated<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.409> 475<00:01:25.409> degrees<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
preheated to 475 degrees and that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
preheated to 475 degrees and that
covering<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.170> bread<00:01:28.439> immediately

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
covering on it the bread immediately

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
covering on it the bread immediately
starts<00:01:29.220> giving<00:01:29.430> off<00:01:29.670> moisture<00:01:29.960> because

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
starts giving off moisture because

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.300 
starts giving off moisture because
that's<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.320> happens<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> water<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that's what happens to water when it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
that's what happens to water when it
gets<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.579> 400<00:01:33.150> degrees<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
gets it 400 degrees and that but that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.240 
gets it 400 degrees and that but that
steam<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.640> contained<00:01:36.390> within<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.840> bowl<00:01:37.250> so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
steam is contained within the bowl so

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.300 
steam is contained within the bowl so
the<00:01:38.280> crust<00:01:39.060> stays<00:01:39.299> soft<00:01:40.040> until<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> rises

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the crust stays soft until it rises

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.880 
the crust stays soft until it rises
completely<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> what<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.740> looking

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
completely which is what you're looking

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.760 
completely which is what you're looking
for<00:01:44.220> by<00:01:44.399> spritzing<00:01:44.700> water<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> oven<00:01:45.869> but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
for by spritzing water in the oven but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
for by spritzing water in the oven but
this<00:01:46.920> does<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.430> more<00:01:47.670> thorough<00:01:47.909> job<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this does a much more thorough job and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
this does a much more thorough job and
then<00:01:48.600> after<00:01:48.840> 15<00:01:49.259> minutes<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.649> take<00:01:49.829> off<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
then after 15 minutes you take off the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.060 
then after 15 minutes you take off the
cover<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.700> bake<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> until<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.380> beautiful

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
cover and bake it until it's a beautiful

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.899 
cover and bake it until it's a beautiful
golden<00:01:53.369> brown<00:01:53.899> but<00:01:54.899> you've<00:01:55.049> got<00:01:55.200> great<00:01:55.500> crust

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
golden brown but you've got great crust

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.800 
golden brown but you've got great crust
essentially<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> same<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.659> you'd

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
essentially the same thing that you'd

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
essentially the same thing that you'd
get<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> went<00:01:58.320> down<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> wheat<00:01:58.799> fields<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
get if you went down to wheat fields and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
get if you went down to wheat fields and
bought<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> loaf<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> bread<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:01.350> long<00:02:01.590> you've

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
bought a loaf of bread as long you've

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.560 
bought a loaf of bread as long you've
done<00:02:01.950> everything<00:02:02.399> else<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.090> the
