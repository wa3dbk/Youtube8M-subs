being<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.480> material<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.379> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
being this this material that just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
being this this material that just
seemed<00:00:52.800> natural<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> steel<00:00:53.899> whether

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
seemed natural for the steel whether

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.439 
seemed natural for the steel whether
that<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.469> rusted<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.399> otherwise<00:00:56.969> treated

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that kind of movement in a piece of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.700 
that kind of movement in a piece of
something<00:01:11.549> that's<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.260> hard<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> so

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
something that's so hard and so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the leaves their indicators of life I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
the leaves their indicators of life I

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
them I've loved them when i first

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.459 
them I've loved them when i first
started<00:01:44.759> welding<00:01:44.969> i<00:01:45.240> started<00:01:45.719> casting<00:01:45.960> birds

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
started welding i started casting birds

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.440 
started welding i started casting birds
and<00:01:46.770> putting<00:01:47.219> them<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.580> my<00:01:47.880> sculptures

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and putting them on my sculptures

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.639 
and putting them on my sculptures
because<00:01:49.049> i<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.099> birds<00:01:50.429> with<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.759> steal

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
because i like the birds with the steal

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.710 
because i like the birds with the steal
the<00:01:52.649> sculptures<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.429> go<00:01:53.640> outside<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the sculptures that go outside and the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.449 
the sculptures that go outside and the
birds<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:55.049> always<00:01:55.289> on<00:01:55.439> them<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> figured

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
birds are always on them so I figured

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.999 
birds are always on them so I figured

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
like they're moving in the garden give

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900 
like they're moving in the garden give
that<00:02:18.690> suggestion<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.410> where<00:02:19.709> she's<00:02:20.310> looking
