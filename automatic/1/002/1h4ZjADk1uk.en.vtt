00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.339 
editions I do believe that this game
pack<00:00:21.430> contains<00:00:21.789> about<00:00:22.029> 32<00:00:22.570> different<00:00:22.960> skins<00:00:23.170> I

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.839 
pack contains about 32 different skins I
could<00:00:23.590> be<00:00:23.679> wrong<00:00:23.859> I'll<00:00:24.279> probably<00:00:24.580> have<00:00:24.820> the

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
could be wrong I'll probably have the

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.759 
could be wrong I'll probably have the
exact<00:00:25.330> number<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:25.750> new<00:00:25.869> skins<00:00:26.170> either<00:00:26.439> in<00:00:26.650> the

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
exact number of new skins either in the

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.710 
exact number of new skins either in the
title<00:00:27.189> or<00:00:27.550> in<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.759> description<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.480> this

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.779 
video
so<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.650> way<00:00:29.769> I'm<00:00:29.890> probably<00:00:30.099> going<00:00:30.339> to<00:00:30.460> do<00:00:30.670> this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
so the way I'm probably going to do this

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.940 
so the way I'm probably going to do this
is<00:00:31.000> by<00:00:31.179> rotating<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.839> skin<00:00:32.080> a<00:00:32.230> few<00:00:32.410> times<00:00:32.710> and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
is by rotating the skin a few times and

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.350 
is by rotating the skin a few times and
attempting<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.579> say<00:00:33.730> their<00:00:33.910> name<00:00:34.059> so<00:00:34.270> the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
attempting to say their name so the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.180 
attempting to say their name so the
first<00:00:34.570> person<00:00:34.899> we<00:00:35.020> have<00:00:35.200> is<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:35.620> kiddies<00:00:36.010> em

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
first person we have is that kiddies em

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.490 
first person we have is that kiddies em
so<00:00:36.730> I'll<00:00:36.879> rotate<00:00:37.239> him<00:00:37.480> he's<00:00:37.809> pretty<00:00:38.110> cool<00:00:38.289> I

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
so I'll rotate him he's pretty cool I

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.959 
so I'll rotate him he's pretty cool I
realized<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.070> skin<00:00:39.309> this<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.610> skin<00:00:39.760> I'm

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
realized the skin this is the skin I'm

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.639 
realized the skin this is the skin I'm
currently<00:00:40.239> wearing<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.930> then<00:00:41.260> we<00:00:41.410> have
