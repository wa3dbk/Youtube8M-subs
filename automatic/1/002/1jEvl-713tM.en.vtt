and<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:53.420> built<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:54.790> device<00:01:55.790> here<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.300> go<00:01:56.390> ahead

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
and I built a device here to go ahead

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.110 
and I built a device here to go ahead
and<00:01:56.630> put<00:01:56.780> me<00:01:56.930> in<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.380> tank<00:01:57.650> so<00:01:58.160> I<00:01:58.220> can<00:01:58.460> dump<00:01:58.940> the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
and put me in the tank so I can dump the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.690 
and put me in the tank so I can dump the

fine<00:03:05.889> very<00:03:06.889> done<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.280> brake<00:03:07.730> lines<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.470> started

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
fine very done the brake lines I started

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.199 
fine very done the brake lines I started
from<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.709> back<00:03:09.889> here<00:03:10.159> where<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.670> Dooleys<00:03:11.000> are

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.960 
from the back here where the Dooleys are
and<00:03:11.900> everything<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.709> ran<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> new<00:03:13.250> line<00:03:13.519> all

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
and everything and I ran a new line all

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.780 
and everything and I ran a new line all
the<00:03:14.000> way<00:03:14.150> up<00:03:14.389> to<00:03:14.689> the<00:03:15.169> front<00:03:15.680> new<00:03:16.340> brake<00:03:16.549> line

the way up to the front new brake line

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.069 
the way up to the front new brake line
so<00:03:17.000> not<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.239> worry<00:03:17.269> about<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.540> because<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.930> had

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079
