so<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.890> next<00:00:01.920> question<00:00:02.159> comes<00:00:02.490> in<00:00:02.909> from<00:00:02.939> this

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
so the next question comes in from this

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.210 
so the next question comes in from this
guy<00:00:03.389> named<00:00:03.629> Jim<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.110> Jim<00:00:04.350> wants<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.859> know<00:00:04.980> i'm

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
guy named Jim and Jim wants to know i'm

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.400 
guy named Jim and Jim wants to know i'm
thinking<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:06.210> getting<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.899> gaming<00:00:07.259> computer

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
thinking of getting a gaming computer

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.129 
thinking of getting a gaming computer
and<00:00:07.859> i'm<00:00:08.160> confused<00:00:08.670> between<00:00:08.880> dual<00:00:09.360> core<00:00:09.719> quad

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
and i'm confused between dual core quad

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.129 
and i'm confused between dual core quad
core<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.800> six<00:00:11.550> core<00:00:11.880> processors<00:00:12.540> which<00:00:12.870> one's

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
core and six core processors which one's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.550 
core and six core processors which one's
better<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:14.040> should<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.309> get<00:00:14.370> well<00:00:15.330> Jim<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
better and what should I get well Jim it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.320 
better and what should I get well Jim it
really<00:00:17.220> depends<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.940> want<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.210> do

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
really depends on what you want to do

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.150 
really depends on what you want to do
and<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> those<00:00:19.230> things<00:00:19.470> where<00:00:19.650> if

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and this is one of those things where if

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.830 
and this is one of those things where if
you<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> spend<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> money<00:00:21.570> and

on a quad core processor in fact they
rarely<00:00:37.260> even<00:00:37.620> use<00:00:38.010> both<00:00:38.399> cores<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> dual

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.330 
core processor video games nowadays
actually<00:00:42.120> rely<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.500> graphics<00:00:44.010> card

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
actually rely more on the graphics card

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
actually rely more on the graphics card
than<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.420> CPU<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
than they do the CPU which is kind of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
than they do the CPU which is kind of
unfortunate<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.910> means<00:00:48.149> AI<00:00:48.750> basically

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
unfortunate which means AI basically

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.660 
unfortunate which means AI basically
isn't<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.950> doing<00:00:50.100> anything<00:00:50.430> they're<00:00:50.640> just

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
isn't really doing anything they're just

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.750 
isn't really doing anything they're just
running<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.600> basic<00:00:52.020> scripts<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:53.070> said<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
running very basic scripts it said I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
running very basic scripts it said I
know<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> future<00:00:54.690> you'll<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.260> more

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
know but in the future you'll see more

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
know but in the future you'll see more
processing<00:00:56.100> power<00:00:56.129> needed<00:00:56.670> by<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:56.940> video

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
processing power needed by these video

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
processing power needed by these video
games<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:58.559> why<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.890> would<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> six

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
games and that's why you would get a six

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.549 
games and that's why you would get a six

not<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.190> games<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.640> utilize

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
not going to see games you utilize

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.630 
not going to see games you utilize
multithreading<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:03.989> much<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.500> should

with a fork or right now a quad core
it's<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> best<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.509> both<00:01:24.630> worlds<00:01:25.080> you'll

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's the best of both worlds you'll

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's the best of both worlds you'll
still<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.530> able<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> use<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> year<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.520> now

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
still be able to use it a year from now

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
still be able to use it a year from now
and<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:27.840> time<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.259> you'll<00:01:28.350> still

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740 
like I do get yourself a six core
processor<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> quad<00:01:39.240> core<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.689> now

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
processor I have a quad core right now

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.499 
processor I have a quad core right now
and<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.799> cannot<00:01:41.100> wait<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> upgrade<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.180> six

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and I cannot wait to upgrade to a six

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
and I cannot wait to upgrade to a six
core<00:01:42.689> processor<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.860> quite

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
core processor because well quite

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.160 
core processor because well quite
frankly<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.210> would<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.450> video<00:01:45.689> editing<00:01:46.020> go

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
frankly it would make video editing go

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
frankly it would make video editing go
off<00:01:46.380> thousand<00:01:47.040> times<00:01:47.250> faster<00:01:47.479> well<00:01:48.479> would

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
off thousand times faster well would

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
off thousand times faster well would
make<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> rendering<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.590> faster<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.310> now

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
make the rendering go faster right now

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
make the rendering go faster right now
it<00:01:50.520> takes<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> video<00:01:51.540> series<00:01:51.720> called

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it takes I have a video series called

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
it takes I have a video series called
until<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.380> win<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:53.159> now<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> takes

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
until we win and right now it takes

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
until we win and right now it takes
about<00:01:53.790> 20<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> 25<00:01:54.689> minutes<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.170> render<00:01:55.530> those

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
about 20 to 25 minutes to render those

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.249 
about 20 to 25 minutes to render those
videos<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> 6-quart<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.960> going

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

more cores having faster cores it's all
graded<00:02:44.829> basically<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.459> means<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.810> do

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019

go<00:02:52.510> insane<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.900> mean<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.230> your<00:02:53.349> budget<00:02:53.560> calls

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
go insane I mean if your budget calls

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.339 
go insane I mean if your budget calls
for<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.549> modest<00:02:55.209> gaming<00:02:55.599> computer<00:02:55.930> then<00:02:56.109> then

for a modest gaming computer then then

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.229 
for a modest gaming computer then then
don't<00:02:56.590> go<00:02:56.680> insane<00:02:57.010> buying<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.700> processor

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
don't go insane buying the processor

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.729 
don't go insane buying the processor
believe<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.230> would<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.349> better<00:02:59.650> off

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
believe me you would be better off

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.559 
believe me you would be better off
spending<00:03:00.099> your<00:03:00.370> money<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:00.940> RAM<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
spending your money on the RAM and the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.270 
spending your money on the RAM and the
memory<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.440> would<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.799> processor

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
memory that you would the processor

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.430 
memory that you would the processor
speed<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:04.780> what's<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.049> difference<00:03:05.200> between

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
speed but what's the difference between

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.400 
speed but what's the difference between
four<00:03:05.980> cores<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.519> six<00:03:06.819> cores<00:03:07.090> only<00:03:07.930> two<00:03:08.109> cores

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
four cores and six cores only two cores

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.119 
four cores and six cores only two cores
it's<00:03:09.310> not<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> lot<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.480> if<00:03:11.109> it's<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.799> lot<00:03:11.950> more

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
it's not a lot so if it's a lot more

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.079 
it's not a lot so if it's a lot more
money<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.780> spend<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> right
