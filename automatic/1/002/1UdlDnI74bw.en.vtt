have<00:02:33.890> been<00:02:34.099> trying<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.550> figure<00:02:34.700> out<00:02:34.849> what<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
have been trying to figure out what the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.449 
have been trying to figure out what the
heck<00:02:35.750> sort<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.230> tail<00:02:36.440> into<00:02:36.650> tiara<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.030 
heck sort of tail into tiara and the
silver<00:02:37.819> spoon<00:02:38.000> could<00:02:38.300> represent<00:02:38.480> since<00:02:39.050> 2010

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.160 
silver spoon could represent since 2010
and<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.700> closest<00:02:41.120> I've<00:02:41.269> come<00:02:41.300> is<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> tiara

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and the closest I've come is a tiara

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.160 
and the closest I've come is a tiara
maybe<00:02:42.580> representing<00:02:43.580> pageantry<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.510> even<00:02:45.050> if

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
maybe representing pageantry and even if

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.050 
maybe representing pageantry and even if
that<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.680> case<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.280> takes<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.760> lot<00:02:47.030> more

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
