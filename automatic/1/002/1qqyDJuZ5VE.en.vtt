00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.490
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.760
 I will show you how 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:18.189
 to run the vcs codes of using are you 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 impro 09 or some other turbo 5 in this 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.080
 case an iphone 4s sprint 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.619
 here we see that it appears as it is 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.210
 blocked with you but I modified a 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.850
 file for that name to appear 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.500
 but that does not desert springs 4 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 It is released with the racing for nessed 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.070
 honduras here we are going to try then 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.070
 check the balance 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.079
 and how do you see the balance has it 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:49.000
 perfectly now let's introduce 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.000
 another to buy internet packages 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.870
 and we see that it is indeed 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.310
 working now what I did was what 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.980
 next we go to Syria 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.470
 and we add the changes repository 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.140
 now 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.070
 in this repository there is a pack that is 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.440
 him with center patch for it 7 this what 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.770
 what it does is that it will authenticate us 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.219
 all the changes we make 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.899
 in the repository or forgiveness in the system 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.750
 of files that spring puts by default 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.520
 since if we do not have it installed it 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.310
 will erase the entire folder and the iphone will not 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.700
 will look for signal and will work for what 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.799
 it will have to be restored 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.659
 you also have to have iframe installed 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.659
 that you can find for free 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590
 and I have it 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.110
 what we are going to do is go to the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.980
 user folder 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.980
 library 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.210
 lane default dot point 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.049
 and we look for a file called load 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.049
 to the point phillips 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.680
 we see the properties and we go to the 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.689
 last option that says support 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.880
 supplementary services we activate it to 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.530
 you're going to seem subdued and then 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.519
 we restart the iphone and we will have the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.519
 usb codes
