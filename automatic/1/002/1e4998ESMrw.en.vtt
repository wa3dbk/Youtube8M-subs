00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.070
 do not 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.919
 Hello again 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.919
 today I want to share with you 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.090
 a lesson that I learned no casual way being quite young 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.579
 the concept is very simple 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.579
 you have neglected that your own happiness 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.539
 to generate happiness 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 around to make it easier to help make others happy 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.460
 You have to be strong and live happy so that some of those strengths and joy 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.900
 infect others 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.740
 the incident that led me to this conclusion 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.630
 I would have some 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.630
 20 years back then 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.890
 I was living in Madrid trying to find my life like this act 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.660
 and wrote a lot 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.660
 I always had a diary with me and as soon as an idea occurred to him 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.220
 for boada when he was still writing and so one afternoon walking around 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.990
 the neighborhood of LavapiÃ©s 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.289
 He passed by a street that 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.310
 empty quiet 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.440
 I think an idea is growing in a portal shakur notebook if I get to 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.290
 to write 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.880
 and I do not remember what to write about but what I remember is that he spent it 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.560
 properly because I would laugh myself 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350
 after a couple of hours 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.120
 begin to happen in the light 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.520
 to describe raised the head and the atmosphere of the street arias changed by 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.850
 full 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.360
 now it was full of people there was a very good roll a lot of march there was a bar a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.380
 little further down than I had even found out that I was involved was 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.440
 full of people 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.390
 people had taken the due to the street someone had believed music 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.810
 finally Juan Royo and I thought mod and this change 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.710
 because it is the time of the walk 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.710
 and that will be the neighborhood youth bar 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.100
 why and cables 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.929
 for something else maybe I have contributed to this good vibes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.999
 because anyone who has passed by here and has seen me writing and 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.539
 laughing 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.419
 Well it only improves thinking here is crazy 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.219
 or maybe he has thought what good vibes he has, I am going to enter this valley and 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 Take a beer and so good vibes 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.180
 could have been spreading horns that seemed now that the street was 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.369
 verbena 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:37.039
 like when you go to a concert here is a crazy thing to do the ari started 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.409
 they join two or three 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.270
 and everyone ends up dancing 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.439
 there is always a 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.370
 act 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.690
 and create a stream a first installment 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.529
 in the storm 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.099
 this conclusion 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.539
 of which you have to be happy 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:01.069
 to create happiness the runner may not have been removed at that time 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.069
 but then with the years 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.449
 I have it checked for example now eta work 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.590
 replacement teacher entered all kinds of businesses and even more 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.339
 and I have verified that 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.659
 the face and the spirit with which he entered ends now 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:22.619
 mark the pattern of the entire class will affect each of the tributaries the 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.670
 25 students that the mayor does not imply a job 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.670
 with better face and my best spirit 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.329
 there is a fairly popular current around what they call the law of 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.429
 attraction 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:39.759
 What is it 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.759
 it's basically a bit like karma 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.359
 comes to say that the universe is constantly providing t with the same 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.739
 type of energy that you emit 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.239
 so that 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.629
 if you believe in problems and think problems that have problems and think 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.629
 in good things p good things come 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.349
 as it is not as simple as that he is going to fulfill everything you want because 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.350
 if it were so 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.689
 Well, we would all get a lottery 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.079
 another soccer team 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.699
 favorite by the tide always 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.799
 but I do believe in the law of attraction, I do believe that 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.289
 you receive what you will 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.490
 and the more recent lower 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.460
 in a couple relationship for example to me it seems to me that this is the case 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.370
 never the easiest 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.590
 The more grateful you show yourself, the more pleasant surprises that fall 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.529
 and in general life 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.529
 the smiles receives smiles 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.340
 you treat people with respect 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.189
 people respect you 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:52.650
 Oct

 sow crops 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.659
 Jack 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.330
