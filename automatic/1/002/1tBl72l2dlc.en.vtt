00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 something yesterday thursday my friend gave me a 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.880
 creepy pasta that happened 1 year ago but 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.800
 Only by letter did I like the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.380
 story that I made a title and a good 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.799
 creepy pasta so we started this 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.450
 creepy pasta that is titled the xbox360 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.600
 damn but before I wanted to tell you something 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.240
 if this creepy in good visits maybe 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 there's more but let's start this at once 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.560
 fuck 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.330
 fuck fuck 4 and fuck how is it that my 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.400
 own ambition would take me to that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.700
 nightmare everything started one day I saw 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.190
 xbox 360 offers because I was bored 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.500
 a lot of my old ps2 I searched and searched 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.240
 until I found an offer that said 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.120
 he left only 500 dollars 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 I had 600 when I want to buy it 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.570
 a sign comes out that tells me that if the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.970
 bought would not pay attention to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.250
 consequences to me I did not care and I followed 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.080
 giving him to buy my first mistake when 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.330
 I could see that it was just a 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.780
 white box written in the box said 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.910
 xbox360 marked with bad luck I did not notice 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.620
 a lot on that and I went to plug in the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.780
 plug to my TV and when I'm going to 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.300
 turn on I get the famous red circle 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 of the death of xbox pissed the turn off 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.950
 and I turned it on again after 15 minutes 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.600
 now it has perfectly turned on 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.179
 introduction was the same as always 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.310
 just that the background was red he put me to 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.710
 make my avatar all normal that though 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.990
 with a gloomy background I struggled and when 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.000
 I ended up I got frozen when I saw that 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.950
 it was a voodoo doll from me I got a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.959
 poster that said that this will be my avatar 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.310
 for the xbox and that would do things to him 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.590
 macabre to voodoo 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.569
 I was that or that my avatar was one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.790
 of my family I dared to continue 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.190
 until a game came out of nothing the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.380
 title was torture the voodoo only gave me 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.720
 the option to say that if played between 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.940
 I saw my guru in front of a TV I thought that 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.459
 It was me then someone went to the TV 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.920
 and he started hitting me very hard voodoo 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.170
 I was already very scared my heart did not 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.090
 holding him gave me a heart attack at 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.950
 see that with a knife the only thing 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.170
 I remember later I woke up in the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.269
 hospital only with a few points in my 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.280
 stomach my parents told me that I 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.319
 found on the floor of my room with 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 the xbox catching on fire me 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.400
 were told it was a miracle that no 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.350
 died after that experience never 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.140
 I saw that xbox again and I never went back to 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.360
 buy microsoft stuff never again like this 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.549
 ends my story of fear and blames them 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.819
 I say do not accept anything that you do not know 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.160
 they will not know what awaits them wahaha that 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.290
 it was my friend my good friend that I can not 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.630
 say his name now that I'm not going to 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.299
 say something about this is not good the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.670
