00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.410
 very good people today I bring you a new 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.180
 chapter of chronicles of a cosplay 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.680
 project already south 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.710
 and today I'm going to show a little 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.140
 advances that I have made during these days 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.200
 start uploading enough videos too 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.960
 for since he had them recorded from before 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.730
 and I wanted to give them the cane 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.560
 new here you are seeing the part of the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.840
 part of front of the helmet and its vale 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.970
 as you can see done enough 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.580
 modifications 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.130
 good all angles and all I've 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.950
 reinforced with epoxy putty worth putty 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.230
 epoxy that I used in other videos 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.810
 in fact some brands that after 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.420
 we will paint differently so that 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.780
 with a more realistic look and that's worth 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.130
 then I gave him epoxy putty like you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.950
 I have said on all sides for example 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.450
 here is to unite this part is worth all 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.470
 this part with epoxy putty and that's what 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.860
 I will do later 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.120
 everything else is sanded and the rest is 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.360
 with toilet paper 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.550
 and white tail with the best attack if 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.350
 You have not seen it, because I leave you here 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.930
 the video is good I'll show you 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.480
 how to do a little better the finishing 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.540
 of the helmet is worth here I have the rest of the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.290
 helmet and as you can see fits 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.600
 perfectly everything 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.240
 It's worth all the meetings and that fits 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.030
 pretty good 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.180
 What I did was tape it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.810
 insulator and give putty and while 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.909
 I was drying what cut I let it dry 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.210
 and then I separated it and that's how it fits 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.880
 perfectly valid if you will not have any 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.009
 kind of problem let's use more 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.539
 over polyester that you will have seen in 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.700
 other of my videos but well this what 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.880
 I'm going to record a little bit with better 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.979
 quality and that and then I repeat it again 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.390
 the purchase of leroy merlin vale comes are 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.880
 two components this one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.880
 and this one has to be mixed 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.170
 on a surface that is not very porous 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.540
 to lose the least amount of putty 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.650
 possible 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.620
 once 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.409
 well removed that no type is left 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.950
 of liquid vale let's use a 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.569
 cardboard for the part that slips and we're going 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.129
 to take a little bit you have to go 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.220
 mixing little by little because it dries 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:36.220
 pretty fast you have to have too 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.629
 very clear the parties so it is 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 where are we going to throw what's worth I'm going to 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.310
 start here and here 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.520
 then carefully do not stain anything 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.520
 OK 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.960
 that I have it you see it looks good 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.120
 I'm going to throw 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.000
 a little bit like that, maybe even better 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.300
 it's too much 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.570
 every putty comes in the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.230
 specifications on the pot worth voucher and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.040
 is already mixed then now 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.040
 another spatula 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.760
 We are going to give a little bit of this 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.269
 here 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.420
 we are going to give little by little 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.909
 the angles the east angle makes with 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.430
 the spatula 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.430
 when tightening it is going smooth 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.849
 it's a goop and we drag 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.430
 this is the first layer worth there will be 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.810
 give more 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.810
 more layers after 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.220
 and we would have it 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.280
 It is worth as you see this has already been 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.410
 quite smoother and still has not 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.820
 dried when dry we will leave it and 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.970
 it will be perfect 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.689
 I'm going to wait for it to dry and see if 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.289
 I finish all this part 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.289
 OK 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.430
 well as you can see I already have here the 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.230
 sanding helmet 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.950
 as I said before we have applied 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.770
 more polyester already and I already sanded and 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.660
 I gave him some details with a marker 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.160
 permanent to see what lines are 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.440
 bounded which are straight 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.590
 which is not good to fix a little 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.960
 more and to be seen I have also given 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.300
 more chair over here as you can see 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.460
 the finish right now is pretty 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.240
 better but 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.810
 there are still parts 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.349
 around here there are quite a few parts 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.750
 that the little holes that need to be filled 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.150
 again with another layer of putty worth 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.889
 then we would have to throw again and 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.889
 sand but it's much faster 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.240
 as you can see also then that here 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.240
 an initial layer not everywhere is worth 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.430
 only for some but you can see that 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.680
 It's getting pretty pretty good 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.870
 ok I think it's looking like 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.470
 quite the next one that I'm going to do is going 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.080
 to be here this part I will put a strip 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:39.220
 also how it is worth a hole 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.050
 here in the middle with LEDs because as 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.400
 you can see there is a lot of difference 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.620
 remains is very out in the part of the 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.040
 mask with helmet's chin 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.230
 so that it is something more like 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.870
 I'll put here a strip as it takes 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:59.020
 in the art it's worth in the project art 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.969
 south a strip of leds and this take it out 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.429
 take it out a little bit 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:07.219
 Well, during these days I will finish 

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:09.199
 give all the putty and I will record you a 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:14.149
 tutorial or something of how I've done this 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:17.270
 part is worth and I'll keep putting putty 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:21.380
 for all these holes that still remain 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.880
 cardboard around here a little bit better in 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.639
 some sides is a little cardboard 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.150
 still so 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:32.240
 put all this with putty and I'll put 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:35.419
 to give a lot of putty around here and 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.430
 push it away and leave it well ready and then 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:40.400
 then I will use a tutorial on how to do 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.050
 the chin and how to align all of them 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.740
 these lines are worth to give all 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.759
 Thin thin and straight fine is worth and nothing 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.710
 more see you in the next chapter 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.360
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:54.069
 I liked to give a like and I already 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.069
 you will say in comments until soon
