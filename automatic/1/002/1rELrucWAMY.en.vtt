00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.810 
actually test your memory on your PC or
laptop<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.010> leave<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.609> just

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
laptop and you just leave it you just

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.840 
laptop and you just leave it you just
burn<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> CD<00:00:18.630> put<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.770> boot<00:00:20.400> windows

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
burn it to a CD put it in boot windows

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.240 
burn it to a CD put it in boot windows
to<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.180> CD<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.840> let<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.170> run<00:00:22.410> okay<00:00:23.100> they're

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
to that CD and let it run okay they're

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.950 
to that CD and let it run okay they're
very<00:00:23.430> small<00:00:23.699> programs<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.600> see<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
very small programs as you can see I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
very small programs as you can see I
will<00:00:25.260> put<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.859> my<00:00:26.070> description<00:00:26.730> so

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
will put them up on my description so

will put them up on my description so
you<00:00:26.970> download<00:00:27.119> them<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.070> just<00:00:29.070> burn<00:00:29.250> them<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you download them and just burn them to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.749 
you download them and just burn them to
a<00:00:29.550> burn<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> an<00:00:30.900> actual<00:00:31.140> CD<00:00:31.529> okay<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.640> I'm

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
a burn them to an actual CD okay now I'm

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.069 
a burn them to an actual CD okay now I'm
going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.000> running<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.600> an<00:00:33.719> ISO

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
going to be running these on an ISO

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.360 
going to be running these on an ISO
image<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.649> actually<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.130> them<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
image so you can actually see them in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.660 
image so you can actually see them in
action<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.510> virtual<00:00:37.079> machine<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.670> okay

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
action on a virtual machine there okay

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.330 
action on a virtual machine there okay
so<00:00:39.020> if<00:00:40.020> you're<00:00:40.469> getting<00:00:40.590> any<00:00:40.860> problems<00:00:41.219> with

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so if you're getting any problems with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.080 
so if you're getting any problems with
your<00:00:41.399> pcs<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.210> locking<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:43.070> freezing<00:00:44.090> pcs

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
your pcs in locking up freezing pcs

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.410 
your pcs in locking up freezing pcs
freezing<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.989> crashing<00:00:47.059> anything<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
freezing or crashing anything like that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
freezing or crashing anything like that
it<00:00:48.600> may<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.989> problem<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.530> memory<00:00:49.890> as

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it may be a problem with your memory as

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
it may be a problem with your memory as
well<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.700> could<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.030> another<00:00:51.210> problem<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
well and could be another problem but I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
well and could be another problem but I
mean<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.410> best<00:00:52.620> thing<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> actually

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
mean the best thing to do is actually

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.479 
mean the best thing to do is actually
it's<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> process<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.170> elimination<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's a process of elimination really you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's a process of elimination really you
test<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.910> memory<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> swap<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.640> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
test your memory you can swap out but I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
test your memory you can swap out but I
mean<00:00:59.850> also<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.570> run<00:01:00.750> tests<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> as

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
mean also you can run tests on it as

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
mean also you can run tests on it as
well<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.010> test<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.489> there's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
well so if you test it and there's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
well so if you test it and there's
nothing<00:01:02.940> wrong<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
nothing wrong with it then you know to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.859 
nothing wrong with it then you know to
move<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:05.970> next<00:01:06.030> piece<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> hardware

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
move on to your next piece of hardware

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.420 
move on to your next piece of hardware
but<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.110> could<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.650> motherboard<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but it could be like motherboard or so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.420 
but it could be like motherboard or so
on<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.850> okay<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.159> these<00:01:11.159> should<00:01:11.400> be

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
on and so on okay so these should be

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.340 
on and so on okay so these should be
what<00:01:11.729> we're<00:01:11.850> gonna<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.210> run<00:01:12.360> mem<00:01:12.600> test<00:01:12.869> 86

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
what we're gonna do is run mem test 86

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.080 
what we're gonna do is run mem test 86
first<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.070> comes<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.670> any<00:01:14.790> errors

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
first if it comes up with any errors

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
first if it comes up with any errors
then<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:16.110> I'd<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.830> always<00:01:17.100> run<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
then what I'd like to do is always run a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
then what I'd like to do is always run a
second<00:01:17.880> piece<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> software<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.630> totally

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
second piece of software that's totally

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
second piece of software that's totally
different<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.310> comes<00:01:20.460> up

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
different just to see if it comes up

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
different just to see if it comes up
with<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.689> errors<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.290> any<00:01:23.070> other<00:01:23.250> errors

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
with the same errors or any other errors

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.219 
with the same errors or any other errors
if<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.000> doesn't<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:24.540> obviously<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.960> might<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
if it doesn't then obviously it might be

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.929 
if it doesn't then obviously it might be
a<00:01:25.259> problem<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> software<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.520> always<00:01:26.759> run

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
a problem in the software so always run

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
a problem in the software so always run
always<00:01:27.450> run<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:27.810> passes<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:28.829> different

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
always run two passes for two different

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.340 
always run two passes for two different
bits<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> software<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> let's<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.960> started

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
bits of software so let's get started

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.969 
bits of software so let's get started
anyway<00:01:32.360> I'm<00:01:33.360> gonna<00:01:33.479> boot<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.799> will

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
anyway I'm gonna boot this up so it will

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.020 
anyway I'm gonna boot this up so it will
look<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> bit<00:01:35.220> different<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:35.759> you're

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
look a bit different to what you're

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.760 
look a bit different to what you're
gonna<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.360> look<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.259> yours<00:01:37.530> because

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
gonna look look like on yours because

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.950 
gonna look look like on yours because
you're<00:01:37.950> gonna<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> move<00:01:38.579> into<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> PC<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you're gonna have it move into a PC and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.210 
you're gonna have it move into a PC and
once<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.259> boot<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
once you boot this up it's going to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010 
once you boot this up it's going to
start<00:01:41.520> running<00:01:41.700> straight<00:01:42.119> away<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.540> default

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
start running straight away on a default

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.740 
start running straight away on a default
setting<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.520> perfectly<00:01:45.030> fine<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.570> run

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
setting as that's perfectly fine to run

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.109 
setting as that's perfectly fine to run
that<00:01:45.960> okay<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.070> pic<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> place<00:01:47.700> where<00:01:47.939> you're

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that okay the pic the place where you're

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
that okay the pic the place where you're
interested<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.350> where<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.680> says<00:01:49.710> pass

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
interested in is here where it says pass

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.740 
interested in is here where it says pass
and<00:01:50.610> errors<00:01:51.360> okay<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.170> doesn't<00:01:52.530> mean<00:01:53.750> pass

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and errors okay this doesn't mean pass

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
and errors okay this doesn't mean pass
as<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.380> passed<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.219> test<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> passed

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
as in passed the test is passed

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
as in passed the test is passed
it<00:01:57.689> means<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.140> made<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.250> many<00:01:59.460> passes

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it means it's made that how many passes

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.420 
it means it's made that how many passes
across<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> full<00:02:00.750> piece<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.590> memory<00:02:02.009> okay<00:02:02.369> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
across the full piece of memory okay so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.149 
across the full piece of memory okay so
you<00:02:02.700> let<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.030> run<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.079> says<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:05.040> or

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you let that run and if it says one or

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.709 
you let that run and if it says one or
two<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.490> three<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.119> means<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.509> made

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
two or three here that means it's made

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.930 
two or three here that means it's made
three<00:02:06.990> passes<00:02:07.530> right<00:02:07.680> away<00:02:07.950> across<00:02:08.580> every

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
three passes right away across every

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
three passes right away across every
part<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> memory<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.410> test<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> okay<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
part of the memory to test it okay and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490 
part of the memory to test it okay and
the<00:02:12.030> errors<00:02:12.270> will<00:02:12.450> come<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the errors will come up and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.250 
the errors will come up and
we'll<00:02:13.620> say<00:02:13.830> three<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.820> four<00:02:15.240> whatever<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.990> if

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
we'll say three to four whatever and if

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.390 
we'll say three to four whatever and if
there<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.250> obviously

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
there is there then you have obviously

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.270 
there is there then you have obviously
got<00:02:17.760> problems<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.090> your<00:02:18.210> memory<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:19.280> take

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
got problems with your memory and take

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.970 
got problems with your memory and take
it<00:02:20.460> out<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.030> buy<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> new<00:02:21.810> sticker<00:02:22.170> memory<00:02:22.500> okay

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
it out and buy a new sticker memory okay

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.210 
it out and buy a new sticker memory okay
so<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> actual<00:02:24.890> program<00:02:25.890> as<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.040> can

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so this is the actual program as you can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.190 
so this is the actual program as you can
see<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.150> if<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.570> up<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> top

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
see here and if you see up the top

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
see here and if you see up the top
you'll<00:02:28.800> see<00:02:28.890> another<00:02:29.310> pass<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.940> there<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.240> is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
you'll see another pass up there this is

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.540 
you'll see another pass up there this is
what<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.780> doing<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.890> top<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> got

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
what it's doing up the top and you got

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.449 
what it's doing up the top and you got
the<00:02:32.670> test<00:02:32.910> itself<00:02:33.390> running<00:02:33.720> now<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.340> go

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the test itself running now this will go

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.550 
the test itself running now this will go
up<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.790> down<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.570> every<00:02:36.750> part<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> memory

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
up and down for every part of the memory

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.920 
up and down for every part of the memory
it's<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:38.040> she's<00:02:38.250> scanning<00:02:38.790> okay<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.690> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
it's as she's scanning okay and that you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.480 
it's as she's scanning okay and that you
can<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.470> little<00:02:40.680> change<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.130> you'll

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
can see it a little change here you'll

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.670 
can see it a little change here you'll
see<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.730> changing<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.050> goes<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.560> want

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
see all changing as it goes if you want

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440 
see all changing as it goes if you want
to<00:02:43.740> sit<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.100> watch<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.880> wouldn't

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
to sit there and watch it but I wouldn't

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.350 
to sit there and watch it but I wouldn't
advise<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.890> okay<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.130> leave<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.459> running<00:02:47.610> you

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
advise it okay just leave it running you

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.440 
advise it okay just leave it running you
can<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.959> through<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.350> patterns

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
can see it going through the patterns

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.610 
can see it going through the patterns
now<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> look<00:02:51.780> down<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> bottom<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.440> you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
now if you look down a bottom here you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.920 
now if you look down a bottom here you
can<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:53.010> some<00:02:53.190> actually<00:02:53.750> commands<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.840> can

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
can see some actually commands you can

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.500 
can see some actually commands you can
actually<00:02:55.260> push<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.800> push<00:02:55.980> see<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:57.390> will

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
actually push in if you push see it will

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.970 
actually push in if you push see it will
actually<00:02:57.810> give<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> actual<00:02:58.380> command

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
actually give you the actual command

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.650 
actually give you the actual command
here<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.550> actually<00:02:59.700> look<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.570> you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
here you can actually look so if you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.210 
here you can actually look so if you
push<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:00.989> one<00:03:01.110> now<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> keyboard<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.160> will

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
push up one now on the keyboard it will

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.040 
push up one now on the keyboard it will
actually<00:03:02.580> let<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.880> go<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.570> default

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
actually let you go in and say default

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.860 
actually let you go in and say default
test<00:03:04.290> skip<00:03:05.190> current<00:03:05.580> test<00:03:05.850> or<00:03:06.120> select<00:03:06.780> your

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
test skip current test or select your

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
test skip current test or select your
own<00:03:06.989> test<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:08.760> on

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
own test and so on and so on and so on

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.850 
own test and so on and so on and so on
okay<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.200> want<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.440> affect<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:10.800> you

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
okay so if you want to affect if you

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.830 
okay so if you want to affect if you
want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.070> go<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.730> actual<00:03:12.060> interface<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
want to go in the actual interface and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.590 
want to go in the actual interface and
change<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.920> way<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.190> scans<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.330> you

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
change the way it scans you can do you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.729 
change the way it scans you can do you
don't<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.020> leave<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.590> default

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
don't have to leave it on the default

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.240 
don't have to leave it on the default
scan<00:03:17.400> okay<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.720> that's<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.140> actual<00:03:19.260> mem<00:03:19.980> test

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
scan okay so that's the actual mem test

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.070 
scan okay so that's the actual mem test
eighty<00:03:20.459> six<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.880> not<00:03:21.000> much<00:03:21.209> else<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.750> really

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
eighty six is not much else to it really

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.530 
eighty six is not much else to it really
but<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.709> pretty<00:03:23.010> much<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:24.360> put

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
but that's pretty much it you just put

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.259 
but that's pretty much it you just put
it<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.019> run<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.220> let<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.820> see<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.120> it

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
it in and run it and let it see if it

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.190 
it in and run it and let it see if it
gives<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.630> any<00:03:28.880> errors<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:30.840> now<00:03:30.989> gonna

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
gives you any errors so I'm now gonna

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.780 
gives you any errors so I'm now gonna
boot<00:03:31.470> up<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.769> other<00:03:31.920> program<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.580> I'm<00:03:32.640> just

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
boot up the other program so I'm just

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.449 
boot up the other program so I'm just
gonna<00:03:32.880> shut<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.299> off<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.280> load<00:03:35.280> up<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
gonna shut this off and load up the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.979 
gonna shut this off and load up the
upper<00:03:35.790> iso<00:03:36.150> image<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.150> can<00:03:39.269> actually<00:03:39.360> see

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
upper iso image so we can actually see

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.420 
upper iso image so we can actually see
what<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> Microsoft<00:03:40.830> ones<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.220> Nana

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
what the Microsoft ones like Nana

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.850 
what the Microsoft ones like Nana
Microsoft<00:03:42.000> one<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.269> well<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.690> pretty<00:03:42.989> good<00:03:43.200> as

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
Microsoft one as well is pretty good as

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.000 
Microsoft one as well is pretty good as
well<00:03:44.690> though<00:03:45.690> right<00:03:45.989> off<00:03:46.140> always<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.860> use

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
well though right off always like to use

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.500 
well though right off always like to use
to<00:03:47.280> two<00:03:47.730> different<00:03:47.910> bits<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.329> software

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
to two different bits of software

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.150 
to two different bits of software
they're<00:03:48.870> ideal<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.380> have<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.620> your<00:03:49.709> wallet<00:03:49.920> at

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
they're ideal to have in your wallet at

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.009 
they're ideal to have in your wallet at
all<00:03:50.310> times<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:50.940> CD<00:03:51.299> wallet<00:03:51.540> leaking

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
all times you know you CD wallet leaking

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.830 
all times you know you CD wallet leaking
you<00:03:52.769> little<00:03:53.010> tools<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.459> for<00:03:53.640> your<00:03:53.760> PC<00:03:54.150> stuff

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you little tools in for your PC stuff

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.430 
you little tools in for your PC stuff
this<00:03:55.799> Andy<00:03:56.250> wants<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.670> have<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:56.970> there<00:03:57.180> yeah<00:03:57.600> so

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
this Andy wants to have in there yeah so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.990 
this Andy wants to have in there yeah so
as<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.769> see<00:03:58.980> it's<00:03:59.340> automatically

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
as you can see it's automatically

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.500 
as you can see it's automatically
starting<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.690> run<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.049> process<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.709> scanning

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
starting to run the process of scanning

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.479 
starting to run the process of scanning
the<00:04:03.510> memory<00:04:03.900> now<00:04:04.410> obviously<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:04.980> going

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
the memory now obviously this is going

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.500 
the memory now obviously this is going
to<00:04:05.549> be<00:04:05.610> slightly<00:04:05.820> different<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.299> is<00:04:06.480> a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
to be slightly different this is a

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.199 
to be slightly different this is a
virtual<00:04:06.780> machine<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.579> can<00:04:08.670> see<00:04:08.910> it's

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
virtual machine and as you can see it's

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.699 
virtual machine and as you can see it's
coming<00:04:09.480> up<00:04:09.660> active<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.440> can<00:04:10.530> see

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
coming up active and you can see

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.069 
coming up active and you can see
succeeded<00:04:11.340> okay<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.180> will<00:04:12.329> go<00:04:12.570> through<00:04:12.840> all

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
succeeded okay so it will go through all

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.590 
succeeded okay so it will go through all
the<00:04:13.320> patterns<00:04:13.709> okay<00:04:14.700> now<00:04:15.090> if<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.269> comes<00:04:15.480> up

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
the patterns okay now if it comes up

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.120 
the patterns okay now if it comes up
with<00:04:15.810> error<00:04:15.959> you'll<00:04:16.229> see<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.530> saying<00:04:16.859> error

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
with error you'll see it saying error

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.340 
with error you'll see it saying error
but<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.519> actually<00:04:17.850> gonna<00:04:18.030> run<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.140> whole

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
but it's actually gonna run the whole

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.710 
but it's actually gonna run the whole
passes<00:04:19.890> all<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.130> way<00:04:20.220> through<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.760> hopefully

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
passes all the way through and hopefully

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.270 
passes all the way through and hopefully
it'll<00:04:22.049> be<00:04:22.229> succeed<00:04:22.710> all<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.890> way<00:04:23.010> through

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
it'll be succeed all the way through

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.980 
it'll be succeed all the way through
okay<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.539> this<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.870> pretty<00:04:25.050> much

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
okay so this is pretty much

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.290 
okay so this is pretty much
you<00:04:26.650> can<00:04:26.860> see<00:04:27.039> at<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.250> top<00:04:27.430> there<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:27.910> on<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
you can see at the top there is on the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.050 
you can see at the top there is on the
top<00:04:28.539> this<00:04:28.720> time<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.169> got<00:04:29.319> B<00:04:29.590> forepaws<00:04:30.009> X<00:04:30.699> R

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
top this time you got B forepaws X R

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.420 
top this time you got B forepaws X R
exit<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.630> T<00:04:32.229> for<00:04:33.160> extended<00:04:33.880> tests<00:04:34.539> okay<00:04:35.530> so

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
exit and T for extended tests okay so

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.689 
exit and T for extended tests okay so
it's<00:04:37.330> pretty<00:04:37.660> much<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:38.919> is<00:04:39.069> really<00:04:39.430> just

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
it's pretty much what it is really just

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.809 
it's pretty much what it is really just
stick<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.319> rebooted<00:04:41.319> PC<00:04:41.680> boom<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.340> CD

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
and let the process run and so it's

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.670 
and let the process run and so it's
finished<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.539> whole<00:04:46.780> path<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.500> whole
