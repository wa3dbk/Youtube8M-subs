00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.459
 so hi to all here jeremy gilley is 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.500
 today for a new tutorial 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.939
 I will show you how to put 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.189
 the color on your keyboard 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.829
 so here as you see the color 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.570
 of my keyboard and blue so you can 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.509
 put the color as where the reds 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.130
 white or blue roses every 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.290
 colors that you want so 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.900
 the application is called rust color 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.150
 or board think of the history or had 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.489
 already have a device jailbroken and 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.559
 to have cydia so normally when 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.809
 your your iphone is jailbroken or 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.590
 should automatically see if there is 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.480
 so you click on cydia there he goes 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.850
 to have a load like in all 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.850
 6 10 years so we have to wait a bit 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.910
 it's a little long 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.960
 then once on the home page 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.329
 you just have to go in source you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:41.950
 did add edit and there you write 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:42.520
 cydia for x this is.com has added you 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.750
 source 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.789
 so I do not want to do it like I 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.740
 lai already if you already have this 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.780
 source not worth the added so 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.079
 I can cancel once the source has 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.720
 added 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:02:00.090
 you simply have to go in 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:05.950
 search and there you write color your 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.479
 good so after the y it's not a man 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.670
 and its 1 0 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.880
 so I had you install the source 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.640
 x elise caron coloring at the edge of the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.620
 buoy here it's under the bigboss source 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.940
 but it is paying and color your 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.069
 world free it's under the bigboss source 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.790
 it's free but it's not a 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.819
 very good version 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.590
 so you take the tweak that comes from 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.320
 the source x so elects there as you 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.810
 see it tells him celine you 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.120
 you install it for me I'm not going to 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.799
 do as I say in the room and they 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.549
 will ask you to restart your 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.069
 springboard 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.840
 once the springboard restarts and 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.730
 you will have a new icon and this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.180
 icon it's color your world you 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.269
 click on it and there you choose the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.680
 color you want you can you 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.840
 have seen in order to tune me the color 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.450

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.280
 I choose robert 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.389

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.170

 return to your springboard 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.250
 and there you do a reboot so 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.799
 you turn off your phone and you 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.660

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.400
