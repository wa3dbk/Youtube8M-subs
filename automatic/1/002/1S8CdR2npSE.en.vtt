00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 bye 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.620
 good to all I am care plan and today I 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.270
 I come to present an unboxing of nothing 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.580
 more and nothing less than the tekken tag 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.779
 tournament that is so fucking good 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.610
 that does not deserve to take the title of 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.710
 secondo and that is has this title only 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.119
 by going behind the touch ornament of 98 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.130
 for tekken fans 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.779
 in this game you can use the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.820
 most endearing characters and use 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.320
 equipment that you think is convenient using 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.969
 well special moves when playing in 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.860
 the mode is why it's called so tekken 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.930
 tag tournament you already know combats by 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.450
 Couples and news as the tag assault 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.400
 grabs using both characters and the 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.200
 possibility of sending the fighter to another 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.490
 level and endless etceteras what 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.870
 more has struck me is that in 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.360
 this game is in a lot of characters 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.160
 from iun kazama to the trio greg no 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.020
 they have left neither the Boscono doctor bits 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.730
 which is a point in favor of the game 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.980
 another one of the most interesting things is 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.460
 that the characters speak on their own 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.320
 language 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.510
 in the end I highly recommend this game or 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.140
 be I have had the opportunity to 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.269
 catch the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.550
 in the special edition that comes with your 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.970
 art book your soundtrack with the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.800
 remixes and the cd of normal songs is 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.430
 a little what you see and this has been all 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.430
 what boxing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 do not 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.330
 and the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 victorious
