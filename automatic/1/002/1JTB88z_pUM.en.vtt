oh<00:07:08.389> for<00:07:08.630> sure<00:07:08.690> I<00:07:08.840> think<00:07:09.139> I<00:07:09.290> what's<00:07:09.500> it<00:07:09.620> like

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
oh for sure I think I what's it like

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.170 
oh for sure I think I what's it like
once<00:07:10.070> I<00:07:10.130> got<00:07:10.220> into<00:07:10.370> training<00:07:10.639> camp<00:07:10.760> there<00:07:11.090> you

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
once I got into training camp there you

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.790 
once I got into training camp there you
just<00:07:11.270> kind<00:07:11.479> of<00:07:11.510> notice<00:07:11.750> it<00:07:11.840> took<00:07:11.990> like<00:07:12.110> a<00:07:12.169> week

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
just kind of notice it took like a week

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.230 
just kind of notice it took like a week
or<00:07:13.160> so<00:07:13.310> we're<00:07:13.430> just<00:07:13.460> gonna<00:07:13.639> get<00:07:13.820> used<00:07:13.970> to<00:07:14.120> it

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
or so we're just gonna get used to it

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.510 
or so we're just gonna get used to it
but<00:07:14.560> all<00:07:15.560> I<00:07:15.590> think<00:07:15.889> it<00:07:16.010> is<00:07:16.160> a<00:07:16.190> kind<00:07:16.460> of

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
but all I think it is a kind of

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.460 
but all I think it is a kind of
advantage<00:07:16.850> law<00:07:17.150> I<00:07:17.360> think<00:07:17.690> that<00:07:17.870> to<00:07:18.050> have<00:07:18.200> that

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
advantage law I think that to have that

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.810 
advantage law I think that to have that
you<00:07:18.889> know<00:07:18.979> when<00:07:19.070> we<00:07:19.160> come<00:07:19.340> down<00:07:19.370> to<00:07:19.639> sea<00:07:19.790> level

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
you know when we come down to sea level

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.670 
you know when we come down to sea level
one<00:07:20.060> stuff<00:07:20.240> like<00:07:20.360> that<00:07:20.389> we<00:07:21.200> just<00:07:21.410> be<00:07:21.560> doing

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
one stuff like that we just be doing

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.320 
one stuff like that we just be doing
like<00:07:21.860> a<00:07:21.919> little<00:07:22.250> bit<00:07:22.340> extra<00:07:22.460> I<00:07:22.639> think<00:07:22.970> and<00:07:23.210> I

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
like a little bit extra I think and I

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.420 
like a little bit extra I think and I
think<00:07:23.360> helps<00:07:24.350> out<00:07:24.500> for<00:07:24.710> a<00:07:24.740> full<00:07:24.889> 60<00:07:25.190> minute

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
think helps out for a full 60 minute

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.950 
think helps out for a full 60 minute
game<00:07:25.580> third<00:07:26.000> period<00:07:26.360> I<00:07:26.389> think<00:07:26.540> we<00:07:26.630> got<00:07:26.780> a

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
game third period I think we got a

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.510 
game third period I think we got a
little<00:07:27.289> bit<00:07:27.440> extra<00:07:27.530> when<00:07:27.770> most<00:07:28.130> teams<00:07:28.340> might

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
little bit extra when most teams might

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.100 
little bit extra when most teams might
not<00:07:28.640> have<00:07:28.760> it<00:07:28.880> how<00:07:29.330> about<00:07:29.510> for<00:07:29.660> you<00:07:29.690> gave<00:07:29.990> me

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110 
not have it how about for you gave me

not have it how about for you gave me
your<00:07:30.200> first<00:07:30.440> year<00:07:30.650> was<00:07:30.800> it<00:07:30.950> something<00:07:31.220> that

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
your first year was it something that

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.159 
your first year was it something that
you<00:07:31.669> had<00:07:32.030> to<00:07:32.150> really<00:07:32.330> deal<00:07:32.570> with<00:07:32.750> early<00:07:32.990> on<00:07:33.140> a

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
you had to really deal with early on a

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:34.870 
you had to really deal with early on a
training<00:07:33.470> camp<00:07:33.680> and<00:07:33.919> get<00:07:34.100> used<00:07:34.280> to<00:07:34.460> yeah<00:07:34.850> I
