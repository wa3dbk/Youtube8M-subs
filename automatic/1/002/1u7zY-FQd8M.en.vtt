00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
what it is so this map is pretty awesome

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.420 
what it is so this map is pretty awesome
the<00:01:04.750> creativity<00:01:05.260> behind<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.860> map<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.190> one<00:01:06.340> of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
the creativity behind the map is one of

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.240 
the creativity behind the map is one of
the<00:01:06.580> best<00:01:06.880> things<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.840> have<00:01:07.870> seen<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.680> ideas

the best things I have seen the ideas
that<00:01:09.280> went<00:01:09.790> into<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.090> map<00:01:10.300> are<00:01:10.540> pretty

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
that went into this map are pretty

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.960 
that went into this map are pretty
awesome<00:01:10.900> some<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.040> details<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.729> went

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
awesome some of the details that went

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.460 
awesome some of the details that went
into<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.270> map<00:01:13.510> are<00:01:13.660> pretty<00:01:13.930> awesome<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.380> not

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
into this map are pretty awesome and not

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.340 
into this map are pretty awesome and not
only<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.800> um<00:01:15.580> it's<00:01:16.450> created<00:01:17.050> by<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.229> same

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
only that um it's created by the same

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.920 
only that um it's created by the same
maker<00:01:17.890> who<00:01:18.580> made<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.060> Roman<00:01:19.420> Hunger<00:01:19.720> Games

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
maker who made the Roman Hunger Games

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.109 
maker who made the Roman Hunger Games
which<00:01:20.170> was<00:01:20.320> my<00:01:20.470> last<00:01:20.710> map<00:01:21.070> showcase<00:01:21.580> preview

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
which was my last map showcase preview

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.570 
which was my last map showcase preview
review<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.869> if<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.470> didn't<00:01:23.830> watch<00:01:24.009> that<00:01:24.340> then

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
review and if you didn't watch that then

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.850 
review and if you didn't watch that then
go<00:01:25.090> check<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:25.540> one<00:01:25.720> out<00:01:25.750> also<00:01:26.080> because<00:01:26.290> that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
go check that one out also because that

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.550 
go check that one out also because that
map<00:01:27.070> had<00:01:27.340> tons<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:28.000> detail<00:01:28.509> in<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.380> think

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
map had tons of detail in it so I think

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.960 
map had tons of detail in it so I think
you<00:01:29.800> guys<00:01:29.920> would<00:01:30.070> enjoy<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.400> as<00:01:30.759> well

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
you guys would enjoy that as well

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.240 
you guys would enjoy that as well
because<00:01:31.360> it's<00:01:31.509> made<00:01:31.660> by<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.869> same<00:01:31.990> creator<00:01:32.619> so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
because it's made by the same creator so

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.370 
because it's made by the same creator so
one<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.940> coolest<00:01:34.390> things<00:01:34.690> about<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:35.110> map

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
one of the coolest things about this map

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.650 
one of the coolest things about this map
right<00:01:35.770> away<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.310> noticed<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:36.940> that<00:01:37.360> the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
right away that I noticed is that the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.219 
right away that I noticed is that the
actual<00:01:37.869> Hunger<00:01:38.740> Games<00:01:38.979> map<00:01:39.509> takes<00:01:40.509> place<00:01:40.930> in

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
actual Hunger Games map takes place in

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.570 
actual Hunger Games map takes place in
the<00:01:41.979> end<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.509> it's<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:44.229> whole<00:01:44.560> new<00:01:44.979> world<00:01:45.399> that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
the end so it's a whole new world that

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.359 
the end so it's a whole new world that
you<00:01:45.759> have<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.119> explore<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:47.020> know<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
you have to explore you know the the

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.749 
you have to explore you know the the
creativity<00:01:48.970> just<00:01:49.690> expands<00:01:50.350> right<00:01:50.560> away<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.490> it

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
creativity just expands right away so it

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.450 
creativity just expands right away so it
takes<00:01:51.970> place<00:01:52.300> on<00:01:52.509> earth<00:01:52.740> 266<00:01:53.740> with<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.190> city

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
takes place on earth 266 with the city

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.980 
takes place on earth 266 with the city
texture<00:01:54.940> pack<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.330> make<00:01:55.479> sure<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.780> have<00:01:55.960> the

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
texture pack so make sure you have the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.900 
texture pack so make sure you have the
city<00:01:56.289> texture<00:01:56.679> pack<00:01:56.860> when<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.130> play<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.460> I'm

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
city texture pack when you play this I'm

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.450 
city texture pack when you play this I'm
not<00:01:58.210> sure<00:01:58.360> if<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.600> exactly<00:01:59.440> need<00:01:59.560> it<00:02:00.009> but<00:02:00.280> it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
not sure if you exactly need it but it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.279 
not sure if you exactly need it but it
probably<00:02:00.759> does<00:02:01.210> help<00:02:01.450> considering<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.170> was

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
probably does help considering if it was

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.719 
probably does help considering if it was
built<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.710> city<00:02:02.920> texture<00:02:03.310> pack<00:02:03.520> it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
built on the city texture pack it

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.460 
built on the city texture pack it
probably<00:02:04.240> meant<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.660> be<00:02:04.780> played<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.289> city

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
probably meant to be played on the city

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.340 
probably meant to be played on the city
texture<00:02:05.890> pack<00:02:06.069> you<00:02:06.250> know<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:07.360> that's<00:02:08.080> one<00:02:08.319> of

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
texture pack you know so that's one of

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.050 
texture pack you know so that's one of
the<00:02:08.470> things<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.800> wanted<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.100> talk<00:02:09.280> about<00:02:09.399> also<00:02:10.030> I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
the things I wanted to talk about also I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.990 
the things I wanted to talk about also I
want<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.479> talk<00:02:10.630> about<00:02:10.660> size<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.670> maps<00:02:12.880> i

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
want to talk about size of the maps i

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.280 
want to talk about size of the maps i
like<00:02:13.150> talking<00:02:13.300> about<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> size<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.080> maps

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
like talking about the size of the maps

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.710 
like talking about the size of the maps
on<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.890> maps<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.220> i<00:02:15.340> do<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:16.150> could<00:02:16.540> be

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
on all the maps that i do this could be

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.809 
on all the maps that i do this could be
considered<00:02:17.020> small<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.740> medium<00:02:18.100> size<00:02:18.370> after

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
considered small to medium size after

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
considered small to medium size after
looking<00:02:19.300> around<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.660> entire<00:02:19.930> map<00:02:20.230> there<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
looking around the entire map there is a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.660 
looking around the entire map there is a
lot<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.910> things<00:02:22.270> going<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.670> decent

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
lot of things going on in a decent

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.650 
lot of things going on in a decent
amount<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.180> place<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.319> having<00:02:27.010> about<00:02:27.340> five<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
amount of place so having about five to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.830 
amount of place so having about five to
eight<00:02:28.690> players<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.770> work<00:02:30.040> best<00:02:30.520> any<00:02:31.000> less

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
eight players would work best any less

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.830 
eight players would work best any less
would<00:02:32.590> work<00:02:32.860> fine<00:02:33.130> as<00:02:33.340> well<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:34.000> eight

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
would work fine as well but eight

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.510 
would work fine as well but eight
players<00:02:35.230> could<00:02:35.590> fit<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.800> here<00:02:36.099> there<00:02:36.310> might<00:02:36.459> be

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
players could fit on here there might be

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.610 
players could fit on here there might be
too<00:02:36.849> many<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.510> say<00:02:37.720> eight<00:02:37.990> but<00:02:38.349> it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
too many if you say eight but it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.500 
too many if you say eight but it's
pretty<00:02:38.830> good<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.340> pretty<00:02:39.610> good<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.970> sizes

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
pretty good it's pretty good the sizes

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.260 
pretty good it's pretty good the sizes
medium<00:02:41.050> sized<00:02:41.560> i<00:02:41.950> wouldn't<00:02:42.490> call<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.730> large<00:02:43.000> at

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
medium sized i wouldn't call it large at

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.870 
medium sized i wouldn't call it large at
all<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:44.290> there's<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.770> lot<00:02:44.980> going<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.700> i

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
all but there's a lot going on and i

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.490 
all but there's a lot going on and i
think<00:02:46.150> eight<00:02:46.360> players<00:02:46.720> would<00:02:46.990> be<00:02:47.110> able<00:02:47.380> to

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
think eight players would be able to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.309 
think eight players would be able to
play<00:02:47.680> fine<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.550> wanted<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.780> that's<00:02:50.200> in

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
play fine if they wanted to so that's in

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.050 
play fine if they wanted to so that's in
regards<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:50.950> eight<00:02:51.250> players<00:02:51.550> but<00:02:51.880> just

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
regards to the eight players but just

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.890 
regards to the eight players but just
just<00:02:52.330> look<00:02:52.630> around<00:02:52.810> look<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.920> end<00:02:54.160> sky<00:02:55.060> makes

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
just look around look the end sky makes

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.319 
just look around look the end sky makes
this<00:02:56.140> map<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:57.040> much<00:02:57.280> cooler<00:02:57.579> than<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.849> is<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
this map so much cooler than it is and

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.120 
this map so much cooler than it is and
the<00:02:58.450> end<00:02:58.629> sky

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the end sky

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.940 
the end sky
actually<00:02:59.340> shadows<00:03:00.270> out<00:03:00.540> farther<00:03:01.050> away<00:03:01.410> things

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
actually shadows out farther away things

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.790 
actually shadows out farther away things
so<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.880> get<00:03:03.180> closer<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.780> them<00:03:04.020> they<00:03:04.200> appear

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
so as you get closer to them they appear

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.680 
so as you get closer to them they appear
in<00:03:05.040> front<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.430> face<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.510> like
