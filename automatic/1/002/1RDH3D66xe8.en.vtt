00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
I have it with me today the HP Envy dv7

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.400 
I have it with me today the HP Envy dv7
and<00:00:06.950> DV<00:00:07.370> 6<00:00:07.639> so<00:00:07.819> the<00:00:07.939> DD<00:00:08.240> 7<00:00:08.420> is<00:00:08.660> turned<00:00:08.929> on<00:00:09.110> and<00:00:09.139> on

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
and DV 6 so the DD 7 is turned on and on

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.369 
and DV 6 so the DD 7 is turned on and on
the<00:00:09.559> left<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.129> DV<00:00:10.700> 6<00:00:10.969> is<00:00:11.150> on<00:00:11.299> the<00:00:11.389> right<00:00:11.599> the<00:00:12.049> DV

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
the left the DV 6 is on the right the DV

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.520 
the left the DV 6 is on the right the DV
7<00:00:12.799> has<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:12.980> 17<00:00:13.610> point<00:00:13.849> one<00:00:14.150> inch<00:00:14.360> screen<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:15.169> DV

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
7 has a 17 point one inch screen the DV

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.520 
7 has a 17 point one inch screen the DV
6<00:00:15.829> has<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.010> 15.6<00:00:17.000> inch<00:00:17.150> screen<00:00:17.330> all<00:00:18.110> I'm<00:00:18.260> doing

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530 
6 has a 15.6 inch screen all I'm doing

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.200 
6 has a 15.6 inch screen all I'm doing
here<00:00:18.680> is<00:00:18.740> going<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.010> compare<00:00:19.430> it<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:19.700> sizes

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
here is going to compare it the sizes

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.210 
here is going to compare it the sizes
and<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.480> weight<00:00:20.660> of<00:00:20.690> these<00:00:20.990> two<00:00:21.260> notebooks<00:00:21.740> in

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
and the weight of these two notebooks in

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.470 
and the weight of these two notebooks in
case<00:00:22.430> you're<00:00:22.580> trying<00:00:22.670> to<00:00:22.820> decide<00:00:23.060> which<00:00:23.270> one

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
case you're trying to decide which one

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.500 
case you're trying to decide which one
might<00:00:23.720> be<00:00:23.810> better<00:00:24.020> for<00:00:24.140> you<00:00:24.580> so<00:00:25.580> as<00:00:26.120> you<00:00:26.390> can

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
might be better for you so as you can

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.240 
might be better for you so as you can
tell<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:26.840> looks<00:00:26.930> like<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.230> DV<00:00:27.560> 6<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:27.950> kind<00:00:28.160> of

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
tell it looks like the DV 6 is kind of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.360 
tell it looks like the DV 6 is kind of
dwarfed<00:00:28.670> by<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.880> DV<00:00:29.270> 7<00:00:29.510> here<00:00:29.870> if<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:30.890> stand<00:00:31.190> up

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
dwarfed by the DV 7 here if I stand up

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.819 
dwarfed by the DV 7 here if I stand up
you'll<00:00:31.640> see<00:00:31.670> that<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.210> footprint<00:00:32.780> is<00:00:32.960> also

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
you'll see that the footprint is also

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.150 
you'll see that the footprint is also
quite<00:00:34.429> bit<00:00:34.850> bigger<00:00:35.179> now<00:00:35.899> I<00:00:35.929> actually<00:00:36.530> have<00:00:36.739> the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
quite bit bigger now I actually have the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.060 
quite bit bigger now I actually have the
9<00:00:37.370> cell<00:00:37.670> battery<00:00:38.089> for<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.539> DV<00:00:38.899> 6<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.530> it<00:00:39.890> makes

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
9 cell battery for the DV 6 and it makes

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.340 
9 cell battery for the DV 6 and it makes
me<00:00:40.219> kind<00:00:40.339> of<00:00:40.460> you'll<00:00:40.850> see<00:00:41.030> here<00:00:41.300> it's<00:00:42.199> got<00:00:42.260> a

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
me kind of you'll see here it's got a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.079 
me kind of you'll see here it's got a
big<00:00:42.530> pump<00:00:42.980> on<00:00:43.159> it<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:43.579> makes<00:00:43.699> you<00:00:43.850> kind<00:00:44.030> of

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
big pump on it so it makes you kind of

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.060 
big pump on it so it makes you kind of
stick<00:00:44.420> up<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:44.899> didn't<00:00:45.320> put<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:45.679> which<00:00:45.920> is

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
stick up so I didn't put it in which is

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.700 
stick up so I didn't put it in which is
why<00:00:46.190> it's<00:00:46.399> turned<00:00:46.640> off<00:00:46.789> because<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.929> DV<00:00:48.230> 7<00:00:48.469> I

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
why it's turned off because the DV 7 I

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.520 
why it's turned off because the DV 7 I
have<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.219> regular<00:00:49.370> 6<00:00:49.850> cell<00:00:50.059> which<00:00:50.269> is<00:00:50.719> flush

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
have that regular 6 cell which is flush

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.119 
have that regular 6 cell which is flush
so<00:00:52.239> you'll<00:00:53.239> notice<00:00:53.449> that<00:00:53.569> as<00:00:53.899> far<00:00:54.170> as<00:00:54.199> thinness

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
so you'll notice that as far as thinness

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.119 
so you'll notice that as far as thinness
they're<00:00:55.760> exactly<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.390> same<00:00:56.679> so<00:00:57.679> you're<00:00:58.039> not

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
they're exactly the same so you're not

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.099 
they're exactly the same so you're not
gonna<00:00:58.309> get<00:00:58.519> any<00:00:58.670> difference<00:00:59.120> there<00:00:59.329> really

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
gonna get any difference there really

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.229 
gonna get any difference there really
where<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.530> difference<00:01:00.889> comes<00:01:00.979> in<00:01:01.460> is<00:01:02.089> just

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
where the difference comes in is just

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.960 
where the difference comes in is just
the<00:01:02.690> footprint<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.559> fact<00:01:03.889> that<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.280> DV<00:01:04.670> 6

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
the footprint and the fact that the DV 6

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.330 
the footprint and the fact that the DV 6
if<00:01:05.120> we<00:01:05.239> put<00:01:05.479> them<00:01:05.659> lined<00:01:06.290> up<00:01:06.469> here<00:01:06.770> hinged<00:01:07.219> a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
if we put them lined up here hinged a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.420 
if we put them lined up here hinged a
hinge<00:01:08.200> it's<00:01:09.200> going<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.590> be<00:01:09.710> much<00:01:09.890> shorter<00:01:10.399> than

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
hinge it's going to be much shorter than

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.709 
hinge it's going to be much shorter than
what<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.969> DV<00:01:11.210> 7<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.570> now<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:13.060> put<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.149> on<00:01:14.210> top<00:01:14.509> you

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
what the DV 7 is now I put it on top you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.709 
what the DV 7 is now I put it on top you
get<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.869> better<00:01:15.079> overall<00:01:15.590> comparison<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.360> if<00:01:17.600> I

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
get a better overall comparison so if I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.980 
get a better overall comparison so if I
just<00:01:18.020> put<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:19.130> DV<00:01:19.490> 6<00:01:19.789> in<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.240> back

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
just put the DV 6 in the back

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.450 
just put the DV 6 in the back
I've<00:01:21.500> even<00:01:21.860> enough<00:01:22.070> on<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.310> back<00:01:22.460> corner<00:01:22.939> here

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
I've even enough on the back corner here

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.560 
I've even enough on the back corner here
you'll<00:01:25.460> see<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.780> DV<00:01:27.289> 6<00:01:27.619> again<00:01:28.570> smaller

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
you'll see that the DV 6 again smaller

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.190 
you'll see that the DV 6 again smaller
footprint<00:01:30.159> so<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:32.479> next<00:01:32.689> step<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:33.049> to

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
footprint so the next step is to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.480 
footprint so the next step is to
actually<00:01:33.320> weigh<00:01:33.680> these<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.100> see<00:01:34.219> what<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
actually weigh these and see what the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.840 
actually weigh these and see what the
weight<00:01:34.640> difference<00:01:35.060> is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.690 

right<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.180> waiting<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> HP<00:01:40.170> MBD<00:01:40.799> d7<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
right now I'm waiting the HP MBD d7 and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.410 
right now I'm waiting the HP MBD d7 and
it<00:01:42.299> weighs<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.780> six<00:01:43.229> pounds<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.280> ten<00:01:44.850> point

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it weighs in at six pounds and ten point

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
it weighs in at six pounds and ten point
two<00:01:45.840> ounces<00:01:46.310> okay<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.369> remember<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.820> now

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
two ounces okay so remember that now

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.870 
two ounces okay so remember that now
we'll<00:01:48.270> put<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.450> DP<00:01:48.840> six<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> scale

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.770 

and<00:01:52.880> here<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:53.450> have<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.930> NBD<00:01:54.409> v6<00:01:54.890> with<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:56.299> six

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
and here we have the NBD v6 with the six

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.170 
and here we have the NBD v6 with the six
battery<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.680> it's<00:01:57.830> five<00:01:58.549> pounds<00:01:58.790> seven

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
battery and it's five pounds seven

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.060 
battery and it's five pounds seven
ounces<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.659> it's<00:01:59.810> over<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.110> full<00:02:00.409> pound<00:02:00.710> lighter
