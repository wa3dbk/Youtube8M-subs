carrying the lumber I'm expecting it to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.510 
carrying the lumber I'm expecting it to
character<00:00:31.710> lumbering<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.160> that's<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
character lumbering but that's just the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.310 
character lumbering but that's just the
birdie<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.360> bit<00:00:33.510> later<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.780> me

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

but<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> turns<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.690> he<00:00:36.870> does<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.140> have

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but it turns out that he does not have

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
but it turns out that he does not have
that<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.370> good<00:00:38.579> ordeal<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.270> don't

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that which is a good ordeal so I don't

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.270 
that which is a good ordeal so I don't
have<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> force<00:00:39.809> his<00:00:40.140> Garchomp<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> switch<00:00:41.040> on

the secondary turn he has she wanted a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
the secondary turn he has she wanted a

flare blitz on my rotor my kind of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
flare blitz on my rotor my kind of
ignore<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.140> taking<00:00:46.320> her<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
ignore that but I was taking her back to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.900 
ignore that but I was taking her back to
my<00:00:46.710> mind<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.039> why<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
my mind like why not just go for the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
my mind like why not just go for the
dragon<00:00:48.239> club<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.690> again<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.469> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
dragon club but then again that do have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.080 
dragon club but then again that do have
mega<00:00:50.070> mall<00:00:50.340> while<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.730> guess<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.000> was

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
mega mall while so I guess he was

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
mega mall while so I guess he was
predicting<00:00:51.510> me<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.870> into<00:00:52.199> my<00:00:52.469> mega<00:00:52.680> wall

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
while for that term before you will

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
while for that term before you will
presumably<00:00:55.289> go<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> substitute<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
presumably go for like a substitute and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
presumably go for like a substitute and
or<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> protector<00:00:58.199> something<00:00:58.440> like

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
or like the protector something like

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 
or like the protector something like
that<00:00:58.680> presuming<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.789> try<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.149> up

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that presuming that I will try to get up

I<00:01:01.649> set<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.340> guess<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.239> his<00:01:03.449> train

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I set up I guess that is what his train

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.810 
I set up I guess that is what his train
of<00:01:03.780> thought<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.489> turns
