00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
will pop up and this is broken down into

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.870 
will pop up and this is broken down into
two<00:03:19.600> sections<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.920> also<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.610> first

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
two sections and this also is the first

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.729 
two sections and this also is the first
time<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.209> your<00:03:22.630> guild<00:03:22.870> leader<00:03:23.049> will<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.560> to

time that your guild leader will have to

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.380 
time that your guild leader will have to
make<00:03:23.860> some<00:03:24.040> decisions<00:03:24.100> about<00:03:24.640> their<00:03:24.940> campaign

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
make some decisions about their campaign

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
make some decisions about their campaign
the<00:03:25.989> first<00:03:26.260> thing<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.799> do<00:03:27.040> is

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the first thing that you have to do is

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.000 
the first thing that you have to do is
choose<00:03:27.880> which<00:03:28.299> region<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.500> wish<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.739> be<00:03:29.860> van

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
choose which region you wish to be van

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.319 
choose which region you wish to be van
Arkel<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.700> split<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.060> into<00:03:31.150> three

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
Arkel so this is split up into three

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.970 
Arkel so this is split up into three
sections<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.200> can<00:03:32.350> only<00:03:32.440> choose<00:03:32.590> one<00:03:32.769> of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
sections and you can only choose one of

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.120 
sections and you can only choose one of
them<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.760> first<00:03:33.970> one<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.360> run<00:03:35.130> second

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
them so the first one is a run second

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.490 
them so the first one is a run second
one<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.340> Southern<00:03:36.670> sharra<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.380> finally<00:03:38.380> we

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
one is Southern sharra and finally we

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.740 
one is Southern sharra and finally we
have<00:03:38.620> Northern<00:03:39.010> chara<00:03:39.280> once<00:03:40.239> they<00:03:40.390> choose<00:03:40.630> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
have Northern chara once they choose the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.660 
have Northern chara once they choose the
region<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.260> they<00:03:41.350> want<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.739> then<00:03:42.280> split<00:03:42.549> up

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
region that they want is then split up

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.670 
region that they want is then split up
into<00:03:42.790> sub<00:03:43.120> zones<00:03:43.360> believe<00:03:44.200> there's<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.410> five

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
into sub zones believe there's like five

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.650 
into sub zones believe there's like five
or<00:03:44.829> six<00:03:44.980> each<00:03:45.250> one<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.700> your<00:03:46.090> GM<00:03:46.360> will<00:03:46.480> now

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
