is a dynamic flexibility exercise for a
famous<00:01:37.780> tree<00:01:37.930> so<00:01:38.260> just<00:01:38.920> going<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.130> hold<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.370> to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
famous tree so just going to hold on to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.780 
famous tree so just going to hold on to
something<00:01:39.670> for<00:01:39.910> support<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:41.190> then<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.580> leg

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
something for support and then one leg

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.700 
something for support and then one leg
is<00:01:42.940> going<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.180> kick<00:01:43.390> up<00:01:43.570> just<00:01:44.350> go<00:01:44.470> nice<00:01:44.650> and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
is going to kick up just go nice and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.470 
is going to kick up just go nice and
easy<00:01:45.010> because<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.370> don't<00:01:45.580> want<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.790> be<00:01:46.240> too

easy because you don't want to be too

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.440 
easy because you don't want to be too
hard<00:01:47.430> starts<00:01:48.430> answering<00:01:48.670> two<00:01:49.060> months<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
hard starts answering two months of the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.840 
hard starts answering two months of the
first<00:01:49.660> one<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.530> increase<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.280> range<00:01:51.700> of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
first one and just increase the range of

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.980 
first one and just increase the range of
motion<00:01:54.660> with<00:01:55.660> each<00:01:55.900> sling

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.590 

so<00:02:01.619> 20<00:02:01.950> reps<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.400> side<00:02:02.640> 20<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> other

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so 20 reps on one side 20 on the other

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
so 20 reps on one side 20 on the other
they<00:02:04.320> didn't<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:04.799> something<00:02:05.040> called<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
they didn't go into something called a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.389 
they didn't go into something called a
pull<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.149> push<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> spread<00:02:08.250> your

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
pull down push up so to spread your

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.030 
pull down push up so to spread your
fingers<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:11.270> actually<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.360> down<00:02:12.920> tuck<00:02:13.920> your

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
fingers and actually go down tuck your
