here<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> fact<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
here we know for a fact that one of the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.209 
here we know for a fact that one of the
animes<00:00:34.079> some<00:00:34.320> rice<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.860> caught<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.160> a

Pokeball<00:00:35.430> which<00:00:36.149> means<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.780> just

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
Pokeball which means it's not just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
Pokeball which means it's not just
limited<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.440> Pokemon<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.160> ethical<00:00:38.579> standpoint

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
limited to Pokemon an ethical standpoint

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.729 
limited to Pokemon an ethical standpoint
it's<00:00:39.270> pretty<00:00:39.480> obvious<00:00:39.840> why<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.140> program<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it's pretty obvious why they program is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
it's pretty obvious why they program is
not<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.250> catch<00:00:41.399> humans<00:00:42.030> however<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
not to catch humans however this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 
not to catch humans however this
suggests<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.460> program<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
suggests that you could program it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.029 
suggests that you could program it
otherwise<00:00:45.899> when<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:46.890> how

otherwise when you think about how

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
otherwise when you think about how
Pokemon<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.789> accessed<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.239> computers

how<00:00:51.480> powerful<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.260> technology<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
how powerful this technology really is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
how powerful this technology really is
it<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:54.030> teleport<00:00:54.360> people<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.320> could

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it could teleport people like I could

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
it could teleport people like I could
instantly<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.579> cut<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
instantly go from here cut here and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.010 
instantly go from here cut here and
split<00:00:58.649> second<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.789> great<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
split second how great would that be so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
split second how great would that be so
why<00:01:01.230> haven't<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.800> done<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.219> yet<00:01:02.460> well<00:01:03.239> I

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
why haven't they done it yet well I

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
why haven't they done it yet well I
think<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.870> look<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> our<00:01:04.260> society<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.949> may

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
think if we look to our society we may

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.980 
think if we look to our society we may
be<00:01:05.189> able<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> find<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:06.000> answers<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.750> kind

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
be able to find some answers it's kind

kind of controversial while there is
great<00:01:12.270> potential<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> research

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
great potential in this kind of research

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
great potential in this kind of research
there<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> possibility<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.060> human<00:01:15.240> DNA

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
there is a possibility that human DNA

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.590 
there is a possibility that human DNA
just<00:01:16.619> doesn't<00:01:17.220> work<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> people

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
just doesn't work with it and people

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
just doesn't work with it and people
might<00:01:19.110> die<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.920> usually<00:01:20.369> international

might die and usually international

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
might die and usually international
research<00:01:21.210> laws<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.659> big<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.320> people

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
research laws are not big on people

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
research laws are not big on people
dying<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.240> they're<00:01:24.479> there

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
dying that's kind of why they're there

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
dying that's kind of why they're there
in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> first<00:01:25.320> place<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> world

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
in the first place so what the world

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
in the first place so what the world
needs<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> some<00:01:27.420> sort<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.659> mad<00:01:27.930> scientist<00:01:28.710> type
