00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
love on the floor that I see so when

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
love on the floor that I see so when
anybody<00:01:16.650> zombies<00:01:17.070> run<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> farm<00:01:17.909> look<00:01:18.119> at

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
anybody zombies run into it farm look at

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
anybody zombies run into it farm look at
them<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:18.869> into<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> they

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
them they just go right into it and they

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.490 
them they just go right into it and they
pretty<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.640> straightaway<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
pretty much do I straightaway so it's a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.230 
pretty much do I straightaway so it's a
lot<00:01:22.680> more<00:01:22.710> powerful<00:01:23.070> than<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.670> pressing<00:01:24.090> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
lot more powerful than just pressing on

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210 
lot more powerful than just pressing on
T<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.020> obviously<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.530> takes<00:01:25.710> something<00:01:26.009> more

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
T but obviously it takes something more

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
T but obviously it takes something more
ammo<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ammo not just one and so these that's a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
ammo not just one and so these that's a
really<00:01:28.890> cool<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.759> white<00:01:30.030> wire<00:01:30.240> action<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
really cool and the white wire action is

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
really cool and the white wire action is
actually<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.290> different<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
actually a lot more different in this so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
actually a lot more different in this so
were<00:01:33.360> saying<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.770> instead<00:01:35.159> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
were saying you know like instead of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.859 
were saying you know like instead of
spinning<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.509> over<00:01:36.780> your

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
spinning it you actually put over your

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.330 
spinning it you actually put over your
shoulder<00:01:37.259> type<00:01:37.439> action<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.979> it'll<00:01:38.130> clean

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
shoulder type action and it'll clean

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
shoulder type action and it'll clean
cool<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> definitely<00:01:39.659> recommend<00:01:39.900> making

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
cool so I definitely recommend making

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
cool so I definitely recommend making
these<00:01:40.439> stuffs<00:01:40.710> i<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:41.070> make<00:01:41.220> source<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.729> each

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
these stuffs i will make source for each

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880
