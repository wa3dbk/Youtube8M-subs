hold with the a shaped toward a major
shaped<00:03:40.480> cord<00:03:40.900> if<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.680> wanted<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.220> play<00:03:43.709> an<00:03:44.709> a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
shaped cord if I wanted to play an a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.800 
shaped cord if I wanted to play an a
major<00:03:45.250> as<00:03:45.610> an<00:03:45.790> open<00:03:46.090> chord<00:03:46.270> I'm<00:03:46.420> playing<00:03:46.690> it

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
major as an open chord I'm playing it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.270 
major as an open chord I'm playing it
down<00:03:47.110> here<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.800> move<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:48.700> up<00:03:49.170> one<00:03:50.170> fret<00:03:50.470> I've

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
down here I move it up one fret I've

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.670 
down here I move it up one fret I've
raised<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.880> root<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.360> semitone<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> b-flat

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
raised the root a semitone to a b-flat

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.820 
raised the root a semitone to a b-flat
major<00:03:54.150> I've<00:03:55.150> gotta<00:03:55.569> be<00:03:56.440> major<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:57.569> c-major<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:59.110> C

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
major I've gotta be major a c-major a C

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.140 
major I've gotta be major a c-major a C
sharp<00:04:00.280> major<00:04:00.610> and<00:04:01.060> addy<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:03.130> there's<00:04:03.970> two

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
sharp major and addy so there's two

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.370 
sharp major and addy so there's two
processes<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.690> go<00:04:04.810> through<00:04:05.019> when<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.170> try

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
processes you go through when you try

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.410 
processes you go through when you try
and<00:04:05.500> find<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.860> barre<00:04:06.430> chord<00:04:06.459> you've<00:04:07.269> got<00:04:07.360> to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
and find a barre chord you've got to

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.729 
and find a barre chord you've got to
identify<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.900> root<00:04:08.140> as<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:10.260> note<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.290> want

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
identify the root as the note you want

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.430 
identify the root as the note you want
so<00:04:12.280> if<00:04:12.459> I'm<00:04:12.610> trying<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.000> find<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.269> c-sharp<00:04:13.810> minor

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
so if I'm trying to find a c-sharp minor

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.920 
so if I'm trying to find a c-sharp minor
I've<00:04:14.830> got<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.069> find<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.340> c-sharp<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.090> then

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
I've got to find a c-sharp and then

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.750 
I've got to find a c-sharp and then
depending<00:04:17.620> on<00:04:17.769> whether<00:04:17.919> it's<00:04:18.100> an<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.340> string<00:04:18.669> or

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
depending on whether it's an a string or

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.069 
depending on whether it's an a string or
an<00:04:18.850> E<00:04:18.910> string<00:04:19.180> root<00:04:19.359> I've<00:04:19.570> got<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.750> put<00:04:19.930> down

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
an E string root I've got to put down

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.170 
an E string root I've got to put down
the<00:04:20.290> appropriate<00:04:20.829> shape<00:04:21.070> here<00:04:21.790> I've<00:04:21.970> got<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
the appropriate shape here I've got a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.719 
the appropriate shape here I've got a
c-sharp<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> string<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:24.220> want<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.550> c

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
c-sharp on the a string I want to c

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.120 
c-sharp on the a string I want to c
sharp<00:04:25.000> minor<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:26.080> I'm<00:04:26.169> going<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.380> put<00:04:26.440> down<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
sharp minor so I'm going to put down the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:39.740 
sharp minor so I'm going to put down the
a<00:04:27.160> minor<00:04:27.669> shape<00:04:28.710> gotta<00:04:29.710> c<00:04:29.950> sharp<00:04:30.130> minor

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.200 

okay<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:40.810> hopefully<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:42.460> now<00:04:42.670> understand<00:04:43.180> a

okay so hopefully you now understand a

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.900 
okay so hopefully you now understand a
little<00:04:43.360> bit<00:04:43.510> how<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.920> find<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.100> roots<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.639> bar

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
little bit how to find the roots of bar

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.670 
little bit how to find the roots of bar
chords<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.630> play<00:04:46.750> major<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.260> minor<00:04:47.410> Barre

and the a strings what I'm going to do

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.690 
and the a strings what I'm going to do
is<00:04:50.470> I'm<00:04:50.560> going<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.770> set<00:04:50.919> you<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.040> bit<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.430> test

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
is I'm going to set you a bit of a test

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.610 
is I'm going to set you a bit of a test
here<00:04:52.060> so<00:04:52.840> can<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.410> try<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:53.889> find<00:04:54.160> me<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.639> a

here so can you try and find me a a

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.100 
here so can you try and find me a a
minor<00:04:56.620> shaped<00:04:57.280> bar<00:04:57.880> chord<00:04:58.300> so<00:04:58.510> that's<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.750> minor

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
minor shaped bar chord so that's a minor

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.780 
minor shaped bar chord so that's a minor
bar<00:04:59.470> chord<00:04:59.500> or<00:04:59.919> its<00:05:00.040> root<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.639> string
