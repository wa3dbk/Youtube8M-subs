about them individually so let's start
off<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.729> fingerprints<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> top<00:02:09.330> of

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
off with the fingerprints at the top of

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.360 
off with the fingerprints at the top of
the<00:02:09.720> page<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.379> look<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> fingerprints

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the page if you look at the fingerprints

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.750 
the page if you look at the fingerprints
they're<00:02:11.940> there

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
they're there

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.220 
they're there
two<00:02:12.909> different<00:02:13.060> fingerprints<00:02:13.750> right<00:02:13.930> here

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
two different fingerprints right here

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.850 
two different fingerprints right here
and<00:02:14.409> one<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.430> them<00:02:15.550> says<00:02:15.849> no<00:02:16.180> match<00:02:16.390> found<00:02:16.860> now

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and one of them says no match found now

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.490 
and one of them says no match found now
I<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.879> have<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.299> feeling<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.019> one<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.409> these

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I I have a feeling that one of these

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.649 
I I have a feeling that one of these
fingerprints<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.220> actually<00:02:21.580> Stanley<00:02:22.120> Stan's

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
fingerprints is actually Stanley Stan's

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.080 
fingerprints is actually Stanley Stan's
twin<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.349> there<00:02:24.129> are<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.640> many<00:02:24.819> theories

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
twin and there are so many theories

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.270 
twin and there are so many theories
about<00:02:25.299> Stan<00:02:25.720> having<00:02:26.379> a<00:02:26.440> twin<00:02:26.680> it's<00:02:26.980> like

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
about Stan having a twin it's like

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.360 
about Stan having a twin it's like
really<00:02:27.819> it's<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.890> really<00:02:30.220> good

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
really it's just it's a really good

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.680 
really it's just it's a really good
theory<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.260> also<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.160> see<00:02:33.430> right<00:02:33.970> right

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
theory and also if you see right right

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.479 
theory and also if you see right right
behind<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.290> fingerprints<00:02:35.860> there's<00:02:36.129> a<00:02:36.220> map

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
behind the fingerprints there's a map

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.759 
behind the fingerprints there's a map
and<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.750> really<00:02:38.140> hard<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.470> see<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.680> this

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
and it's really hard to see in this

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.619 
and it's really hard to see in this
picture<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.220> got<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.579> watching<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
picture you got to watching the the

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.250 
picture you got to watching the the
actual<00:02:41.079> teaser<00:02:41.410> trailer<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.060> says<00:02:43.870> new

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
actual teaser trailer but it says new

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.630 
actual teaser trailer but it says new
jay<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.750> new<00:02:47.140> jay<00:02:47.530> actually<00:02:48.250> means<00:02:48.459> new

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
jay and that new jay actually means new

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.979 
jay and that new jay actually means new
jersey<00:02:49.090> because<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.569> see<00:02:49.720> from<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
jersey because you can see from the

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.470 
jersey because you can see from the
shape<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.470> state<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.730> he's<00:02:52.090> from<00:02:52.299> New

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
shape of the state that he's from New

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.039 
shape of the state that he's from New
Jersey

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
Jersey

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.650 
Jersey
so<00:02:53.920> we<00:02:54.459> knew<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.730> grunkle<00:02:55.239> Stan<00:02:55.420> was<00:02:55.510> from

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
so we knew that grunkle Stan was from

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900 
so we knew that grunkle Stan was from
New<00:02:55.780> Jersey<00:02:56.170> by<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.379> Jersey<00:02:56.890> vultures<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.400> one

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
New Jersey by the Jersey vultures in one

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.880 
New Jersey by the Jersey vultures in one
of<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> flashbacks<00:02:58.629> of<00:02:58.840> dreamscaperers<00:02:59.379> but

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
of the flashbacks of dreamscaperers but

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.640 
of the flashbacks of dreamscaperers but
this<00:03:00.069> just<00:03:00.310> basically<00:03:00.670> confirms<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.140> now<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
this just basically confirms it so now I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.500 
this just basically confirms it so now I
want<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:02.980> get<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.370> radioactive<00:03:03.790> barrels

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
want to get to the radioactive barrels

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.059 
want to get to the radioactive barrels
stolen<00:03:04.989> this<00:03:05.799> is<00:03:06.780> I've<00:03:07.780> made<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.349> original

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
stolen this is I've made a original

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.729 
stolen this is I've made a original
theory<00:03:09.459> they're<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.959> my<00:03:11.140> channel<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.590> made

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
theory they're like on my channel I made

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.400 
theory they're like on my channel I made
a<00:03:11.769> theory<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:13.030> apocalypse<00:03:13.510> upcoming

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
a theory that the apocalypse upcoming

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.830 
a theory that the apocalypse upcoming
was<00:03:14.590> gonna<00:03:14.739> be<00:03:14.950> nuclear<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.879> portal<00:03:16.329> was

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
was gonna be nuclear and the portal was

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.190 
was gonna be nuclear and the portal was
actually<00:03:17.380> powered<00:03:17.919> by<00:03:18.099> nuclear<00:03:18.489> power<00:03:18.579> and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
actually powered by nuclear power and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.440 
actually powered by nuclear power and
this<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.500> basically<00:03:21.040> proving<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.209> grunkle

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
this is basically proving that grunkle

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.099 
this is basically proving that grunkle
Stan<00:03:22.810> uses<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.819> radioactive<00:03:24.819> barrels<00:03:25.299> to

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
Stan uses the radioactive barrels to

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.440 
Stan uses the radioactive barrels to
actually<00:03:26.590> fuel<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.220> portal<00:03:27.669> and<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.269> is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
actually fuel the portal and this is

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.240 
actually fuel the portal and this is
really<00:03:28.630> interesting<00:03:28.840> because<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.560> puts<00:03:30.160> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
really interesting because it puts a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.680 
really interesting because it puts a
whole<00:03:30.430> new<00:03:30.459> perspective<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.239> what's<00:03:31.480> coming

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
whole new perspective on what's coming

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.809 
whole new perspective on what's coming
up<00:03:31.930> what's<00:03:32.200> gonna<00:03:32.380> happen<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.340> apocalypse

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
up what's gonna happen in the apocalypse

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.150 
up what's gonna happen in the apocalypse
and<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:34.900> think<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.380> was<00:03:35.530> really<00:03:35.919> cool

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and I just think that it was really cool

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.180 
and I just think that it was really cool
how<00:03:36.430> that's<00:03:36.970> actually<00:03:37.209> happening<00:03:37.810> now<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.200> as

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
how that's actually happening now and as

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.449 
how that's actually happening now and as
you<00:03:39.220> see<00:03:39.579> it<00:03:39.790> says<00:03:40.030> seismic<00:03:40.690> activity<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.650> we

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
you see it says seismic activity and we

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.789 
you see it says seismic activity and we
know<00:03:42.639> this<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.120> portal<00:03:43.569> shaking<00:03:44.500> around

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
know this is the portal shaking around

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.240 
know this is the portal shaking around
making<00:03:45.220> everything<00:03:45.609> shake<00:03:46.329> it's<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:47.530> seems

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
making everything shake it's it seems

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.710 
making everything shake it's it seems
like<00:03:48.519> it's<00:03:48.669> an<00:03:48.760> earthquake<00:03:49.209> that's<00:03:49.389> why<00:03:49.660> the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
like it's an earthquake that's why the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.289 
like it's an earthquake that's why the
government<00:03:50.049> agents<00:03:50.560> got<00:03:50.709> strange<00:03:51.669> signals

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
government agents got strange signals

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.710 
government agents got strange signals
and<00:03:52.630> if<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.799> see<00:03:54.099> this<00:03:54.280> report<00:03:54.730> card<00:03:55.060> there's

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and if you see this report card there's

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.039

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
now if you think about it does this

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.349 
now if you think about it does this

report card really reflects Stanford's
capabilities<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:09.180> does<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.329> really<00:04:10.750> feel

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
capabilities and does this really feel

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.490 
capabilities and does this really feel
like<00:04:11.109> Stan's<00:04:11.769> report<00:04:12.250> card<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:13.290> one<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.410> my

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
like Stan's report card I one of my

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.020 
like Stan's report card I one of my
theories<00:04:14.889> is<00:04:15.099> that<00:04:15.129> this<00:04:15.519> is<00:04:15.790> actually

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
theories is that this is actually

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.069 
theories is that this is actually
Stanley's<00:04:16.870> report<00:04:17.380> card<00:04:17.620> Stan's<00:04:18.250> twin

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
Stanley's report card Stan's twin

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.990 
Stanley's report card Stan's twin
because<00:04:20.079> all<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:21.159> evidence<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.729> we've

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
because all the evidence that we've

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.920 
because all the evidence that we've
gathered<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.719> the<00:04:22.870> past<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.469> that<00:04:24.159> Stanley

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
gathered in the past is that Stanley

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.830 
gathered in the past is that Stanley
is<00:04:25.110> actually<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> smarter<00:04:26.039> twin<00:04:26.340> he<00:04:27.180> he<00:04:27.720> was

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
is actually the smarter twin he he was

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.460 
is actually the smarter twin he he was
even<00:04:28.110> reading<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.740> book<00:04:29.600> during<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.990> wrestling

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
even reading a book during the wrestling

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.350 
even reading a book during the wrestling
match<00:04:31.650> in<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.009> dreamscaperers<00:04:32.550> flashback

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
match in the dreamscaperers flashback

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.710 
match in the dreamscaperers flashback
and<00:04:34.280> during<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.400> flashback<00:04:35.669> grunkle<00:04:36.449> Stan

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
and during that flashback grunkle Stan

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.520 
and during that flashback grunkle Stan
was<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.229> fighting<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.330> him<00:04:39.330> grunkle<00:04:40.320> Stan

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
was the one fighting so him grunkle Stan

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.230 
was the one fighting so him grunkle Stan
being<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> one<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.130> get<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.310> d-minus<00:04:42.060> in

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
being the one to get a d-minus in

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.050 
being the one to get a d-minus in
physical<00:04:42.900> education<00:04:42.990> would<00:04:43.650> just<00:04:43.860> be<00:04:44.060> it

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
physical education would just be it

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.850 
physical education would just be it
wouldn't<00:04:45.389> make<00:04:45.509> much<00:04:45.570> sense<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.320> we<00:04:46.710> know

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
wouldn't make much sense and we know

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.310 
wouldn't make much sense and we know
Stanley<00:04:47.250> is<00:04:47.610> really<00:04:47.940> smart<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.600> maybe<00:04:49.110> he's

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
Stanley is really smart so maybe he's

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.950 
Stanley is really smart so maybe he's
not<00:04:49.500> good<00:04:49.680> athletic<00:04:50.130> wise<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.669> this<00:04:51.539> is<00:04:51.720> just

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
not good athletic wise and this is just

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.680 
not good athletic wise and this is just
really<00:04:52.320> surprising<00:04:53.130> why<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:53.940> Stanley's

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
really surprising why is Stanley's

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.860 
really surprising why is Stanley's
report<00:04:55.380> card<00:04:55.590> there<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> don't<00:04:56.310> know<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:57.479> I

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
report card there I don't know but I

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.770 
report card there I don't know but I
just<00:04:58.680> know<00:04:58.919> it's<00:04:59.220> really<00:04:59.820> interesting<00:05:00.120> how

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
just know it's really interesting how

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.409 
just know it's really interesting how
this<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.229> all<00:05:01.380> coming<00:05:01.650> together<00:05:02.419> comment

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
this is all coming together comment

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.760 
this is all coming together comment
below<00:05:03.509> your<00:05:03.750> theories<00:05:04.199> on<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.530> stuff

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
below your theories on this stuff

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.890 
below your theories on this stuff
because<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.820> just<00:05:06.270> want<00:05:06.509> to<00:05:06.599> hear<00:05:06.720> what<00:05:06.810> you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
because I just want to hear what you

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.589 
because I just want to hear what you
guys<00:05:07.020> have<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.440> say<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.889> if<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:08.940> see<00:05:09.270> at<00:05:09.419> the

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
guys have to say and if you see at the

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.990 
guys have to say and if you see at the
very<00:05:09.960> edge<00:05:10.289> right<00:05:11.039> next<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> report<00:05:11.789> card

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
very edge right next to the report card

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.089 
very edge right next to the report card
there's<00:05:12.180> an<00:05:12.300> e<00:05:12.599> ly<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.440> can<00:05:13.590> probably<00:05:13.800> only

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
there's an e ly you can probably only

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.879 
there's an e ly you can probably only
see<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.370> ly<00:05:14.729> from<00:05:15.030> here<00:05:15.240> but<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.900> says<00:05:16.050> Aoi

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
see the ly from here but it says Aoi

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.890 
see the ly from here but it says Aoi
now<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.430> may<00:05:17.639> think<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:17.970> is<00:05:18.150> saying<00:05:18.360> Stanley

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
now you may think this is saying Stanley

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.330 
now you may think this is saying Stanley
but<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.259> really<00:05:19.650> don't<00:05:19.800> think<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.099> because

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
but I really don't think so because

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.879 
but I really don't think so because
that's<00:05:20.759> not<00:05:20.940> how<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.210> spell<00:05:21.360> Stanley<00:05:21.990> as<00:05:22.169> we

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
that's not how you spell Stanley as we

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.100 
that's not how you spell Stanley as we
have<00:05:23.190> theorized<00:05:23.699> so<00:05:24.419> that<00:05:24.660> probably<00:05:24.930> says

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
have theorized so that probably says

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.499 
have theorized so that probably says
likely<00:05:25.710> or<00:05:25.949> not<00:05:25.979> likely<00:05:26.280> or<00:05:26.910> something<00:05:27.389> like

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
likely or not likely or something like

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.529 
likely or not likely or something like
that<00:05:27.919> all<00:05:28.919> right<00:05:29.159> so<00:05:29.400> in<00:05:29.669> this<00:05:29.729> part<00:05:30.210> at<00:05:30.389> the

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
that all right so in this part at the

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.230 
that all right so in this part at the
end<00:05:30.570> of<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.930> teaser<00:05:31.250> gravity<00:05:32.250> is<00:05:32.430> literally

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
end of the teaser gravity is literally

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.629 
end of the teaser gravity is literally
falling<00:05:33.720> people<00:05:34.050> are<00:05:34.289> floating<00:05:34.770> up<00:05:34.949> gravity

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
falling people are floating up gravity

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.659 
falling people are floating up gravity
falls<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.380> it's<00:05:37.380> just<00:05:37.650> amazing<00:05:37.919> how<00:05:38.310> they<00:05:38.610> do

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
falls and it's just amazing how they do

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:39.200 
falls and it's just amazing how they do
this

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.290 
this
the<00:05:39.630> title<00:05:40.020> is<00:05:40.169> sho<00:05:40.349> gravity<00:05:40.800> falls<00:05:41.039> it's<00:05:41.970> been

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
the title is sho gravity falls it's been

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.149 
the title is sho gravity falls it's been
here<00:05:42.599> all<00:05:42.810> this<00:05:43.020> time<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:43.770> we've<00:05:43.889> never

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
here all this time and we've never

here all this time and we've never
noticed<00:05:44.820> all<00:05:45.330> right<00:05:45.539> so<00:05:45.690> that's<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.990> end<00:05:46.110> of

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
noticed all right so that's the end of
