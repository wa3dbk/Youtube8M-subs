00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.190
 with an image diagonal of almost 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.460
 this 65 inch version is one and a half meters 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.900
 from the hu 75 100 from samsung sincerely one 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.040
 large tv 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.439
 it is not just a TV 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.770
 namely also an ultra HD TV in 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.690
 able to play 4k material 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.279
 especially interesting for people who are horny 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.560
 on very sharp 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.480
 pictures but then you have to go hard 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.739
 looking because online is not that complete 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.989
 much to find 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.420
 samsung does not offer a 4k player itself 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.910
 one the current blu-ray players that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.130
 do not support 4k 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.899
 put first and unfortunately we can 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.660
 in this video not exactly the quality 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.149
 of ultra hd video showing simply because 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.340
 we record ourselves in full HD 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.200
 it is true that we are clear what online 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.719
 Have been able to find 4k test material 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.940
 to properly handle this TV 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.370
 well what is that a 4k material 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.129
 exactly that is actually ultra hd you would 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.629
 can say is 4 times full hd 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.740
 and that delivers incredibly sharp 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.780
 images on that also really bad 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.399
 be colorful 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.530
 no one really knows but believe 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.780
 you break that 4k faster and because 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.840
 we all think then this is hmm 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.929
 75 100 maybe a television 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.729
 for you because this ultra HD TV 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.250
 is perhaps not the most luxurious variant 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.929
 but he is very sophisticated about that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.390
 translates imagine these very 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.410
 rich in contrast are soft values are well 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.209
 all right 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.149
 and especially movements become reasonable 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.429
 smoothly displayed on this TV some pain 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.170
 tip is that the viewing angle of this 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.670
 TV and just like many flat TVs 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.130
 is not too big 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.700
 so look a bit at an angle on this screen 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.220
 then the colors quickly fade the hu 75 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.080
 100 from samsung is a luxury tv and that 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.520
 of course you see in the appearance 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.440
 and the design 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.200
 so the TV almost has your very thin 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.209
 minimalistic edges and the foot is allowed 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.149
 also being 10 sturdy and also nice 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.590
 designed that money less feeling the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.780
 remote control you get a whole 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.170
 functional remote control at that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.009
 this TV is almost worthy in design 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.000
 at the same time you also get a second one 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.590
 descent 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 what futuristic makes it possible 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.120
 to control your TV with a kind of mouse control 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.830
 to steer at the rear you find 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.050
 also numerous connections 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.820
 more than enough problem is if 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.230
 you put the TV on the wall that he 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.319
 connections are difficult to reach 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.319
 Yes 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.319
 It is almost like a 4k TV 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.239
 just seems like turning 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.459
 but you also of course that it too 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.170
 sound from this TV which is great 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.000
 luckily that's the case because because it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 screen is only so big it some more 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.870
 speakers in the approach 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.519
 even six and they deliver reasonably well 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.010
 detailed sound 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.950
 nice mid-low tones nice high tones 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.680
 not unworthy of your flat television 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.650
 the hu 75 100 from samsung is of course 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.480
 a full smart television if you have it 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 and you come with a push of a button 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.650
 you at the main screen that consists of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.540
 four separate screens of which we 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.730
 the logic escapes a bit from all 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.450
 as far as I am concerned one or two can 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.769
 to be 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.950
 well most important screen we are already 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.760
 a screen full of apps and there are 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.769
 too many to mention 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 what is a loss is that none 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.090
 special app is to store 4k content 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.250
 searching that of course had no more 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.840
 are on these ultra hd televisions 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.849
 maybe an update there 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.379
 brings improvement 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.569
 furthermore it strikes that the screen occasionally 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.769
 is a bit slow with construction 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.409
 that too is a shame because it is after all 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.870
 a luxury television of course you can do this 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.849
 also operate TV with an app 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.799
 so-called smart view then you can 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.269
 smartphone and tablet into one 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.919
 remote control and can even do video 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.669
 share with your TV 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.829
 we also have it 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.450
 energy consumption of these TVs tested 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.720
 that comes down to a standard situation 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.940
 about 192 what that means you're up 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.540
 spend around 40 euros on an annual basis 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.540
 energy 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.220
 after 75 100 from samsung is a nice one 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.390
 designed TV 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.520
 who also once a lot 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.080
 has smart options 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.110
 the TV is of course primarily one 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.100
 Ultra HD TV we can on your 4k content 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.490
 to play 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.680
 sorry already available tv is definitely not 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.780
 the most expensive but problem is that in the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.150
 mia d line even though devices are too 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.290
 find them that are much cheaper 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.850
 techniques are now so already heard what 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.000
 In that respect he scores at least 4 stars 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.300
 and with the hu 75 100 you seem ready 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.300
 the future
