I don't want to get up there on a ladder

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.200 
I don't want to get up there on a ladder
from<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.420> outside<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:16.130> did<00:01:16.789> a<00:01:16.820> little<00:01:17.000> bit

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
from the outside so I did a little bit

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.740 
from the outside so I did a little bit
of<00:01:17.330> framing<00:01:17.960> around<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:19.360> here's<00:01:20.360> my<00:01:20.509> piece

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
of framing around and here's my piece

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.120 
of framing around and here's my piece
because<00:01:21.229> it's<00:01:21.380> not<00:01:21.500> painted<00:01:21.800> so<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:21.950> have<00:01:22.039> to

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
because it's not painted so I have to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.719 
because it's not painted so I have to
paint<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.460> then<00:01:23.380> stick<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.440> in<00:01:24.649> and<00:01:25.399> I<00:01:25.520> think

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
paint it then stick it in and I think

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
paint it then stick it in and I think
I'm<00:01:25.820> good

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.780
