the same thing again okay so now you've
got<00:01:58.290> three<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> these<00:01:59.010> coils<00:01:59.510> so<00:02:00.510> we're<00:02:00.660> going

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
got three of these coils so we're going

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.960 
got three of these coils so we're going
to<00:02:00.900> this<00:02:01.050> we're<00:02:01.230> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.440> interlock<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:02.130> in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
to this we're going to interlock them in

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.040 
to this we're going to interlock them in
between<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.480> coils<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.770> together

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
between the coils to put them together

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.450 
between the coils to put them together
so<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.230> if<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.470> don't<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.770> doesn't<00:02:08.070> if<00:02:08.190> they

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
so and if they don't it doesn't if they

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.430 
so and if they don't it doesn't if they
don't<00:02:08.610> stay<00:02:08.910> together<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.750> well<00:02:09.960> then<00:02:10.320> you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
don't stay together that well then you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.410 
don't stay together that well then you
can<00:02:10.619> use<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.280> extra<00:02:11.580> piece<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.970> pipe<00:02:12.150> cleaner

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
can use the extra piece of pipe cleaner

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.809 
can use the extra piece of pipe cleaner
to<00:02:12.630> secure<00:02:13.020> it

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.190

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
so now you have something like this you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.490 
so now you have something like this you
can<00:02:26.830> see<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:34.239> next<00:02:34.450> thing<00:02:34.599> we'll<00:02:34.870> do<00:02:35.080> is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
can see that so next thing we'll do is

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.240 
can see that so next thing we'll do is
we're<00:02:35.890> going<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.190> attach<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.569> little<00:02:38.250> pieces

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
we're going to attach this little pieces

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.670 
we're going to attach this little pieces
of<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:40.360> pipe<00:02:40.569> cleaners<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.110> tip<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.530> what

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
of the pipe cleaners on the tip so what

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.540 
of the pipe cleaners on the tip so what
you'll<00:02:44.830> do

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
you'll do

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.699 
you'll do
oops<00:02:45.700> maybe<00:02:45.970> pull<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.420> out<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.750> little<00:02:46.930> bit<00:02:47.200> here

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
oops maybe pull it out a little bit here

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.539 
oops maybe pull it out a little bit here
and<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:49.319> kind<00:02:50.319> of<00:02:50.379> wrap<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.620> around

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
and just kind of wrap this around

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.470 
and just kind of wrap this around
I<00:02:52.530> think<00:02:53.530> I'll<00:02:53.620> poppy<00:02:54.280> move<00:02:55.150> down<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> little

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
I think I'll poppy move down a little

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.280 
I think I'll poppy move down a little
bit<00:02:55.780> lower<00:02:55.930> here<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:01.209> kind<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.569> twist<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
bit lower here it's kind of twist the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.440 
bit lower here it's kind of twist the
round<00:03:05.220> see<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.489> show<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.090> closer

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
round see if I can show you a closer

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.650 
round see if I can show you a closer
look<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.230> twisted<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.040> little

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
look here so I just twisted that little

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.809 
look here so I just twisted that little
piece<00:03:10.660> around<00:03:11.220> each<00:03:13.290> point

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
piece around each point

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.580 
piece around each point
okay<00:03:15.819> I'll<00:03:15.940> bet<00:03:16.120> snowflake<00:03:16.630> there<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.440> can

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
okay I'll bet snowflake there so you can

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.860 
okay I'll bet snowflake there so you can
see<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:18.360> okay<00:03:19.360> think<00:03:19.810> about<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.260> more

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.170 

number<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:26.170> kind<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:28.380> bending<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.609> these<00:03:30.609> and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
number just kind of bending it these and

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.979 
number just kind of bending it these and
twisting<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> around<00:03:32.130> each<00:03:33.269> snowflake<00:03:34.269> strand

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
twisting it around each snowflake strand

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.250 
twisting it around each snowflake strand
oops<00:03:36.000> okay<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:38.170> now<00:03:38.410> what<00:03:39.190> we've<00:03:39.340> got<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:40.260> this

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
oops okay so now what we've got is this

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.150 
oops okay so now what we've got is this
here<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.120> even<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:44.440> looks<00:03:44.620> fine<00:03:44.889> if<00:03:45.069> you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
here and even this it looks fine if you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.259 
here and even this it looks fine if you
want<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.400> leave<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> way<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.060> you've

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
want to leave it the way it is you've

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.599 
want to leave it the way it is you've
got<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.420> snowflake<00:03:46.810> there<00:03:47.200> but<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:47.980> added<00:03:48.370> a

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
got a snowflake there but I added a

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.550 
got a snowflake there but I added a
little<00:03:48.910> touch<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.540> pom-poms<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.139> between

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
little touch of the pom-poms in between

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.259 
little touch of the pom-poms in between
so<00:03:50.889> it<00:03:50.980> looks<00:03:51.130> like<00:03:51.280> it's<00:03:51.400> got<00:03:51.579> snow<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:54.269> so

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
so it looks like it's got snow so so

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.240 
so it looks like it's got snow so so
when<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.480> add<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.660> pom-pom<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.920> need<00:03:57.130> to

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
when you add a pom-pom you just need to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.530 
when you add a pom-pom you just need to
make<00:03:57.639> sure<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.750> put<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.079> glue<00:03:59.519> let's<00:04:00.519> see<00:04:00.790> in

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
make sure you put the glue let's see in

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.920 
make sure you put the glue let's see in
between<00:04:02.099> here<00:04:03.099> each<00:04:04.090> strand<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:07.120> I'm<00:04:07.690> using

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
between here each strand so I'm using

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.629 
between here each strand so I'm using
the<00:04:08.109> tacky<00:04:08.290> glue<00:04:08.530> because<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.099> know<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.459> works

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
the tacky glue because you know it works

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.970 
the tacky glue because you know it works
better<00:04:09.910> for<00:04:10.000> me<00:04:10.389> than<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.870> regular<00:04:11.650> school

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
better for me than the regular school

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:20.610 
better for me than the regular school
glue<00:04:14.519> just<00:04:15.519> put<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.940> pom-pom<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:16.720> between

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.750 

you<00:04:21.280> know<00:04:21.459> repeat<00:04:21.940> it's<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.570> same<00:04:22.900> thing<00:04:23.760> all

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
you know repeat it's the same thing all

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:35.310 
you know repeat it's the same thing all
the<00:04:24.820> way<00:04:25.030> around

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.010 

and<00:04:35.890> make<00:04:36.070> sure<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.460> set<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:36.850> down<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.240> dry<00:04:37.510> for

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and make sure you set it down to dry for

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.860 
and make sure you set it down to dry for
at<00:04:38.110> least<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.410> couple<00:04:38.440> hours<00:04:38.830> or<00:04:39.490> more<00:04:39.870> before

at least a couple hours or more before
you<00:04:40.990> hang<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.500> up<00:04:41.650> on<00:04:41.830> their<00:04:42.070> tree<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:44.110> can

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
you hang it up on their tree you can

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.910 
you hang it up on their tree you can
just<00:04:44.470> use<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> string<00:04:45.900> any<00:04:46.900> string<00:04:48.090> will<00:04:49.090> do<00:04:49.920> you

want to make an ornament out of it it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.300 
want to make an ornament out of it it
actually<00:04:55.660> stays<00:04:56.170> on<00:04:56.410> put<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.920> tree<00:04:57.130> if<00:04:57.190> you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
actually stays on put on the tree if you

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.980 
actually stays on put on the tree if you
just<00:04:57.460> set<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.840> in<00:04:58.840> between<00:04:58.990> the<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.750> tree

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
just set it in between the the tree

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.770 
just set it in between the the tree
branches<00:05:03.210> or<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:06.310> leaves<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:07.540> guard

Douglas<00:05:08.110> for<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.350> Christmas<00:05:08.680> tree<00:05:08.920> of<00:05:09.280> course

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.630

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
okay so that's it so you've got a

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.380 
okay so that's it so you've got a
snowflake<00:05:25.120> that's<00:05:25.390> got<00:05:25.680> six<00:05:26.970> almost<00:05:27.970> equal

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
snowflake that's got six almost equal

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.920 
snowflake that's got six almost equal
points<00:05:31.390> or<00:05:31.540> sides<00:05:32.760> but<00:05:33.760> let<00:05:34.420> me<00:05:34.510> grab<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.810> one

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
points or sides but let me grab the one

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.570 
points or sides but let me grab the one
I<00:05:34.960> already<00:05:35.260> made<00:05:35.710> before<00:05:36.070> so<00:05:36.100> that's<00:05:36.310> why<00:05:36.490> it's

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
I already made before so that's why it's

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.510 
I already made before so that's why it's
already<00:05:36.790> dried<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.860> here's<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.250> other<00:05:39.280> one

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
already dried so here's the other one
