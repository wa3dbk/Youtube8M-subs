00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.250
 I believe that Mexico will reach the 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.570
 end I do not know yet playing horrible is going to 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.940
 get to the final 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.940
 you think it's the wide favorite 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.830
 I think in Panama 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.660
 the Costa Rica itself is up 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.130
 favorites that mexico is not mexico is in 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 four united states 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 is all tense right now if it's going to happen to 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:48.690
 semifinals because everyone 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.289
 it is truly a misery 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.180
 football with a tournament that takes two 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.100
 four weeks have been eliminated 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.870
 equipucho pool are four teams and 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.519
 now it starts with the fourth pillar until the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.780
 force but it will complicate not here 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.410
 it's going to get complicated in the next 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.000
 match 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.950
 that's where you can eliminate it before 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.540
 I had and still have it with you know 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.490
 the doctor's winner is very simple 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.619
 trinidad is accompanied by panama cuba 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.990
 those will play in dallas as a match 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.850
 stellar and as a preliminary game the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.439
 winner of honduras costa rica contraer 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.090
 and adores the united states in the savior of 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.890
 once I tell you usa costa rica mexico 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.570
 Panama are semi the end 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.759
 known mexico in the end win 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.420
 mexico usa with goal of the valenzuela mole 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.420
 in corner kick 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:37.250
 to see again here but that is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.290
 aware that it's going to happen and it's going to 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.210
 start until the day what I'm going 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.190
 a is that the gold cup if there is 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.500
 consider and we will analyze it more to 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.840
 depth at night that mexico by 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.550
 first time after many years 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.070
 is not the favorite to win the cup or 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.380
 Lorena is not the favorite that is in 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.030
 great risks of not participating in the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.840
 confederations cup that is going to play 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.240
 in russia I imagine that in russia the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 next because it 's all half ticket 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.890
 what's up with the next gold cup going 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.450
 starting the process we are 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.520
 damn the idea we a lethality 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 is that what I'm going to do can be you 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 rafa technicians who go to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.400
 run 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.140
 better after Brazil we will run 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.580
 going to open a new technician is one 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.710
 technician is going to have his first big tournament 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.000
 like the gold cup if you do not win it anymore 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.410
 have benefit and queue with for 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.630
 homeless comparisons is like 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.060
 comparisons mexico I have risk 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.870
 all not to go before the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.790
 contractions of music yes yes yes but I 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.220
 I think Mexico is a technical colossus and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.080
 even with anything mexico is going to be 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.490
 always the favorite not in this tournament in 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.140
 the one that follows I think that going back to mexico 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.700
 is the favorite purchase in which the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.959
 better than it's going to be since guarantees 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.270
 you can give us what seems like the favorite 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.430
 same mexico does not go to the world cup 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.930
 of this regime may be worse than with 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.540
 the chepo of the tower 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.800
 because it can always be worse is that I 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.140
 I think it's the lowest thing that's happened 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.370
 with mexico to have doubts that mexico 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.620
 will reach the Mexican national team and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.290
 we have the selection in the players 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.150
 they were used of a cow a baseness 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.150
 terrible to take us to the wall 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.830
 the statements but the statements 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.600
 of these men 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.600
 we have to make the equipment 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.910
 are saying that this team can 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.920
 win the gold cup good there is no 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.840
 you can win the homeless gold cup the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.430
 buyer is a great failure grandfather and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.990
 do the third and will continue to fail 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.970
 elche was the tower and they will not run 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.880
 in that goal put by themselves 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.550
 the one of the 20 does not have anything damn the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.220
 fault of the fiasco but go 3 clear to 3 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.650
 the cup of nations in the of the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.650
 sub-20 selection was in that box 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.440
 why the fuck does it have to do with what 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.360
 serious not for that but it's in that box 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.620
 of objectives was the sub 20 for 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.620
 perhaps this cooperation 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.420
 was not gerardo is stipulated but it is 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.280
 the biggest failure in the history of the 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.260
 Mexican soccer that in three games in 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.660
 the Aztec stadium a knockout not 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:32.110
 goals a single goal with this is so that 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:32.110
 they would have run it in the night
