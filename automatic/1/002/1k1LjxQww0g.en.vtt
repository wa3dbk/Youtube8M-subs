see here I've got some things up here at
the<00:00:27.599> top<00:00:27.840> some<00:00:28.080> selections<00:00:29.029> I'm<00:00:30.029> gonna<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the top some selections I'm gonna take a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.740 
the top some selections I'm gonna take a
look<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:31.050> fuel<00:00:31.500> system<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.329> let's<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.600> say

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
look at fuel system and let's just say

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
look at fuel system and let's just say
for<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> sake<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> discussion<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
for the sake of discussion that this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
for the sake of discussion that this
vehicle<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.760> brought<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.989> shop<00:00:37.260> here

it<00:00:37.950> wouldn't<00:00:38.340> start<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.570> am<00:00:39.930> suspecting

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it wouldn't start and I am suspecting

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.319 
it wouldn't start and I am suspecting
that<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.920> may<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> problem<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> fuel

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that I may have a problem with the fuel

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.590 
that I may have a problem with the fuel
pump<00:00:42.800> if<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.219> fuel<00:00:44.489> system<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
pump if I go into fuel system here and

then<00:00:46.230> click<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:47.420> fuel<00:00:48.420> pump<00:00:48.719> relay<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.500> up

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
then click on fuel pump relay here up

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.819 
then click on fuel pump relay here up
here<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> top<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.320> I've<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.649> the

everything in the relay and everything
for<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> system<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.299> good<00:01:12.540> condition<00:01:12.750> I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
for this system are in good condition I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.280 
for this system are in good condition I
should<00:01:13.860> hear<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.369> pump<00:01:14.869> operating<00:01:18.290> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
should hear that pump operating and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.920 
should hear that pump operating and
right<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:20.100> hear<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> pump<00:01:20.580> running<00:01:20.930> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
right now I can hear the pump running so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
right now I can hear the pump running so
I'm<00:01:22.020> gonna<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.320> ahead<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to
select<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.530> over

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
select off and if you take a look over

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.200 
select off and if you take a look over
here<00:01:25.830> you'll<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> Sabattus<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
here you'll see the Sabattus in this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
here you'll see the Sabattus in this
case<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.810> select<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
case if I select on there now you can

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.310 
case if I select on there now you can
hear<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> pump<00:01:30.210> running<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> status<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
hear the pump running with the status on

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
hear the pump running with the status on
and<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.729> we'll<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:32.970> ahead<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> we'll<00:01:33.420> turn

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and then we'll go ahead and we'll turn

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.929 
and then we'll go ahead and we'll turn
it<00:01:33.720> off<00:01:33.869> again<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.100> since<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.640> hear

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it off again and so since I can hear

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.569 
it off again and so since I can hear
that<00:01:36.090> pump<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.979> case<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that pump I know that in this case the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
that pump I know that in this case the
wiring<00:01:39.060> must<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.360> working<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.049> enough<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
wiring must be working well enough to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.620 
wiring must be working well enough to
make<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.860> pump<00:01:41.159> operate<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.240> order<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
make that pump operate in order to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.300 
make that pump operate in order to
determine<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.170> I've<00:01:43.320> got<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> bad<00:01:43.770> fuel<00:01:44.040> pump

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
determine if I've got a bad fuel pump

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
determine if I've got a bad fuel pump
I'm<00:01:44.490> still<00:01:44.700> gonna<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> few<00:01:45.630> more

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I'm still gonna have to do a few more

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
I'm still gonna have to do a few more
tests<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:47.100> pressure<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.939> flow<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
tests with pressure and flow and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
tests with pressure and flow and
possibly<00:01:49.049> current<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> confirm<00:01:50.040> whether<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
possibly current to confirm whether it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.700 
possibly current to confirm whether it
is<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:51.000> isn't<00:01:51.149> working<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.259> least<00:01:52.380> at<00:01:52.590> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
is or isn't working but at least at this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
is or isn't working but at least at this
point<00:01:53.100> I've<00:01:53.280> done<00:01:53.549> some<00:01:53.909> simple<00:01:54.119> testing<00:01:54.630> from

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
point I've done some simple testing from

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
point I've done some simple testing from
the<00:01:55.320> driver's<00:01:55.799> seat<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:57.000> scan<00:01:57.299> tool

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the driver's seat here with my scan tool

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
the driver's seat here with my scan tool
to<00:01:57.840> determine<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> eliminate<00:01:59.130> some<00:01:59.340> things

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
to determine and eliminate some things

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.149 
to determine and eliminate some things
such<00:01:59.850> as<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.240> wiring<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> relay<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.040> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
such as the wiring and the relay in this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.649 
such as the wiring and the relay in this
case<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.000> fuel<00:02:03.240> pump<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
case to see if my fuel pump is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.140 
case to see if my fuel pump is
functioning
