awesome<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.439> eight-year<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.829> key

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
awesome so I think an eight-year a key

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
awesome so I think an eight-year a key
card<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.369> desert<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.180> guy<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.420> also

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
card is desert there's this guy is also

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
card is desert there's this guy is also
linked<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> move<00:01:31.710> possibly<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> Saudi

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
linked with a move possibly to the Saudi

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.480 
linked with a move possibly to the Saudi
League<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.320> happens<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.310> would

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
League so if that happens that would

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.140 
League so if that happens that would
suck<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.689> also<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.610> possible

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
suck but also I don't know for possible

getting<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.630> bit<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.740> age<00:02:05.009> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040

stuff<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.180> i<00:02:06.240> still<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.659> we're

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
stuff like that but i still think we're

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.540 
stuff like that but i still think we're
going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.530> good<00:02:07.680> card<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.129> he

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
going to see a pretty good card as he

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.760 
going to see a pretty good card as he
gains<00:02:08.759> another<00:02:09.090> year<00:02:09.420> older<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.379> EA<00:02:10.560> all

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
gains another year older I think EA all

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.200 
gains another year older I think EA all
probably<00:02:11.039> dropping<00:02:11.340> by<00:02:11.580> another<00:02:11.849> bit<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> pace

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
but even so like 66 pace on his FIFA 16

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.390 
but even so like 66 pace on his FIFA 16

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.310 
good on the ball five-star skill moves
of<00:03:27.790> course<00:03:28.180> we<00:03:28.510> all<00:03:28.660> know<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.020> think

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
of course we all know that I think

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.590 
of course we all know that I think
there's<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.530> noose<00:03:29.710> or<00:03:29.950> bellotti<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.730> skill

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
there's a noose or bellotti and skill

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
there's a noose or bellotti and skill
move<00:03:31.810> coming<00:03:32.080> in<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.380> feed<00:03:32.470> for<00:03:32.650> 16<00:03:33.040> as<00:03:33.220> well

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
move coming in and feed for 16 as well

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.400 
move coming in and feed for 16 as well
so<00:03:33.700> pretty<00:03:34.240> sure<00:03:34.450> it's<00:03:34.630> gonna<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:34.900> five<00:03:35.140> star

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
so pretty sure it's gonna have five star

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.530 
so pretty sure it's gonna have five star
skill<00:03:35.680> moves<00:03:36.000> definitely<00:03:37.000> deserves<00:03:37.360> them

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
the season card which is pretty much the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.140 
the season card which is pretty much the
highest<00:04:14.830> rated<00:04:15.100> cardies<00:04:15.400> ever<00:04:15.610> had<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.000> think

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
highest rated cardies ever had I think

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.060 
highest rated cardies ever had I think
and<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.350> he's<00:04:17.500> obviously<00:04:17.710> doing<00:04:17.920> something

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
and so he's obviously doing something

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.130 
and so he's obviously doing something
right<00:04:18.460> oh<00:04:18.790> yeah<00:04:18.970> he<00:04:19.180> just<00:04:19.299> boosted<00:04:19.540> him<00:04:19.870> for

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
right oh yeah he just boosted him for

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.780 
right oh yeah he just boosted him for
for<00:04:20.590> no<00:04:20.680> apparent<00:04:21.040> reason<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:21.460> we<00:04:21.549> all<00:04:21.669> know

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
for no apparent reason but we all know

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.340 
for no apparent reason but we all know
that's<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.210> case<00:04:22.300> scoring<00:04:22.930> goals<00:04:23.080> left

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
that's not the case scoring goals left

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.350 
that's not the case scoring goals left
right<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.680> center<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.460> think<00:04:24.820> he<00:04:25.030> will<00:04:25.240> be

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
right and center I do think he will be

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.990 
right and center I do think he will be
dropped

age happens ebrahim it older I think he

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.590

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
but the saving grace for this is in my

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.540 
but the saving grace for this is in my
opinion<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:39.020> think<00:04:39.050> they<00:04:39.410> will<00:04:39.740> upgrade<00:04:39.950> him<00:04:40.370> to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
opinion I think they will upgrade him to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.180 
opinion I think they will upgrade him to

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
going to be a force task killer and we

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.140 
going to be a force task killer and we
were<00:04:51.230> all<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> little<00:04:51.440> bit<00:04:51.710> mad<00:04:51.890> i<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.190> especially

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
were all a little bit mad i I especially

were all a little bit mad i I especially
was<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.720> but<00:04:54.590> i<00:04:55.010> think<00:04:55.460> this<00:04:55.550> year<00:04:55.610> they'll

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
was and but i think this year they'll

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.490 
was and but i think this year they'll
boost<00:04:56.150> him<00:04:56.330> back<00:04:56.480> up<00:04:56.660> this<00:04:56.900> face<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.410> he

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
boost him back up this face it he

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.470 
boost him back up this face it he
definitely<00:04:57.920> deserves<00:04:58.490> five-star<00:04:59.150> skill

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480

moves he pulls stuff up in game which i
don't<00:05:02.570> think<00:05:02.780> any<00:05:02.930> other<00:05:03.140> player<00:05:03.410> can<00:05:03.650> really

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
don't think any other player can really

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.460

do<00:05:04.130> he's<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.400> god<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.000> i<00:05:05.360> think<00:05:05.600> even<00:05:05.750> an<00:05:05.930> 89

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
do he's a god and i think even an 89

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.200 
do he's a god and i think even an 89
right<00:05:06.680> into<00:05:06.950> that<00:05:07.040> an<00:05:07.250> if<00:05:07.520> as<00:05:07.880> long<00:05:07.970> as<00:05:08.090> he's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
right into that an if as long as he's

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
to be epic in FIFA 16 and things like

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.220 
to be epic in FIFA 16 and things like
pace<00:05:12.740> might<00:05:13.220> might<00:05:13.820> drop<00:05:14.270> just<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.810> little<00:05:14.990> bit

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230
