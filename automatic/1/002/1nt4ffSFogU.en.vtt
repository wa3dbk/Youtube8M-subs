ring because that's what i used it for
but<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.020> anywhere<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.469> body<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but this can go anywhere your body so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
when I say lip ring I mean anything okay

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
when I say lip ring I mean anything okay
so<00:00:59.579> here's<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> ring<00:01:00.239> looks<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so here's what the ring looks like and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
so here's what the ring looks like and
basically<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.680> way<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> works<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
basically the way it works is that you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
basically the way it works is that you
pull<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> hinge<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.500> let<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
pull the hinge right here and you let it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.660 
pull the hinge right here and you let it
go<00:01:05.549> hopefully<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:08.189> pull

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
go hopefully you can see that you pull

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
go hopefully you can see that you pull
it<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> pops<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.140> up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it down right there and it pops back up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
it down right there and it pops back up
so<00:01:10.890> basically<00:01:11.250> that's<00:01:11.430> Kyle's<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> go

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so basically that's Kyle's going to go

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.820 
so basically that's Kyle's going to go
on<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.390> lip<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> already

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
on your lip and as you can see I already

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340

have<00:01:14.159> my<00:01:14.400> real<00:01:14.790> ring<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.229> it

I'm<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> demonstrate<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> side<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
I'm going to demonstrate on this side so

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
I'm going to demonstrate on this side so
basically<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.710> take<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.880> on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
basically you just take this you on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.050 
basically you just take this you on
squeeze<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.520> goes<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.820> very

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
squeeze it on to it and it goes on very

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
squeeze it on to it and it goes on very
easily<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.930> doesn't<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.320> practice<00:01:25.799> that's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
easily that doesn't take practice that's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
easily that doesn't take practice that's
just<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.369> easy<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.939> um<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.979> if

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
just how easy it is um I don't know if

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
just how easy it is um I don't know if
these<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.250> centered<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
these are centered or not because I have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
these are centered or not because I have
a<00:01:30.810> mirror<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.530> hopefully<00:01:31.829> looks<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.189> have

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
a mirror but hopefully looks like i have

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.319 
a mirror but hopefully looks like i have
spider<00:01:32.610> bites<00:01:32.880> spider<00:01:33.570> bites<00:01:33.840> snake<00:01:34.200> bites<00:01:34.439> um

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
spider bites spider bites snake bites um

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.580 
spider bites spider bites snake bites um
but<00:01:36.329> yeah<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:36.810> simple<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
but yeah that's how simple it is so you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.940 
but yeah that's how simple it is so you
can<00:01:37.680> scoot<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> over<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.930> have<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> labret<00:01:40.409> they

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
can scoot it over and have a labret they

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.889 
can scoot it over and have a labret they
come<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.280> different<00:01:41.430> sizes<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:42.119> clearly

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
come in different sizes because clearly

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.170 
come in different sizes because clearly
this<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.770> too<00:01:44.610> small<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this is a little bit too small for a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.960 
this is a little bit too small for a
labret<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.750> massage<00:01:46.079> slip<00:01:46.409> um<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> also

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
labret for massage slip um the and also

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.240 
labret for massage slip um the and also
this<00:01:48.299> could<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:49.500> friend<00:01:49.649> try<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> use<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this could be my friend try to use and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.679 
this could be my friend try to use and
she<00:01:50.310> has<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.549> thin<00:01:50.670> lips<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.509> looked

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
she has very thin lips and it looked

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
she has very thin lips and it looked
crazy<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.259> she<00:01:53.130> has<00:01:53.220> released<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.670> lips

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
crazy because she has released my lips

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.340 
crazy because she has released my lips
in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> Rings<00:01:54.390> are<00:01:54.540> too<00:01:54.630> big<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.140> have

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
in the Rings are too big so they do have

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
in the Rings are too big so they do have
different<00:01:55.470> sizes<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.060> good<00:01:57.570> thing<00:01:57.600> about

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
different sizes but the good thing about

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.020 
different sizes but the good thing about
these<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.430> literally<00:01:59.670> put<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
these is that you can literally put this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
these is that you can literally put this
anywhere<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.540> body<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
anywhere in your body so you can have it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
anywhere in your body so you can have it
as<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.159> septum<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.939> nose<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.540> your<00:02:03.990> car

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
as your septum on your nose on your car

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.500 
as your septum on your nose on your car
lift<00:02:04.469> somewhere<00:02:04.860> um

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
lift somewhere um

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.810 
lift somewhere um
yeah<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.380> go<00:02:07.500> anywhere<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.460> want<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
yeah I can go anywhere that you want it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.140 
yeah I can go anywhere that you want it
to<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.900> to<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.320> how<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.880> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to go just to see how you know that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.780 
to go just to see how you know that
potential<00:02:12.810> Pearson<00:02:13.140> would<00:02:13.260> look<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.160> for

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
potential Pearson would look like so for

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.820 
potential Pearson would look like so for
me<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.120> originally<00:02:15.630> got<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.200> before<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
me I originally got it before I got the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
me I originally got it before I got the
lip<00:02:17.010> actually<00:02:17.460> done<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.880> I'm<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.930> so

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
lip actually done and I'm so so so

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.860 
lip actually done and I'm so so so
thankful<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.890> got<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.750> first<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
thankful that I got it because first of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.230 
thankful that I got it because first of
all<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.320> super<00:02:22.590> cheap<00:02:22.620> two<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:23.880> things

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
all it's super cheap two of these things

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.440 
all it's super cheap two of these things
for<00:02:24.660> 699<00:02:25.200> or<00:02:25.560> 599<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.460> three<00:02:26.700> dollars<00:02:27.000> each<00:02:27.210> if

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
for 699 or 599 so three dollars each if

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.030 
for 699 or 599 so three dollars each if
there<00:02:27.630> was<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.870> separately<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.590> that's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
there was so separately and that's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.070 
there was so separately and that's
really<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.550> good<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.960> know<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
really really good because you know a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.440 
really really good because you know a
real<00:02:31.200> lip<00:02:31.590> ring<00:02:31.830> by<00:02:32.070> itself<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:33.090> way<00:02:33.420> more

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
real lip ring by itself is more way more

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.810 
real lip ring by itself is more way more
than<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.140> I'm<00:02:34.710> really<00:02:35.040> glad<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.580> that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
than so I'm really glad that I got that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.900 
than so I'm really glad that I got that
but<00:02:36.390> more<00:02:36.780> importantly<00:02:37.230> um<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:38.340> could<00:02:38.820> have

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
but more importantly um I could have

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.120 
but more importantly um I could have
made<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:39.300> bad<00:02:39.450> decision<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:40.140> getting<00:02:41.040> it

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
made a really bad decision of getting it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.680 
made a really bad decision of getting it
Pierce<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.580> bright<00:02:41.880> side<00:02:41.910> because<00:02:42.510> that's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
Pierce on the bright side because that's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.540 
Pierce on the bright side because that's
what<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> had<00:02:43.140> him<00:02:43.260> envisioned<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.100> was<00:02:44.460> like

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
what I had him envisioned I was like

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.590 
what I had him envisioned I was like
okay<00:02:44.760> I'm<00:02:44.850> gonna<00:02:44.940> give<00:02:45.090> done<00:02:45.300> on<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> right

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
okay I'm gonna give done on the right

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.510 
okay I'm gonna give done on the right
side<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.890> thought<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.310> what

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
side just because I thought that's what

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.460 
side just because I thought that's what
we'll<00:02:47.670> look<00:02:47.760> cute<00:02:48.060> without<00:02:48.300> ever<00:02:48.720> trying<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
we'll look cute without ever trying it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
we'll look cute without ever trying it
out<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> once<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.610> wore<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.300> quickly

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
out and once I wore it I quickly

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080 
out and once I wore it I quickly
realized<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.070> right<00:02:53.250> side<00:02:53.490> just<00:02:53.760> didn't

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
realized that the right side just didn't

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.520 
realized that the right side just didn't
suit<00:02:54.300> me<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.570> don't<00:02:54.930> know<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.200> didn't<00:02:55.380> look<00:02:55.470> good

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it was awkward and weird but the left

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.890 
it was awkward and weird but the left
side<00:02:58.770> looks<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.130> natural<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.270> really

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900

cute so I've one on the left side you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.590 
cute so I've one on the left side you
know<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> war<00:03:04.650> as<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:06.060> see<00:03:06.240> which<00:03:06.450> I

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
left it on which I figured out too
