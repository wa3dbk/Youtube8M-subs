00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.499 

now<00:00:02.500> we're<00:00:02.680> going<00:00:02.830> to<00:00:02.920> learn<00:00:03.130> how<00:00:04.090> to<00:00:04.120> build

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:04.509 
now we're going to learn how to build

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.890 
now we're going to learn how to build
rhythm<00:00:05.230> patterns<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:07.000> first<00:00:07.240> one<00:00:07.540> that<00:00:07.780> I'm

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
rhythm patterns the first one that I'm

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.289 
rhythm patterns the first one that I'm
going<00:00:07.930> to<00:00:08.109> start<00:00:08.349> with<00:00:08.610> involves<00:00:09.610> playing<00:00:09.969> a

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
going to start with involves playing a

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.049 
going to start with involves playing a
single<00:00:11.259> bass<00:00:11.410> note<00:00:11.709> and<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:12.429> chord<00:00:12.730> in<00:00:12.940> the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
single bass note and a chord in the

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.690 
single bass note and a chord in the
right<00:00:13.240> hand<00:00:13.599> we're<00:00:14.469> going<00:00:14.589> to<00:00:14.650> use<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:15.039> note<00:00:15.219> C

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
right hand we're going to use the note C

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.019 
right hand we're going to use the note C
and<00:00:16.410> then<00:00:17.410> we're<00:00:17.590> gonna<00:00:17.710> play<00:00:18.010> over<00:00:18.699> here

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
and then we're gonna play over here

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.439 
and then we're gonna play over here
we're<00:00:19.390> gonna<00:00:19.510> form<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:19.960> C<00:00:20.170> minor<00:00:20.410> seven<00:00:21.449> like

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
we're gonna form a C minor seven like

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.560 
we're gonna form a C minor seven like
that<00:00:23.460> okay<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.640> so<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.060> shape<00:00:25.269> that<00:00:25.300> I'm

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
that okay and so the shape that I'm

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.359 
that okay and so the shape that I'm
playing<00:00:25.839> in<00:00:26.019> the<00:00:26.140> right<00:00:26.320> hand<00:00:26.679> is<00:00:26.890> basically

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
playing in the right hand is basically

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.970 
playing in the right hand is basically
taking<00:00:27.669> a<00:00:27.759> C<00:00:27.939> minor<00:00:28.179> chord<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:29.169> flatting<00:00:29.949> the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
taking a C minor chord and flatting the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.860 
taking a C minor chord and flatting the
third<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:31.359> it's<00:00:31.480> an<00:00:31.599> E<00:00:31.749> flat<00:00:31.929> major<00:00:32.259> triad<00:00:33.870> okay

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
third or it's an E flat major triad okay

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.619 
third or it's an E flat major triad okay
so<00:00:35.620> we're<00:00:35.710> going<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.860> take<00:00:36.039> these<00:00:36.280> two<00:00:36.629> chords

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
so we're going to take these two chords

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.889 
so we're going to take these two chords
and<00:00:37.780> build<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.140> rhythmic<00:00:38.500> pattern<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.719> learn

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
and build a rhythmic pattern to learn

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.720 
and build a rhythmic pattern to learn
the<00:00:41.050> rhythm<00:00:41.320> pattern<00:00:41.469> I<00:00:41.800> basically<00:00:42.309> learn<00:00:42.550> the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
the rhythm pattern I basically learn the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.299 
the rhythm pattern I basically learn the
events<00:00:43.329> sort<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.350> like<00:00:44.469> the<00:00:44.649> way<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.829> drummer

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
events sort of like the way a drummer

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.849 
events sort of like the way a drummer
would<00:00:45.550> do<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:45.910> I<00:00:46.090> think<00:00:46.899> of<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.170> like<00:00:47.199> this<00:00:47.649> I

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
would do it I think of it like this I

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.369 
would do it I think of it like this I
would<00:00:48.129> play<00:00:48.309> both<00:00:48.520> parts<00:00:48.789> together<00:00:49.420> at<00:00:50.289> the

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
would play both parts together at the

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.979 
would play both parts together at the
same<00:00:50.620> time<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.370> then<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.270> next<00:00:52.539> part<00:00:52.719> would

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
same time and then the next part would

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.420 
same time and then the next part would
be<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.260> right<00:00:53.440> hand<00:00:53.879> left<00:00:54.879> hand

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
be the right hand left hand

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.720 
be the right hand left hand
and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.120> hand<00:00:57.330> twice<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.610> that's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and then the right hand twice so that's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
and then the right hand twice so that's
the<00:00:59.970> first<00:01:00.210> part<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.630> it<00:01:00.810> so<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.320> would<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.650> like

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the first part of it so it would go like

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.250 
the first part of it so it would go like
this<00:01:01.950> you<00:01:02.490> play<00:01:02.700> both<00:01:02.880> together

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.770 

and<00:01:09.100> then<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.400> add<00:01:09.550> to<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.180> finish<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.600> off

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
and then to add to that to finish it off

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.890 
and then to add to that to finish it off
we're<00:01:11.650> gonna<00:01:11.740> play<00:01:12.070> left<00:01:12.790> right<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.750> means

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
we're gonna play left right that means

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020 
we're gonna play left right that means
the<00:01:14.170> base<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.740> then<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.980> corn<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:15.580> in<00:01:15.760> slow

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
the base and then the corn so in slow

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.640 
the base and then the corn so in slow
motion<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.570> looks<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.960> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 

if<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.760> have<00:01:23.850> any<00:01:24.000> trouble<00:01:24.450> playing<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.050> on

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
if you have any trouble playing it on

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.750 
if you have any trouble playing it on
the<00:01:25.290> instrument<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.070> you're<00:01:26.370> working<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
the instrument because you're working on

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.700 
the instrument because you're working on
your<00:01:26.910> fingering<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.690> you're<00:01:27.960> beginning<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
your fingering if you're beginning you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
your fingering if you're beginning you
can<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> same<00:01:29.250> thing<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.760> on<00:01:29.970> your

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
can do the same thing with your on your

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.190 
can do the same thing with your on your
legs<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.990> play<00:01:31.200> both<00:01:32.180> right<00:01:33.180> left<00:01:33.630> right

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
legs you just play both right left right

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.620 
legs you just play both right left right
right<00:01:34.440> left<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.240> practice

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
right left right and you just practice

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.960 
right left right and you just practice
with<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.900> hands<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.620> rhythm<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.820> can

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
with your hands as a rhythm and you can

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550 
with your hands as a rhythm and you can
do<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> without<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.660> stick<00:01:39.930> too<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.440> if

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
do that without the stick too so if

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260 
do that without the stick too so if
you're<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.890> learning<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.150> way

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you're just learning that's a good way

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.820 
you're just learning that's a good way
to<00:01:42.330> get<00:01:42.540> started<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.080> get<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> rhythm<00:01:43.680> going

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
to get started to get the rhythm going

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.280 
to get started to get the rhythm going
and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.610> eventually<00:01:44.910> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.450> translate<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and then eventually you can translate it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.110 
and then eventually you can translate it
over<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> instrument<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.580> start<00:01:47.880> forming

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
over to the instrument and start forming

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.630 
over to the instrument and start forming
the<00:01:48.420> chord<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> bass<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.920> even<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> simpler

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the chord and the bass or even a simpler

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.220 
the chord and the bass or even a simpler
one<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.300> take<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.660> finger<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
one it's just to take a finger and a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.230 
one it's just to take a finger and a
finger<00:01:52.260> like<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:55.670> that's<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.760> really<00:01:57.030> nice

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
finger like that that's a really nice

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
finger like that that's a really nice
beginning<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.230> get<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> rhythm<00:01:58.830> started<00:01:59.370> if

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
beginning way to get a rhythm started if

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.180 
beginning way to get a rhythm started if
you're<00:01:59.550> having<00:01:59.820> any<00:01:59.910> trouble<00:02:00.120> getting<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
you're having any trouble getting the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.050 
you're having any trouble getting the
fingers<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.640> want<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.910> learn<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
fingers in there and you want to learn a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
fingers in there and you want to learn a
rhythm<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.720> like<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.410> sound<00:02:04.560> like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
rhythm so like that it would sound like

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.300 
rhythm so like that it would sound like
this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.490 

and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.480> course<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:13.990> build<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.470> that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and then of course you can build on that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.650 
and then of course you can build on that
by<00:02:14.770> moving<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> bass<00:02:15.850> back<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.450> forth

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
by moving the the bass back and forth

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.600 
by moving the the bass back and forth
between<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.110> root<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> fifth<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.520> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
between the root and the fifth so you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:30.949 
between the root and the fifth so you
play<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.140> would<00:02:23.319> sound<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.620> this

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.630 

okay<00:02:31.959> we're<00:02:32.530> gonna<00:02:32.620> learn<00:02:32.800> another<00:02:33.250> rhythm

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
okay we're gonna learn another rhythm

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.120 
okay we're gonna learn another rhythm
pattern<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.810> rhythm<00:02:35.290> pattern<00:02:35.680> basically

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
pattern this rhythm pattern basically

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.229 
pattern this rhythm pattern basically
involves<00:02:37.120> playing<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:38.020> 6/8<00:02:38.650> I'm<00:02:39.430> gonna<00:02:39.730> take<00:02:40.030> a

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
involves playing in 6/8 I'm gonna take a

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.949 
involves playing in 6/8 I'm gonna take a
D<00:02:40.510> minor<00:02:40.840> chord<00:02:41.700> that's<00:02:42.700> really<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.540> drum

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
D minor chord that's really just a drum

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.350 
D minor chord that's really just a drum
meaning<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.620> root<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.489> fifth<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.090> third

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
meaning the root the fifth and the third

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.190 
meaning the root the fifth and the third
and<00:02:46.720> then<00:02:46.810> play<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.020> D<00:02:47.290> minor<00:02:47.530> here

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
and then play a D minor here

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.160 
and then play a D minor here
kind<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.890> an<00:02:50.010> easy<00:02:50.190> shape<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.870> rhythm

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
kind of an easy shape and the rhythm

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.200 
kind of an easy shape and the rhythm
pattern<00:02:52.500> will<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:52.770> something<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.190> this

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.390 

all<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.840> well<00:02:57.990> what's<00:02:58.230> happening<00:02:58.770> is<00:02:58.950> again

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
all right well what's happening is again

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.920 
all right well what's happening is again
the<00:02:59.550> hands<00:02:59.760> aren't<00:03:00.000> playing<00:03:00.270> together<00:03:00.510> on

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the hands aren't playing together on

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.460 
the hands aren't playing together on
that<00:03:01.110> middle<00:03:01.440> part<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:02.310> goes<00:03:02.550> bass<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.150> court

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
that middle part it goes bass in court

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.130 
that middle part it goes bass in court
then<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.500> finish<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.100> these<00:03:05.280> two<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:07.020> then

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
then I finish with these two and then

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.950 
then I finish with these two and then
the<00:03:07.260> chord<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:08.850> finish<00:03:09.240> off<00:03:09.420> when<00:03:09.750> those

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
the chord and then finish off when those

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.440 
the chord and then finish off when those
two<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.710> makes<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.070> nice<00:03:11.280> rhythmic<00:03:11.670> 6/8

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
two that makes a nice rhythmic 6/8

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.320 
two that makes a nice rhythmic 6/8
pattern

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.690 

sounds<00:03:19.170> pretty<00:03:19.320> full<00:03:19.680> even<00:03:20.100> though<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> hands

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
sounds pretty full even though the hands

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.330 
sounds pretty full even though the hands
are<00:03:20.850> playing<00:03:21.150> at<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.330> same<00:03:21.630> time<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.950> court

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
are playing at the same time this court

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.320 
are playing at the same time this court
for<00:03:23.580> fun<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:24.060> move<00:03:24.380> decd<00:03:25.380> flats<00:03:26.160> eg<00:03:26.910> which<00:03:27.210> is

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
for fun can move decd flats eg which is

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.780 
for fun can move decd flats eg which is
a<00:03:27.360> popular<00:03:28.020> chord<00:03:28.290> progression<00:03:28.830> would<00:03:29.490> sound

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
a popular chord progression would sound

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:39.910 
a popular chord progression would sound
like<00:03:29.940> this

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920 

notice<00:03:40.730> that<00:03:40.850> I'm<00:03:41.000> holding<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.450> note<00:03:41.720> down

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
notice that I'm holding that note down

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.010 
notice that I'm holding that note down
too<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.230> don't<00:03:42.500> lift<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.830> off<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.970> hold<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.870> down

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
too I don't lift it off I hold it down

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.680 
too I don't lift it off I hold it down
and<00:03:45.320> let<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.530> ring<00:03:45.950> by<00:03:46.820> letting<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.360> note

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
and let it ring by letting this note

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.170 
and let it ring by letting this note
ring<00:03:48.020> out<00:03:48.230> longer<00:03:48.560> he<00:03:48.800> gives<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.310> fullness<00:03:49.970> a

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
ring out longer he gives it a fullness a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.699 
ring out longer he gives it a fullness a
really<00:03:50.510> nice<00:03:50.690> sound<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.920> fill<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.310> out

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.410 

okay<00:03:58.709> another<00:03:59.129> pattern<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.760> do<00:03:59.909> is<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.360> do

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
okay another pattern that I do is I do

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.050 
okay another pattern that I do is I do
with<00:04:00.780> eighth<00:04:01.500> notes<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.310> more<00:04:02.849> of<00:04:02.969> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
with eighth notes and more of the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.759 
with eighth notes and more of the
standard<00:04:03.299> rhythm<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.170> play<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.560> same

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
standard rhythm and I play the same

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.130 
standard rhythm and I play the same
shape<00:04:05.189> here<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.909> go<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.599> D<00:04:06.870> major<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.530> time

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
shape here I go to a D major this time

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.740 
shape here I go to a D major this time
now<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.590> somewhat<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.579> an<00:04:11.700> arpeggio<00:04:12.120> as

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
now this is somewhat of an arpeggio as

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.490 
now this is somewhat of an arpeggio as
well<00:04:13.260> as<00:04:13.409> it<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.950> rhythm<00:04:14.340> pattern<00:04:15.229> I'm<00:04:16.229> gonna

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
well as it is a rhythm pattern I'm gonna

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.890 
well as it is a rhythm pattern I'm gonna
play<00:04:16.829> these<00:04:17.250> two<00:04:17.609> notes<00:04:17.639> with<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.329> left<00:04:18.449> hand

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
play these two notes with the left hand

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.980 
play these two notes with the left hand
and<00:04:19.410> then<00:04:20.340> these<00:04:20.549> two<00:04:20.880> notes

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and then these two notes

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.890 
and then these two notes
what<00:04:23.620> happens<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.610> basic<00:04:25.150> pattern<00:04:25.389> I'm

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
what happens is the basic pattern I'm

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.210 
what happens is the basic pattern I'm
going<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.139> take<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.349> bass<00:04:26.560> away<00:04:26.889> for<00:04:27.069> a<00:04:27.130> minute

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
going to take the bass away for a minute

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.420 
going to take the bass away for a minute
is<00:04:27.750> nothing<00:04:28.750> more<00:04:28.960> than<00:04:29.199> this

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.850 

with<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.180> baseplate<00:04:35.630> on<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.020> first<00:04:36.290> note<00:04:36.620> at

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
with the baseplate on the first note at

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.480 
with the baseplate on the first note at
the<00:04:37.100> same<00:04:37.310> time<00:04:37.610> as<00:04:37.759> this

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.450 

and<00:04:43.970> then<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.960> can<00:04:45.169> first<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:46.009> all<00:04:46.130> before<00:04:46.310> I

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
and then I can first of all before I

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.860 
and then I can first of all before I
actually<00:04:46.729> move<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.210> court<00:04:47.449> I'm<00:04:47.660> going<00:04:47.810> to

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
actually move the court I'm going to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.930 
actually move the court I'm going to
just<00:04:48.020> play<00:04:48.169> that<00:04:48.440> rhythmically<00:04:49.039> that<00:04:49.280> part

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.760 

now<00:04:53.480> I<00:04:53.510> can<00:04:53.810> move<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.140> cord

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.409 

so<00:04:58.310> there's<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.580> nice<00:04:58.729> pattern<00:04:59.090> where<00:04:59.330> I'm

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
so there's a nice pattern where I'm

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:11.330 
so there's a nice pattern where I'm
droning<00:04:59.930> this<00:05:00.199> off<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.490> major<00:05:01.669> chord

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:21.390 

or<00:05:11.640> play<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.880> continuous

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.010 

I'm<00:05:21.639> adding<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.030> base<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.479> every<00:05:22.630> once<00:05:22.840> in<00:05:22.960> a

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
I'm adding the base and every once in a

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.629 
I'm adding the base and every once in a
while<00:05:23.169> that<00:05:23.410> actually<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.220> can<00:05:24.340> build<00:05:24.520> your

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
while that actually you can build your

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.550 
while that actually you can build your
speed<00:05:24.970> up<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.240> sounds<00:05:25.389> like<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.660> guitar<00:05:25.870> sort<00:05:26.500> of

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
speed up it sounds like a guitar sort of

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:34.469 
speed up it sounds like a guitar sort of
like<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.710> finger<00:05:27.040> picking<00:05:27.250> style

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.809 

okay<00:05:35.479> so<00:05:35.539> that's<00:05:35.870> basically<00:05:36.590> an<00:05:36.830> eight<00:05:37.129> no

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
okay so that's basically an eight no

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.200 
okay so that's basically an eight no
pattern<00:05:38.719> per<00:05:39.020> measure<00:05:39.639> more<00:05:40.639> like<00:05:40.819> a<00:05:40.849> guitar

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
pattern per measure more like a guitar

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.689 
pattern per measure more like a guitar
finger-picking<00:05:42.009> another<00:05:43.009> one<00:05:43.249> is<00:05:43.430> a<00:05:43.460> little

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
finger-picking another one is a little

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.330 
finger-picking another one is a little
bit<00:05:43.939> of<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.150> funkier<00:05:44.629> one<00:05:44.840> where<00:05:45.469> say<00:05:45.889> I<00:05:46.129> want<00:05:46.310> to

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
bit of a funkier one where say I want to

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.249 
bit of a funkier one where say I want to
play<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.490> bass<00:05:46.759> line<00:05:46.939> I<00:05:47.360> like<00:05:47.629> this<00:05:47.840> one<00:05:48.050> where<00:05:48.229> I

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
play a bass line I like this one where I

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.399 
play a bass line I like this one where I
play<00:05:48.439> room<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:50.240> then<00:05:50.389> the<00:05:50.509> ninth<00:05:50.779> kind<00:05:51.349> of

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
play room and then the ninth kind of

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.929 
play room and then the ninth kind of
makes<00:05:51.560> it<00:05:51.680> nice<00:05:53.860> that<00:05:54.860> kind<00:05:55.099> of<00:05:55.189> a<00:05:55.249> sound<00:05:55.639> and

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
makes it nice that kind of a sound and

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.719 
makes it nice that kind of a sound and
then<00:05:56.360> I'll<00:05:56.479> play<00:05:56.659> our<00:05:56.810> same<00:05:57.460> chord<00:05:58.460> that<00:05:58.639> we

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
then I'll play our same chord that we

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.119 
then I'll play our same chord that we
did<00:05:58.909> over<00:05:59.120> here<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.419> E<00:05:59.449> flat<00:05:59.569> major<00:05:59.990> triad

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
did over here the E flat major triad

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.709 
did over here the E flat major triad
that<00:06:01.129> forms<00:06:01.520> a<00:06:01.610> C<00:06:01.789> minor<00:06:02.029> 7th

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
that forms a C minor 7th

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.969 
that forms a C minor 7th
now<00:06:03.499> here<00:06:05.110> I'm<00:06:06.110> playing<00:06:06.349> the<00:06:06.560> chord<00:06:06.830> in

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
now here I'm playing the chord in

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.800 
now here I'm playing the chord in
between<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.610> first<00:06:07.969> bass<00:06:08.330> note<00:06:08.569> in<00:06:08.719> the

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
between the first bass note in the

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.429 
between the first bass note in the
second<00:06:09.199> one<00:06:12.310> then<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:13.400> play<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.669> chord<00:06:13.909> again

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 
second one then I play the chord again

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:21.879 
second one then I play the chord again
so<00:06:15.439> I<00:06:15.469> put<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.860> rhythm<00:06:16.159> pattern<00:06:16.490> together<00:06:20.889> and

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
so I put the rhythm pattern together and

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.830 
so I put the rhythm pattern together and
I<00:06:22.009> can<00:06:22.159> even<00:06:22.370> add<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.490> chord<00:06:22.789> it<00:06:22.909> but<00:06:23.029> right

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
I can even add a chord it but right

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.540 
I can even add a chord it but right
before<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.409> last<00:06:24.560> note<00:06:24.889> make<00:06:25.219> it<00:06:25.310> little<00:06:25.460> more

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
before the last note make it little more

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:33.360 
before the last note make it little more
funky

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.490 

slower<00:06:36.449> and<00:06:37.449> use<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:37.780> sort<00:06:38.050> of<00:06:38.110> a<00:06:38.169> double

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
slower and use that sort of a double

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.040 
slower and use that sort of a double
like<00:06:39.130> that<00:06:39.340> which<00:06:39.550> is<00:06:39.699> nice<00:06:42.720> if<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:43.840> really

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
like that which is nice if you really

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.390 
like that which is nice if you really
want<00:06:44.229> to<00:06:44.290> play<00:06:44.410> fast<00:06:44.680> you<00:06:44.860> can<00:06:45.010> leave<00:06:45.190> out<00:06:45.340> the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
want to play fast you can leave out the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:53.280 
want to play fast you can leave out the
first<00:06:45.760> mic<00:06:51.419> that<00:06:52.419> makes<00:06:52.630> it<00:06:52.750> sounds<00:06:53.020> kind<00:06:53.260> of

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
first mic that makes it sounds kind of

00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:06.600 
first mic that makes it sounds kind of
syncopated<00:07:04.710> with<00:07:05.710> all<00:07:06.010> of<00:07:06.160> these<00:07:06.310> patterns

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
syncopated with all of these patterns

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.879 
syncopated with all of these patterns
you<00:07:07.120> can<00:07:07.300> make<00:07:07.630> them<00:07:07.810> more<00:07:07.990> complex<00:07:08.560> and<00:07:08.830> more

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
you can make them more complex and more

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.620 
you can make them more complex and more
interesting<00:07:09.490> by<00:07:09.669> moving<00:07:09.940> the<00:07:10.180> bass<00:07:10.330> line

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
interesting by moving the bass line

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:22.890 
interesting by moving the bass line
around<00:07:10.840> so<00:07:11.020> I<00:07:11.050> play<00:07:11.320> in<00:07:11.470> the<00:07:11.560> same<00:07:11.800> feel

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.900 

like<00:07:23.900> that<00:07:24.110> same<00:07:24.890> thing<00:07:25.100> with<00:07:25.130> the<00:07:25.370> original

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
like that same thing with the original

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.610 
like that same thing with the original
pattern<00:07:26.150> which<00:07:26.450> blends<00:07:26.810> in<00:07:27.050> well<00:07:27.230> with<00:07:27.290> that

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
pattern which blends in well with that

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.690 
pattern which blends in well with that
one<00:07:27.830> right<00:07:28.730> left<00:07:29.060> right<00:07:29.240> left

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700 
one right left right left

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:37.830 
one right left right left
I<00:07:30.760> start<00:07:31.600> moving<00:07:31.690> the<00:07:31.900> face<00:07:32.050> there<00:07:32.410> as<00:07:32.560> well

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.870 

so<00:07:38.840> I<00:07:38.870> do<00:07:39.020> a<00:07:39.200> lot<00:07:39.680> of<00:07:39.710> plane<00:07:40.370> where<00:07:40.670> I<00:07:40.730> have

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 
so I do a lot of plane where I have

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.300 
so I do a lot of plane where I have
these<00:07:41.260> combinations<00:07:42.260> of<00:07:42.380> rhythmic<00:07:42.860> patterns

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.310 
these combinations of rhythmic patterns

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.210 
these combinations of rhythmic patterns
once<00:07:44.210> I<00:07:44.420> learn<00:07:44.630> the<00:07:44.810> rhythmic<00:07:45.170> pattern<00:07:45.200> then<00:07:46.190> I

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.220 
once I learn the rhythmic pattern then I

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.400 
once I learn the rhythmic pattern then I
just<00:07:46.550> start<00:07:46.790> to<00:07:46.910> move<00:07:47.060> either<00:07:47.240> the<00:07:47.510> cord<00:07:48.020> or

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.410 
just start to move either the cord or

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.250 
just start to move either the cord or
the<00:07:48.470> bass<00:07:48.970> around<00:07:49.970> the<00:07:50.300> rhythmic<00:07:50.660> pattern<00:07:50.690> and

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.260 
the bass around the rhythmic pattern and

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.370 
the bass around the rhythmic pattern and
then<00:07:51.800> that<00:07:51.980> gives<00:07:52.160> me<00:07:52.370> my<00:07:52.490> rhythm<00:07:52.790> that<00:07:53.150> way<00:07:53.380> so

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.380 
then that gives me my rhythm that way so

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.020 
then that gives me my rhythm that way so
again<00:07:54.530> you<00:07:54.800> just<00:07:54.950> basically<00:07:55.370> start<00:07:55.730> out<00:07:55.850> with

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.030 
again you just basically start out with

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.350 
again you just basically start out with
one<00:07:56.390> horn<00:07:56.810> one<00:07:57.260> bass<00:07:57.550> work<00:07:58.550> out<00:07:58.760> the<00:07:58.940> pattern

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 
one horn one bass work out the pattern

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.820 
one horn one bass work out the pattern
and<00:07:59.570> then<00:07:59.660> start<00:08:00.020> to<00:08:00.140> move<00:08:00.170> the<00:08:00.320> bass<00:08:00.620> around

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:00.830 
and then start to move the bass around
