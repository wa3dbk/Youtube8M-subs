00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.300
 hello with you your throat has not gone mad 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.670
 samsung advertising is just the thing 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.830
 I really have quite often 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.080
 there are discussions that go 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.880
 disputes with android users 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.550
 relative advantage of 100 or other about 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.710
 the cheese of this or that device and in 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.330
 I just brought the last of them to me 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.880
 to handle the main type argument 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.800
 iPhone tachaydi samsung has already broken and you 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 right now see on the screen how much 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.030
 is strong and now iphone only remains 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.250
 catch up with competitors but practically 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.619
 Immediately my moment so to speak decided that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.240
 the pen is not here yet and paul much further and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.369
 in all seriousness took in as 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.390
 argument not even clever slavka my God 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.760
 samsung watch 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.280
 a heart rate monitor built into the flash 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.619
 fashioned galaxy s5 demo 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.720
 which you saw at the beginning of this video 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.910
 I decided to close the discussion 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 Finally, if this video is just 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.420
 convey to your viewers the thought of 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.650
 what a huge amount of functionality 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 which is built out of the box in 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.640
 flagship devices for android and 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.619
 which she is trying to show as something 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.720
 incredible really already long 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.970
 has long existed on ios as those or 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.100
 other applications from the appstore and the same 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.140
 heart rate monitor phpstorm dime a dozen like 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.940
 paid and not very like too 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.970
 runtastic solution is available from 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.769
 January 13 and I'm sure if I rummage 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.860
 you can find much more ancient 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.150
 the application works all this business 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.790
 Naturally on the same principle as 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.489
 galaxy s5 just run the app 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.890
 hold your finger to the flash quite a bit 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.660
 waiting and getting results and what 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.820
 cool ege not fully understood 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.040
 how it all works but indicators 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.050
 heart rate as far as I understood in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.420
 reality is very, very close to the truth 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.190
 I don't want to do it again 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.320

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.390
