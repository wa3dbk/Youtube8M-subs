00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.190
 Continuing the theme of the oval ball 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.299
 Russian type of airball in the capital final 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.810
 championship russia american 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.800
 football turned out to be the most 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.159
 tense over all russian history 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.329
 defeat Moscow under his talents 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.279
 championship russia dream of many teams 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.089
 if more unexpected got 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.169
 first jubilee final 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.919
 twentieth season 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.969
 who came to the capital of Chelyabinsk scouts 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:24.559
 match against the permanent leader 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.699
 last years confidently led to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.619
 account 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 I think football is like out of 10 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.729
 permissible brought in there 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.309
 20 kopecks why is it so different on the ground 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:34.710
 same points 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.950
 known to them 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.830
 I will 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.100
 Muscovites have a lot of time 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.020
 it took everything to fall into their 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.000
 places 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 against the background of patriots Chelyabinsk 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.180
 the team looked badly played in 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.100
 first of all because of the final in fact 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.920
 a brand new team has gathered 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.090
 Ural clubs 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.660
 we put a lot of dilemma 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.830
 Estonia all the same as the failure that 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.510
 n this championship and the participation of players 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.670
 young from all cities of which 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.740
 allow us to develop this sport 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.170
 much faster throughout 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.910
 because the players got invaluable 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.900
 experience 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.920
 if only one team would play 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.990
 harder to develop this one 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.300
 american football in recent years 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.530
 american football made serious 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 a leap in development in our country 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.370
 for example 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.170
 Russian Championship for the first time took 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.410
 participating in 17 13 teams along with the number 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.650
 growing quality 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.440
 the advantage of her spectator interest 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.000
 the organizers already dream that when 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.220
 someday in the Russian superbowl will gather 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.340
 full puddles i think that when people 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 understand that american football 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 you can play but I will ask obama equal 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.570
 Europe with Americans 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.230
 then a working bank will appear when 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.990
 there will be a desire to win the strongest 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.100
 shower when support appears i think everything 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.670
 will it be ok will it be 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.420
 deserve grounded 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 everything is good 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.690
 for now in our american football 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.480
 still remains valid and marched 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.770
 irritants moscow patriots 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.370
 beat again no one could and they in 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.570
 the tenth time is champions of the country 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.869
 novel novels they wrote 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.610
 generally 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.040
 in the Omsk region faced November
