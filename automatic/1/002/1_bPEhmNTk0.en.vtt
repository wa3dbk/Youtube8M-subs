00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello videos ca today I want you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 Just show what I like fruit and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.480
 vegetables just at my house have something 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 So I currently as raw food and so on 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.200
 I suppose the food will be in yes 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 categorized 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 there are the fruits so there are those 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.900
 category fruits then produce fruit then 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.020
 there is the category fruit vegetables 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 Vegetable products and legumes 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 In addition, there are cereal products 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 milk dairy meat and so on 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.000
 I am always farther than the orchestra 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 become aware again how diverse 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.790
 actually the fruits and vegetables 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 categories are 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.020
 if I go to the others now 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.210
 Food categories such as 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.219
 for cereals and cereal products 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 straight at bread these are the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.910
 output products actually only 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.090
 wheat and rye spelled too 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.550
 share or meat 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.940
 yes, meat consumed by beef 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 pig and chicken and so I am 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.129
 Rarely in the supermarket but there 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 it's always full of those huge shelves 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.100
 dairy products that seems for the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 most probably incredible 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
 to be diverse the choice but one 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.330
 Do not forget the output product 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.040
 is only cow milk so we talk yes 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 also not from schaaf goat milk or 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 Study would like that is irrelevant 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.240
 The size of the dairy will be real 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 only made from cow's milk 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 just as the food industry has 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 a few starting materials are practical 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 picked and then in the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.090
 mass produced and with diversity is there 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.590
 not missing 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 I show you now I actually know 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.210
 Now there are fruit vegetables there too 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.900
 another choice that is still long 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.670
 not everything 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.659
 I'll take now time the camera 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.270
 and I'll just start with it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.060
 Things are happening in Germany right now 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 Most things are there too 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.229
 regional and you can really 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.579
 all eat unprocessed with it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.430
 so let me here so little woman apple 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:05.750
 savoy pumpkin two different 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:09.239
 cauliflower varieties then mushrooms 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.160
 Onions also have two varieties of big tomatoes 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:18.060
 then here so different little ones 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:21.060
 have wait then have different 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.300
 here we are still the parsnip then 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.400
 we have stalk celery carrots here 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 that parsley root here 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.490
 a little bit like that happens even a lot 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.300
 So it's smaller for me, white cabbage 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:44.550
 Chinese cabbage to talk 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:47.670
 radishes broccoli kohlrabi knows and 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.680
 pray here what is very important to me 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.590
 So a very important one completely 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.820
 important building block in the raw food 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.130
 bild you can now green around the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.530
 Jahr still hears very well 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.460
 I also collected this very fresh today 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.250
 are first of all, especially large quantities 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:12.720
 nettle then we have here 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:16.320
 dandelion yarrow still said 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.950
 guntermann that is guntermann whole 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.290
 important for me too this this 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.600
 wild green this is the bird of prey 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.360
 unbelievable minerals and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.380
 so rich in vitamins and lots of iron 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.380
 and calcium 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.800
 Now let's go over to the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.420
 southern fruits and we would have here 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.100
 oranges two different varieties 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.870
 million a coconut then one here 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.630
 I drink and I really appreciate that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.640
 This summer it's just going to be here 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.350
 a hole drilled there will come 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.440
 this nutritious liquid tuned that way 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.790
 delicious then you write it here on the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.860
 and then you get to that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.080
 delicious pulp 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.940
 then we have banana mango I have 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.989
 I think so 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.989
 lemons Ocado we have here 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:14.600
 prickly pears then my mango then 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:19.170

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:24.300
 orleans kiwi chilies 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.950
 ginger garlic and nutmeg open so 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.600
 you are right potatoes, they are stronger 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.030
 I think there is a cost per food 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 in his tight but I prefer or 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.180
 Long live the sweet potato and the circuit 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.580
 Bananas so have to be really dark 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.020
 its really black 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.790
 most people do not think so anymore 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.550
 appetizing but then you can 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.260
 plantains also eat raw and then 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.590
 unfolds it so a fine apricot 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.590
 Aroma 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.430
 Now I just showed you 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.010
 what is then if it must have with me 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.690
 that's just a facet of raw food in 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.980
 I'll show you one of the next videos 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.980
 which focus can still be
