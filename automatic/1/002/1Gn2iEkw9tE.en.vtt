that it looks like the NYC is calling
out<00:02:09.459> into<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.819> fine<00:02:10.030> lines<00:02:10.299> of<00:02:10.479> my<00:02:10.600> hand<00:02:10.989> so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
not very good signs so far so I'm going

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.890 
not very good signs so far so I'm going
to<00:02:18.310> go<00:02:18.430> ahead<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.670> take<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.330> watches<00:02:19.750> off

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
to go ahead and take this watches off

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.110 
to go ahead and take this watches off
and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.319> I'll<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:20.830> right<00:02:20.980> into<00:02:21.190> applying

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
and then I'll get right into applying

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.589 
and then I'll get right into applying
this<00:02:22.420> liner<00:02:22.660> ok<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.380> let's<00:02:23.709> hope<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.819> NYC

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
this liner ok so let's hope that the NYC

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.180 
this liner ok so let's hope that the NYC
liner<00:02:25.840> does<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.349> little<00:02:26.590> bit<00:02:26.709> better<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:26.980> my

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190

some felt tip liners they can kind of
bend<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.709> tip<00:02:41.890> can<00:02:42.070> bend<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.790> allow<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.120> a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
little bit more wiggle room this isn't

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 
little bit more wiggle room this isn't
like<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.060> extremely

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680

on it there is no get here some of you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.160 
on it there is no get here some of you
might<00:02:55.629> consider<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.379> negative<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:59.079> I'm

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
might consider that a negative so I'm

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.449 
might consider that a negative so I'm
just<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.439> go<00:02:59.530> ahead<00:02:59.739> and<00:02:59.920> apply<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.189> to

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
just going to go ahead and apply this to

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.860 
just going to go ahead and apply this to
my<00:03:00.579> eye

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.970 

you

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.140 

so<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.070> pen<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.430> really<00:03:12.700> easy<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.970> work<00:03:13.090> with

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
so the pen is really easy to work with

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.090 
so the pen is really easy to work with
but<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.780> fact<00:03:13.990> that<00:03:14.050> it's<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.410> little<00:03:14.440> bit<00:03:14.650> firm

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
but the fact that it's a little bit firm

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.550 
but the fact that it's a little bit firm
is<00:03:15.630> especially<00:03:16.630> difficult<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.260> come<00:03:17.440> to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
is especially difficult when you come to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.930 
is especially difficult when you come to
the<00:03:17.620> outside<00:03:17.950> corner<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.310> your<00:03:18.460> eye<00:03:18.490> because

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
the outside corner of your eye because

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.670 
the outside corner of your eye because
you<00:03:19.060> kind<00:03:19.240> of<00:03:19.270> need<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.690> give<00:03:20.050> if<00:03:20.500> you're

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
you kind of need that give if you're

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.800 
you kind of need that give if you're
trying<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:21.040> do<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> wing<00:03:21.580> because<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.570> want<00:03:22.720> to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
trying to do a wing because you want to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.500 
trying to do a wing because you want to
drag<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.500> along<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.100> texture<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.180> outside

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
drag it along the texture of the outside

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.330 
drag it along the texture of the outside
corner<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:25.960> your<00:03:26.110> eye<00:03:26.140> have<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.950> little<00:03:27.160> bit<00:03:27.310> of

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
corner of your eye have a little bit of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.740 
corner of your eye have a little bit of
movement<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.970> there<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> little<00:03:28.540> bit<00:03:28.720> of

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
movement in there and a little bit of

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.830 
movement in there and a little bit of
give<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.700> because<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:31.030> doesn't<00:03:31.330> have<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.480> it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
give and because it doesn't have that it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.390 
give and because it doesn't have that it
ends<00:03:32.050> up<00:03:32.110> being<00:03:32.140> kind<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.530> scratchy<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.280> like

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
ends up being kind of scratchy and like

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.250 
ends up being kind of scratchy and like

the first impression alright guys i'm
back<00:03:45.040> from<00:03:45.790> doing<00:03:46.090> both<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.390> my<00:03:46.630> eyes<00:03:46.660> with

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
back from doing both of my eyes with

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.130 
back from doing both of my eyes with
this<00:03:47.350> liner<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.920> as<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.910> can<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.570> dries

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
this liner and as you can see it dries

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.940 
this liner and as you can see it dries
to<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> matte<00:03:51.130> finish<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.480> opacity<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.590> of

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
to a matte finish the opacity is of

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.520 
to a matte finish the opacity is of
course<00:03:54.160> not<00:03:54.550> perfect<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:55.510> i<00:03:55.900> think<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.320> does

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
course not perfect but i think it does

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.250 
course not perfect but i think it does
look<00:03:56.739> better<00:03:56.920> once<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.670> liner<00:03:57.880> has<00:03:58.120> dried<00:03:58.510> but

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
look better once the liner has dried but

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.520 
look better once the liner has dried but

this<00:05:10.870> week<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.979> say<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.460> performed

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
this week and I have to say it performed

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.020 
this week and I have to say it performed
extremely<00:05:13.570> well<00:05:13.840> better<00:05:14.530> than<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.830> expected

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
extremely well better than I expected

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.210 
extremely well better than I expected
definitely<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.180> was<00:05:16.630> very<00:05:17.080> worried<00:05:17.650> wearing

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
definitely I was very worried wearing

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.360 
definitely I was very worried wearing
this<00:05:18.310> liner<00:05:18.610> out<00:05:18.729> in<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.570> ring

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
this liner out in the ring

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.040 
this liner out in the ring
and<00:05:20.460> thinking<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:21.540> was<00:05:21.600> probably<00:05:21.930> going

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
and thinking that it was probably going

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.260 
and thinking that it was probably going
to<00:05:22.229> be<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.380> hot<00:05:22.770> mess<00:05:22.800> by<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.370> end<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.639> my<00:05:23.790> class

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
to be a hot mess by the end of my class

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.129 
to be a hot mess by the end of my class
days<00:05:24.630> but<00:05:25.580> as<00:05:26.580> far<00:05:26.820> as<00:05:26.880> where<00:05:27.090> time<00:05:27.330> goes<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.840> was

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
days but as far as where time goes I was

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.770 
days but as far as where time goes I was
very<00:05:28.590> impressed<00:05:28.889> it<00:05:29.699> is<00:05:30.090> not<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.300> waterproof

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
very impressed it is not a waterproof

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.980 
very impressed it is not a waterproof
liner<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.979> did<00:05:32.490> run<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.790> little<00:05:33.210> bit<00:05:33.540> a

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
liner and it did run a little bit a

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.490 
liner and it did run a little bit a
couple<00:05:34.380> hours<00:05:34.650> into<00:05:35.400> my<00:05:35.850> day<00:05:35.910> especially

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
couple hours into my day especially

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.590 
couple hours into my day especially
walking<00:05:37.500> outside<00:05:37.650> between<00:05:38.340> classes<00:05:38.880> but<00:05:39.270> I

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
walking outside between classes but I

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.180 
walking outside between classes but I
was<00:05:39.840> very<00:05:39.870> impressed<00:05:40.229> at<00:05:40.620> how<00:05:40.650> this<00:05:40.949> liner

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
was very impressed at how this liner

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.180 
was very impressed at how this liner
held<00:05:41.580> its<00:05:41.790> original<00:05:42.210> shape<00:05:42.510> even<00:05:42.840> in<00:05:43.199> this<00:05:43.500> wet

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
held its original shape even in this wet

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.570 
held its original shape even in this wet
gross<00:05:44.790> weather<00:05:45.750> because<00:05:46.500> it<00:05:46.949> did<00:05:47.190> run<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.400> bit

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
gross weather because it did run a bit

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.700 
gross weather because it did run a bit
but<00:05:47.699> I<00:05:47.760> could<00:05:47.940> just<00:05:48.060> wipe<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.600> excess<00:05:48.720> off<00:05:49.199> and

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
but I could just wipe the excess off and

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.100 
but I could just wipe the excess off and
then<00:05:49.949> there<00:05:50.639> was<00:05:50.790> still<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:52.020> original

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
then there was still the the original

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.779 
then there was still the the original
shape<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:52.830> place<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.250> liner<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.520> it

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
shape that I place the liner and it

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.840 
shape that I place the liner and it
wasn't<00:05:54.180> totally<00:05:54.900> crumbling<00:05:55.889> everything<00:05:56.699> that

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
wasn't totally crumbling everything that

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.820 
wasn't totally crumbling everything that
I<00:05:56.880> put<00:05:57.120> down<00:05:57.150> was<00:05:57.539> not<00:05:57.780> destroyed<00:05:58.350> in<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.650> rain

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
I put down was not destroyed in the rain

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.129 
I put down was not destroyed in the rain
which<00:05:59.039> I<00:05:59.280> was<00:05:59.729> happy<00:06:00.030> with<00:06:00.389> maybe<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.840> had

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
which I was happy with maybe I had

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.500 
which I was happy with maybe I had
lowered<00:06:01.590> standards<00:06:01.860> because<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.430> last<00:06:03.210> line

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
lowered standards because the last line

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.930 
lowered standards because the last line
are<00:06:03.690> viewed<00:06:04.050> was<00:06:04.350> pretty<00:06:05.250> awful<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.820> that

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
are viewed was pretty awful in that

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.180 
are viewed was pretty awful in that
respect<00:06:06.449> but<00:06:06.900> yes<00:06:07.410> I<00:06:07.590> was<00:06:07.740> strangely

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
respect but yes I was strangely

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.060 
respect but yes I was strangely
impressed<00:06:08.699> so<00:06:09.289> awesome<00:06:10.289> with<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.530> where<00:06:10.770> time

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
impressed so awesome with the where time

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.129 
impressed so awesome with the where time
the<00:06:11.490> only<00:06:11.760> downside<00:06:12.030> with<00:06:12.630> this<00:06:12.750> liner<00:06:12.960> is

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
the only downside with this liner is

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.890 
the only downside with this liner is
application<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:14.910> I<00:06:15.150> think<00:06:15.419> it's<00:06:15.570> partially

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
application it I think it's partially

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.080 
application it I think it's partially
because<00:06:16.199> of<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.500> formula<00:06:16.889> like<00:06:17.370> I<00:06:17.490> said<00:06:17.820> in<00:06:18.060> my

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
because of the formula like I said in my

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.810 
because of the formula like I said in my
first<00:06:18.270> impression<00:06:19.169> it<00:06:19.410> was<00:06:19.500> watery<00:06:19.949> it<00:06:20.310> was

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
first impression it was watery it was

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.469 
first impression it was watery it was
transparent<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.810> for<00:06:22.139> that<00:06:22.260> reason<00:06:22.320> it<00:06:23.070> just

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
transparent and for that reason it just

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.879 
transparent and for that reason it just
it<00:06:24.479> just<00:06:24.539> didn't<00:06:24.990> stay<00:06:25.260> it's<00:06:25.560> not<00:06:25.710> you're<00:06:25.860> not

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
it just didn't stay it's not you're not

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.529 
it just didn't stay it's not you're not
going<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:26.130> get<00:06:26.220> a<00:06:26.250> precise<00:06:26.669> line<00:06:27.210> with<00:06:27.419> this

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
going to get a precise line with this

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.640 
going to get a precise line with this
liner<00:06:27.780> so<00:06:28.169> if<00:06:28.410> you're<00:06:28.620> very<00:06:29.430> into<00:06:30.000> a<00:06:30.650> sharp

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
liner so if you're very into a sharp

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.920 
liner so if you're very into a sharp
defined<00:06:32.400> precise<00:06:32.970> line<00:06:33.300> then<00:06:33.570> I<00:06:33.599> just

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
defined precise line then I just

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.270 
defined precise line then I just
wouldn't<00:06:34.169> get<00:06:34.320> this<00:06:34.470> liner<00:06:34.650> if<00:06:34.860> I<00:06:34.950> was<00:06:35.099> you

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
wouldn't get this liner if I was you

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.219 
wouldn't get this liner if I was you
also<00:06:35.729> the<00:06:35.940> other<00:06:36.060> issue<00:06:36.419> that<00:06:36.570> I<00:06:36.690> had<00:06:36.900> with<00:06:37.110> the

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
also the other issue that I had with the

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.210 
also the other issue that I had with the
application<00:06:37.830> was<00:06:37.979> that<00:06:38.250> the<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.990> tip<00:06:40.440> of<00:06:40.620> the

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
application was that the the tip of the

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.360 
application was that the the tip of the
liner<00:06:41.700> is<00:06:41.940> so<00:06:42.180> unwieldy<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:42.900> bulky<00:06:43.650> that<00:06:44.010> you

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
liner is so unwieldy and bulky that you

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.570 
liner is so unwieldy and bulky that you
could<00:06:44.550> not<00:06:44.669> really<00:06:45.210> get<00:06:45.479> an<00:06:45.690> awesome<00:06:46.580> sharp

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
could not really get an awesome sharp

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.850 
could not really get an awesome sharp
shape<00:06:47.910> with<00:06:48.120> it<00:06:48.270> so<00:06:48.599> if<00:06:49.020> you're<00:06:49.500> that<00:06:49.620> kind<00:06:49.770> of

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
shape with it so if you're that kind of

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.939 
shape with it so if you're that kind of
person<00:06:49.919> that<00:06:50.750> isn't<00:06:51.750> that<00:06:52.020> precise<00:06:52.500> with

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
person that isn't that precise with

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.469 
person that isn't that precise with
airliners<00:06:53.490> you<00:06:53.610> just<00:06:53.789> want<00:06:53.940> a<00:06:54.000> line<00:06:54.210> and

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
airliners you just want a line and

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:55.850 
airliners you just want a line and
that's<00:06:54.660> all<00:06:54.810> you<00:06:54.960> want<00:06:55.169> then<00:06:55.380> this<00:06:55.740> would

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
that's all you want then this would

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.860 
that's all you want then this would
probably<00:06:56.010> be<00:06:56.430> a<00:06:56.460> good<00:06:56.639> option<00:06:57.030> like<00:06:57.510> I<00:06:57.570> said

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
probably be a good option like I said

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.680 
probably be a good option like I said
the<00:06:58.050> where<00:06:58.199> time<00:06:58.440> is<00:06:58.470> great<00:06:58.889> but<00:06:59.639> if<00:07:00.030> you<00:07:00.090> like

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
the where time is great but if you like

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.629 
the where time is great but if you like
to<00:07:00.990> do<00:07:01.139> things<00:07:01.380> very<00:07:01.560> precisely<00:07:02.160> if<00:07:02.460> you<00:07:02.520> have

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
to do things very precisely if you have

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.830 
to do things very precisely if you have
a<00:07:02.669> certain<00:07:02.849> way<00:07:03.000> of<00:07:03.030> doing<00:07:03.180> things<00:07:03.449> you<00:07:03.690> want

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
a certain way of doing things you want

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.960 
a certain way of doing things you want
to<00:07:03.930> have<00:07:04.080> a<00:07:04.110> very<00:07:04.550> measured<00:07:05.550> and<00:07:05.699> precise

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
to have a very measured and precise

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.850 
to have a very measured and precise
flick<00:07:06.389> at<00:07:06.570> the<00:07:06.599> end<00:07:06.720> of<00:07:06.900> your<00:07:06.990> liner<00:07:07.260> you<00:07:07.440> need

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
flick at the end of your liner you need

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.589 
flick at the end of your liner you need
the<00:07:07.979> curb<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.280> be<00:07:08.610> right<00:07:08.820> then<00:07:09.060> don't<00:07:09.330> get<00:07:09.449> this

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
the curb to be right then don't get this

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.000 
the curb to be right then don't get this
liner<00:07:09.840> it's<00:07:10.169> just<00:07:10.470> not<00:07:10.620> going<00:07:10.740> to<00:07:10.800> work<00:07:10.860> for

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
liner it's just not going to work for

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.760 
liner it's just not going to work for
you<00:07:11.220> but<00:07:11.940> overall<00:07:12.419> I<00:07:12.539> was<00:07:12.930> extremely<00:07:13.260> pleased

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
you but overall I was extremely pleased

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.830 
you but overall I was extremely pleased
especially<00:07:14.070> considering<00:07:15.060> that<00:07:15.090> this<00:07:15.510> is<00:07:15.810> a

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
especially considering that this is a

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.230 
especially considering that this is a
drugstore<00:07:16.229> liner<00:07:16.710> so<00:07:17.010> I<00:07:17.070> don't<00:07:17.550> have<00:07:17.699> that<00:07:17.729> I

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
drugstore liner so I don't have that I

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.060 
drugstore liner so I don't have that I
have<00:07:18.660> an<00:07:18.780> expectation<00:07:19.050> and<00:07:19.650> this<00:07:19.830> definitely

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
have an expectation and this definitely

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.480 
have an expectation and this definitely
exceeded<00:07:21.000> it<00:07:21.240> for<00:07:21.419> me<00:07:21.570> so<00:07:21.900> yeah<00:07:22.770> I<00:07:22.800> am<00:07:23.130> happy

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490 
exceeded it for me so yeah I am happy

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.980 
exceeded it for me so yeah I am happy
with<00:07:23.610> this<00:07:23.760> NYC<00:07:24.120> liner<00:07:24.539> I'll<00:07:24.750> definitely

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
with this NYC liner I'll definitely

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.379 
with this NYC liner I'll definitely
reach<00:07:25.680> forward<00:07:26.039> again<00:07:26.280> probably<00:07:26.610> not<00:07:26.849> all<00:07:27.060> the

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:27.389 
reach forward again probably not all the

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:28.559 
reach forward again probably not all the
time<00:07:27.539> but

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:28.569 
time but

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:31.559 
time but
I<00:07:28.649> performed<00:07:29.649> very<00:07:29.919> well<00:07:29.979> I<00:07:30.129> have<00:07:30.369> to<00:07:30.550> say<00:07:30.580> so
