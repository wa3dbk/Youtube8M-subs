00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
doing what you love I think that that's

very<00:01:12.810> possible<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.560> anybody<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.010> doesn't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
very possible for anybody it doesn't

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.380 
very possible for anybody it doesn't
matter<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.520> many<00:01:14.640> people<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:14.970> doing<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.360> just

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
matter how many people are doing it just

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.850

enough<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:15.990> around<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.770> they

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
enough to go around and I think they

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
enough to go around and I think they
just<00:01:17.070> need<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> proper<00:01:17.540> proper<00:01:18.540> motivation

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
just need the proper proper motivation

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830 
just need the proper proper motivation
and<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.490> constantly<00:01:21.330> being<00:01:21.630> told

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and just you know constantly being told

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.090 
and just you know constantly being told
that<00:01:21.960> whatever<00:01:22.259> good<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.650> possible

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that whatever good and it's possible

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.320 
that whatever good and it's possible
that<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.400> worth<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.180> keep

doing<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> that's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
doing it so I think that just the that's
