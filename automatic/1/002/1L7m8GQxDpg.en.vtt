guys most you guys would benefit from

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.470 
guys most you guys would benefit from
coming<00:02:35.019> into<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.440> corner<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.010> gym

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
coming into the corner of the gym

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.080 
coming into the corner of the gym
finding<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.379> machine<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.099> learning<00:02:38.940> how<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
finding this machine and learning how to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.119 
finding this machine and learning how to
engage<00:02:39.269> your<00:02:39.599> lats<00:02:39.840> taking<00:02:40.530> away<00:02:40.739> some<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
engage your lats taking away some of the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.520 
engage your lats taking away some of the
body<00:02:41.340> weight<00:02:41.549> because<00:02:41.849> most<00:02:42.060> guys<00:02:42.239> are<00:02:43.019> not

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
body weight because most guys are not

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.350 
body weight because most guys are not
using<00:02:43.920> their<00:02:44.040> back<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> dewlap<00:02:44.909> pulldown

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
using their back with a dewlap pulldown

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.000 
using their back with a dewlap pulldown
so<00:02:45.599> using<00:02:45.870> momentum<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> lot<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.590> guys<00:02:46.709> aren't

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
so using momentum a lot of guys aren't

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.559 
so using momentum a lot of guys aren't
using<00:02:47.220> their<00:02:47.459> back<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.879> their<00:02:48.060> seat<00:02:48.269> just

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
using their back on their seat just

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.270 
using their back on their seat just
bodyweight<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.890> pull-ups

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
bodyweight up is the pull-ups

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
bodyweight up is the pull-ups
because<00:02:50.700> they're<00:02:50.970> banking<00:02:51.780> through<00:02:51.930> their

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
because they're banking through their

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.309 
because they're banking through their
arms<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.739> they're<00:02:52.860> learning<00:02:52.980> how<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.670> a

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
arms and they're learning how to do it a

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.900 
arms and they're learning how to do it a
lot<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.440> speed<00:02:55.709> momentum<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.549> your<00:02:56.670> goals

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
lot of speed momentum so if your goals

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.000 
lot of speed momentum so if your goals
