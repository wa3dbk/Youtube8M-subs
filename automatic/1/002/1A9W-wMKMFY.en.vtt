coming season winning yeah like litter I
i<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:35.100> start<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> season<00:01:35.970> well

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
i think if we can start the season well

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
i think if we can start the season well
and<00:01:36.720> strike<00:01:36.990> fear<00:01:37.350> into<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.890> opposition

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and strike fear into the opposition

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
and strike fear into the opposition
again<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.030> did<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
again like we did I think we can take it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
again like we did I think we can take it
yeah<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.659> Chelsea

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
yeah because like if you look at Chelsea

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
yeah because like if you look at Chelsea
