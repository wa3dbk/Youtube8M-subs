video<00:00:21.119> because<00:00:21.710> these<00:00:22.710> mobs<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.340> just

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
video because these mobs you can just

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.509 
video because these mobs you can just
ignore<00:00:23.760> completely<00:00:24.449> now<00:00:25.050> back<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.340> old

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
ignore completely now back in the old

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
ignore completely now back in the old
days<00:00:26.670> those<00:00:27.150> mobs<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.599> cause<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.080> quite<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
days those mobs would cause do quite a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.250 
days those mobs would cause do quite a
bit<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.340> trouble<00:00:29.750> but<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:30.900> which<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> love

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
bit of trouble but now which you love

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.479 
bit of trouble but now which you love
later<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.890> completely<00:00:32.189> ignore

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
later you can just completely ignore

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
later you can just completely ignore
them<00:00:32.660> which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> good<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.350> they

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
them which is a good thing because they

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.850 
them which is a good thing because they
are<00:00:34.890> quite<00:00:35.100> nasty<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.940> abilities<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.660> do

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
are quite nasty the abilities they do

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
are quite nasty the abilities they do
however<00:00:37.860> these<00:00:38.190> mobs<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.640> cannot<00:00:38.879> ignore<00:00:39.030> but

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
however these mobs you cannot ignore but

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
however these mobs you cannot ignore but
they're<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> difficult<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.260> kill

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
they're not that difficult to kill

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.470 
they're not that difficult to kill
anyway<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.969> it<00:00:41.969> doesn't<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.300> matter

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
anyway so it doesn't really matter

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970 
anyway so it doesn't really matter
because<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.620> there<00:00:43.920> are

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
because as you can see there are

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
because as you can see there are
proteins<00:00:44.219> faunas<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.270> corpses<00:00:45.629> yeah

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
proteins faunas and these corpses yeah

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.160 
proteins faunas and these corpses yeah
the<00:00:46.500> corpses<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> floor<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.539> why<00:00:48.750> else

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the corpses on the floor what why else

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
the corpses on the floor what why else
would<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.649> blood<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.520> cops<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
would there be blood of cops and the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
would there be blood of cops and the
flow<00:00:51.270> except<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> mobs<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
flow except if they have mobs in them so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.080 
flow except if they have mobs in them so
yeah<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.649> right<00:00:56.460> after<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
yeah you just go to the right after you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
yeah you just go to the right after you
exit<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:58.289> pathway<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
exit that little pathway here and you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
exit that little pathway here and you
will<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> arcane<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> container<00:01:00.840> where

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
will go to the arcane in container where

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.470 
will go to the arcane in container where
you<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.949> third<00:01:02.340> fragment<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you will get the third fragment of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.289 
you will get the third fragment of the
key<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.820> toast<00:01:06.119> on

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
key now you can just toast on

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.630 
key now you can just toast on
immediately<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.080> somehow<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.860> managed<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
immediately but somehow I managed to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.060 
immediately but somehow I managed to
pull<00:01:08.790> aggro<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.570> negative<00:01:10.290> quark

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
pull aggro off this negative quark

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.940 
pull aggro off this negative quark
master<00:01:11.549> again<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:12.540> mobs<00:01:12.840> caused<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.680> be

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
master again these mobs caused can be

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.030 
master again these mobs caused can be
pork<00:01:14.310> could<00:01:14.970> cause<00:01:15.299> quite<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> damage

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
pork could cause quite a bit of damage

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.960 
pork could cause quite a bit of damage
because<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.400> too<00:01:17.520> low<00:01:17.670> health

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
because when they get too low health

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
because when they get too low health
they<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> stacking<00:01:18.930> buff<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.890> increases

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
they get a stacking buff which increases

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.999 
they get a stacking buff which increases
their<00:01:20.580> shadow<00:01:20.880> damaged<00:01:21.420> by<00:01:21.840> quite<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> lot

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
their shadow damaged by quite a lot

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.320 
their shadow damaged by quite a lot
actually<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.780> now<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.259> dead<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.799> who<00:01:26.130> cares

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
actually but now it's dead so who cares

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
actually but now it's dead so who cares
after<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.540> back<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> talk<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.259> cat<00:01:28.439> girl<00:01:28.740> he

the easiest bosses in the burning

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.469 
the easiest bosses in the burning
crusade<00:04:41.020> he<00:04:41.469> was<00:04:41.590> even<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.699> easiest<00:04:43.120> heroic

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
crusade he was even the easiest heroic

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.059 
crusade he was even the easiest heroic
bosses<00:04:43.629> anyway<00:04:44.199> for<00:04:44.349> the<00:04:44.379> burning<00:04:44.620> crusade<00:04:44.680> he

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
bosses anyway for the burning crusade he

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.529 
bosses anyway for the burning crusade he
was<00:04:45.189> there's<00:04:45.759> only<00:04:45.849> because<00:04:46.300> all<00:04:46.449> he

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
was there's only because all he

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.390 
was there's only because all he
basically<00:04:46.930> does<00:04:47.169> is<00:04:47.349> a<00:04:47.379> whirlwind<00:04:47.650> he<00:04:48.250> also

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
basically does is a whirlwind he also

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.420 
basically does is a whirlwind he also
does<00:04:48.610> something<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.449> do<00:04:49.539> with<00:04:49.659> the<00:04:49.750> tank<00:04:50.020> but

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
does something to do with the tank but

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.920 
does something to do with the tank but
mostly<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:51.669> just<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.909> whirlwind<00:04:52.270> which

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
mostly it's just the whirlwind which

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.540 
mostly it's just the whirlwind which
means<00:04:53.169> he's<00:04:53.349> extremely<00:04:53.680> easy<00:04:53.979> to<00:04:54.039> kill<00:04:54.280> and

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
means he's extremely easy to kill and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.360 
means he's extremely easy to kill and
very<00:04:54.969> very<00:04:55.300> easy<00:04:55.509> as<00:04:55.990> long<00:04:56.259> as<00:04:56.469> casters<00:04:57.069> or

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
very very easy as long as casters or

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.240 
very very easy as long as casters or
ranged<00:04:57.969> people<00:04:58.300> don't<00:04:58.509> stand<00:04:58.810> right<00:04:59.680> next<00:05:00.009> to

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
ranged people don't stand right next to

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.519 
ranged people don't stand right next to
him<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.699> you're<00:05:00.819> gonna<00:05:00.939> kill<00:05:01.150> him<00:05:01.319> but<00:05:02.319> really

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:02.529 
him and you're gonna kill him but really

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.019 
him and you're gonna kill him but really
now<00:05:02.770> that's<00:05:02.979> not<00:05:03.129> really<00:05:03.400> useful<00:05:03.759> advice

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.029 
now that's not really useful advice

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.879

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
of this keep and in the next video we're

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.890 
of this keep and in the next video we're
going<00:05:24.159> to<00:05:24.250> be<00:05:24.370> doing<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:25.000> rest<00:05:25.300> during<00:05:25.689> whole

going to be doing the rest during whole
keep<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.099> think<00:05:27.339> we<00:05:27.520> won't<00:05:27.729> be<00:05:27.879> actually

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
keep and I think we won't be actually

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.790 
keep and I think we won't be actually
going<00:05:28.539> to<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.839> black<00:05:28.990> morass<00:05:29.259> in<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.529> next

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800 
going to the black morass in the next
video<00:05:30.039> I<00:05:30.310> think<00:05:30.729> that<00:05:30.879> would<00:05:31.000> be<00:05:31.120> reserved<00:05:31.569> for
