00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.380 

yesterday<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:53.870> had<00:00:54.019> plenty<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:54.530> snow<00:00:55.149> first<00:00:56.149> of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
yesterday we had plenty of snow first of

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.439 
yesterday we had plenty of snow first of
all<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.019> we<00:00:57.199> woke<00:00:57.379> up<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.800> had<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.070> rob<00:00:58.449> ten

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
all so we woke up and had to rob ten

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.930 
all so we woke up and had to rob ten
centimeter<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.109> snow<00:01:00.260> was<00:01:00.949> not<00:01:01.250> possible<00:01:01.579> to

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
centimeter of snow was not possible to

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.389 
centimeter of snow was not possible to
do<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.300> longer<00:01:02.570> ride<00:01:02.839> because<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:03.320> was<00:01:03.500> too<00:01:04.159> cold

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
do a longer ride because it was too cold

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.060 
do a longer ride because it was too cold
and<00:01:04.699> yeah<00:01:05.630> nobody<00:01:06.049> expected<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.890> would

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
and yeah nobody expected that it would

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.020 
and yeah nobody expected that it would
be<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.490> cold

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
be that cold

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:18.880 
be that cold
good<00:01:08.450> week<00:01:16.869> it's<00:01:17.869> interesting<00:01:18.200> for<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.680> job

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
good week it's interesting for the job

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.399 
good week it's interesting for the job
too<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.640> be<00:01:19.789> in<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.060> field<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.780> feel<00:01:21.110> what

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
too to be in the field and to feel what

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.649 
too to be in the field and to feel what
are<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.280> real<00:01:22.460> problems<00:01:22.970> because<00:01:23.479> when

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
are the real problems because when

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.059 
are the real problems because when
you're<00:01:23.780> at<00:01:23.930> your<00:01:23.960> desk<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.590> do<00:01:24.830> some

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
you're at your desk and do some

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.399 
you're at your desk and do some
programming<00:01:25.460> you're<00:01:25.909> far<00:01:26.720> away<00:01:26.899> from<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
programming you're far away from the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.410 
programming you're far away from the
real<00:01:28.039> reality<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.030> field

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.160 

under<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.320> smart<00:01:35.890> bicycle<00:01:36.520> there<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.390> four<00:01:37.810> SS

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
under the smart bicycle there is four SS

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.859 
under the smart bicycle there is four SS
level<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.070> there<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.460> for<00:01:39.869> regenerative

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
level and there is for regenerative

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.649 
level and there is for regenerative
level<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.070> it's<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.400> same<00:01:42.640> motor<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.299> is<00:01:43.330> in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
level so it's the same motor that is in

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.760 
level so it's the same motor that is in
the<00:01:43.840> rear<00:01:44.649> wheel<00:01:44.860> when<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.030> ask<00:01:46.330> torque<00:01:47.110> from

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
the rear wheel when you ask torque from

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.469 
the rear wheel when you ask torque from
the<00:01:47.920> motor<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.460> drained<00:01:48.820> power<00:01:49.090> from<00:01:49.330> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
the motor it drained power from the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.230 
the motor it drained power from the
battery<00:01:49.810> but<00:01:49.990> give<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.470> some<00:01:50.740> torque<00:01:51.369> but

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
battery but give you some torque but

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.570 
battery but give you some torque but
when<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.600> do<00:01:52.750> regenerative<00:01:53.530> braking<00:01:54.009> the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
when you do regenerative braking the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.639 
when you do regenerative braking the
motor<00:01:54.789> will<00:01:55.119> change<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.509> little<00:01:55.600> bit<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.259> field

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
motor will change a little bit it field

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.609 
motor will change a little bit it field
orientation<00:01:57.479> electrically<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:59.200> instead<00:01:59.560> of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
orientation electrically so instead of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.950 
orientation electrically so instead of
pulling<00:02:00.039> voltage<00:02:00.880> from<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.509> battery<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:01.899> will

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
pulling voltage from the battery it will

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.760 
pulling voltage from the battery it will
be<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.950> generator<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.840> will<00:02:05.289> push

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
be like a generator so you will push

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.960 
be like a generator so you will push
back<00:02:06.009> some<00:02:06.429> Kuran<00:02:07.270> toward<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.019> battery<00:02:08.380> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
back some Kuran toward the battery and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.270 
back some Kuran toward the battery and
this<00:02:09.970> feeling<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.750> richer<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.500> richer<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.950> FF

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
this feeling of richer and richer and FF

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.910 
this feeling of richer and richer and FF
breaking<00:02:12.790> will<00:02:13.390> be<00:02:13.569> different<00:02:13.989> in<00:02:14.410> regard<00:02:14.830> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
breaking will be different in regard to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
breaking will be different in regard to
the<00:02:15.100> speed<00:02:15.400> because<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:15.880> you're<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.959> go

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
the speed because if you're you go

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.860 
the speed because if you're you go
faster<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> bike<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:19.209> possibility<00:02:19.840> of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
faster with the bike the possibility of

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.320 
faster with the bike the possibility of
for<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.799> same<00:02:21.010> torque<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.580> will<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:21.970> able<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
for the same torque you will be able to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330 
for the same torque you will be able to
put<00:02:22.480> more<00:02:22.660> power<00:02:22.900> toward<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> battery<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:24.220> are

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
put more power toward the battery we are

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.039 
put more power toward the battery we are
pretty<00:02:24.610> sure<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.540> bike<00:02:25.750> will<00:02:26.019> be

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
pretty sure that this bike will be

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.280 
pretty sure that this bike will be
mainly<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.560> cities<00:02:26.980> with<00:02:27.220> less<00:02:27.670> slope<00:02:28.299> but<00:02:29.049> by

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
mainly in cities with less slope but by

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.590 
mainly in cities with less slope but by
testing<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.040> higher<00:02:30.489> slope<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:31.150> can<00:02:31.330> see

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
testing it and higher slope we can see

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.559 
testing it and higher slope we can see
how<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.870> will<00:02:32.019> react<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:33.030> think<00:02:34.030> we<00:02:34.150> figure<00:02:34.450> out

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
how it will react I think we figure out

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.470 
how it will react I think we figure out
some<00:02:34.870> good<00:02:35.230> calibration<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:36.370> will<00:02:37.299> satisfy

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
some good calibration that will satisfy
