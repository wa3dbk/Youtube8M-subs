00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.890
 on the other hand let's try 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.509
 see how it works in my opinion 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.119
 just notice 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.430
 on protective equipment that everyone 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.720

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.990
 paint the device almost undamaged 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.990
 despite the fact that I'm pretty strong kill 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.300

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.430
 no film and all electronic 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.430
