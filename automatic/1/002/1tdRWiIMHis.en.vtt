00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 between boys and welcome back on the canal 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.160
 rom managers are here in the parking lot 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 of the gym 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 today in fact I will have an element of di 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 shoulders is a chest booster and many of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.559
 you have asked me how to warm up 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.210
 before an element is then thought of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.970
 make this quick video before mine 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 workout I see that very often in 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.920
 gym there are guys that despite 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 just train the body so not 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 I know my back my chest my shoulders 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 however, they always do 30 times 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.000
 minutes of cardio on the treadmill on the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
 stationary bikes and then go to the area 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.040
 stretching for dynamic stretching 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 or static stretching always for the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 legs mainly here are 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 agree on the speech to enter 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 gym make a moment of activity 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
 cardiovascular to improve anyway 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.940
 the supply of blood oxygen in the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 muscles 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809
 however when it comes to heating 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 we must always concentrate, of course 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.530
 on the muscle group we go to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 train then with regard to the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
 subscribed online or legs yes I do 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.870
 ten minutes of cardio usually five 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 minutes five minute bike steppes 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 while instead when I train the perboni 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.299
 then back to chest 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.560
 I focus on cardio for that ones 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.270
 muscle districts 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 then the usual rower or a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 crosstrainer of the technogym that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.150
 I have seen it is also present in many 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 gyms in Italy and then what it is 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.450
 fundamental first of all to begin 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.689
 the training and are obviously the series 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 of approaching the training weight 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.890
 so the heating sets are 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.950
 absolutely important so i don't know 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.680
 if you go to the legs for the squat they are salt 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.240
 that help you find the right one 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.659
 depth of the accused if you do chest 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.399
 they are series that help you feel good 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 and work the chest in the peak of 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.520
 contractions to involve the chest in the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.189
 in the exercise shoulders the same thing 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 fundamental equal back than of 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.950
 usually for the back I do if lady 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.720
 pullover for the chest warms it maybe 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.700
 with a car trying to 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.040
 to bring the chest out and to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.620
 focus on the contraction of del 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.240
 bib in exercise and so on 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.000
 so the heating evenings are 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.490
 are critical it is to bring 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.400
 blood to the muscle but also to get used to 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.370
 and the mind to the movement that will go 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.030
 to do then in the work out then 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.820
 always consider the evenings of 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.220
 heating and usually try to 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.260
 increase the weight gradually in these 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.190
 heating approach nights 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.020
 but start with 10 repetitions with a 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.330
 50 percent weight of yours 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.220
 ceiling then slowly you approach 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.240
 obviously to the training weight and then 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.640
 always for the body 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.160
 I usually do many armies for the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.459
 rotator cuff is just for 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.140
 warm up that area again 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.250
 instead with regards to stretching 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.350
 many also asked me for stretching 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.500
 when to do it obviously a video 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.150
 dedicated to this but stretching 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.390
 I usually don't do it in the phase of 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 heating but mostly during or 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.670
 at the end of the training a lot 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.000
 dynamic stretching stretching with weight 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.019
 during and then stress instead of static 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.360
 end of training 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.880
 the only exception when I do legs 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.140
 I'm going to do stretching and above all 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.850
 for the lumbar 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.640
 but the lower back is not for 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.980
 the legs simply because when 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 I shake, I press and I don't want to 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.080
 having trouble 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.850
 let's say in the one where the del area 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.560
 body then doing killing I find myself 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.840
 much better and I can have one 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.780
 greater mobility in movement 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.590
 especially in the shakes and so this 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.370
 that's all 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.900
 hence to summarize series of 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.860
 approach will be discreetly are 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.510
 basic and if you want some cardio 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.489
 let's say initial but obviously dedicated 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.400
 to the muscle group you go to train 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.720
 rotator cuff exercises are 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.090
 fundamental 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.200
 I would say to insert them in the phase of 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.410
 heating especially when 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.700
 train your shoulders or chest well this is 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.359
 let me know what you think 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.470
 also what are your ways to 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.099
 warm up and see you soon 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.099
 Hi guys
