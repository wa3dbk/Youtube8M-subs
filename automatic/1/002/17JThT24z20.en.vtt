public thoroughfare and to me there's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.900 
public thoroughfare and to me there's
absolutely<00:02:32.379> nothing<00:02:32.769> wrong<00:02:33.220> with<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.640> rule

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
absolutely nothing wrong with that rule

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
his face and two by using his right hand

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.459 
his face and two by using his right hand
that's<00:06:35.819> where<00:06:36.029> the<00:06:36.150> tradition<00:06:36.659> of<00:06:36.779> the<00:06:37.229> right

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
that's where the tradition of the right

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.070 
that's where the tradition of the right
hand<00:06:37.830> came<00:06:38.099> into<00:06:38.340> play<00:06:38.669> because<00:06:39.360> most<00:06:39.659> people

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
hand came into play because most people

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.249 
hand came into play because most people
were<00:06:40.830> and<00:06:41.189> are<00:06:41.520> right-handed<00:06:42.360> it<00:06:42.539> showed<00:06:43.229> that

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
were and are right-handed it showed that

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.249 
were and are right-handed it showed that
you<00:06:43.560> did<00:06:43.979> not<00:06:44.129> have<00:06:44.189> your<00:06:44.699> hand<00:06:45.000> on<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.719> weapon

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
you did not have your hand on a weapon

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.189 
you did not have your hand on a weapon
so<00:06:47.189> essentially<00:06:47.969> it<00:06:48.090> was<00:06:48.210> a<00:06:48.270> gesture<00:06:49.169> of

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
so essentially it was a gesture of

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.459 
so essentially it was a gesture of
friendliness<00:06:50.069> and<00:06:50.479> both<00:06:51.479> saluting<00:06:52.259> and

friendliness and both saluting and

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.640 
friendliness and both saluting and
tipping<00:06:53.189> your<00:06:53.370> hat<00:06:53.750> mimics<00:06:54.750> the<00:06:54.960> gesture<00:06:55.620> of

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
tipping your hat mimics the gesture of

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.320 
tipping your hat mimics the gesture of
