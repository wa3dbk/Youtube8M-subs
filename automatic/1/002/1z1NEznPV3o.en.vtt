controversy there where the controversy

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
controversy there where the controversy
exists<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> frequently<00:01:20.189> when<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
exists is that frequently when in this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
exists is that frequently when in this
process<00:01:21.689> where<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> hydrogenate<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> oils

process where you hydrogenate the oils

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
process where you hydrogenate the oils
that<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.939> typically<00:01:24.509> occurs<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.470> they're

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that it typically occurs that they're

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.300 
that it typically occurs that they're
saturated<00:01:26.159> fat<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.490> saturated<00:01:26.729> fat<00:01:27.509> has<00:01:27.960> been

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310

health care professionals are just

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.120 
health care professionals are just
simply<00:01:35.340> confused<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:37.130> don't

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
simply confused about this and don't

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.120

another<00:02:45.360> some<00:02:45.600> cautions<00:02:46.200> about<00:02:46.410> coconut<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
another some cautions about coconut you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
another some cautions about coconut you
may<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.520> may<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.260> has<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
may or may not know in that it has a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.950 
may or may not know in that it has a
relatively<00:02:50.100> high<00:02:50.310> melting<00:02:50.910> point<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.570> that

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
relatively high melting point and that

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.370 
relatively high melting point and that
means<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:53.100> most<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.550> us<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.180> solid<00:02:55.170> at

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
means for most of us it is a solid at

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.070 
means for most of us it is a solid at
room<00:02:55.440> temperature<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.490> turns<00:02:57.120> liquid<00:02:57.540> about

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
room temperature it turns liquid about

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.890 
room temperature it turns liquid about
76<00:02:58.800> degrees<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.580> put<00:02:59.850> coconut<00:03:00.120> oil<00:03:00.360> in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
76 degrees so if you put coconut oil in

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.390 
76 degrees so if you put coconut oil in
the<00:03:01.020> fridge<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.710> going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.130> very

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the fridge it's going to be very

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.050 
the fridge it's going to be very
difficult<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:04.110> scoop<00:03:04.470> out<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.160> you'd<00:03:05.880> want

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
difficult to to scoop out so you'd want

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.370 
difficult to to scoop out so you'd want
to<00:03:06.180> store<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.220> temperature<00:03:08.220> closer<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.730> 76

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
to store it in temperature closer to 76

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.170 
to store it in temperature closer to 76
so<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.710> way<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.920> will<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.040> easy<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.610> remove

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
so so this way it will be easy to remove

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.230 
so so this way it will be easy to remove
now<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.320> has<00:03:13.470> many<00:03:13.770> health<00:03:14.250> benefits<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> seems

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
now it has many health benefits it seems

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.510 
now it has many health benefits it seems
to<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> very<00:03:16.470> effective<00:03:16.800> supporter<00:03:17.490> of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
you need it in very small amounts so

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.439 
you need it in very small amounts so
that<00:04:46.620> happens<00:04:47.610> very<00:04:47.819> rarely<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.330> that's

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
that happens very rarely but that's

all<00:05:07.349> additionally<00:05:08.280> many<00:05:08.430> people<00:05:08.699> find<00:05:08.909> that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
all additionally many people find that

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.779 
all additionally many people find that
it's<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.630> useful<00:05:10.169> oil<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.860> cook<00:05:11.130> in<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.460> an

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
it's a useful oil to cook in as an

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.080 
it's a useful oil to cook in as an
alternative<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.419> olive<00:05:12.840> oil<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:14.090> tends

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
alternative to olive oil it tends

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.390 
alternative to olive oil it tends
because<00:05:15.449> there's<00:05:15.659> so<00:05:15.810> much<00:05:15.930> saturated<00:05:16.380> fat<00:05:16.500> it

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
because there's so much saturated fat it

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.390 
because there's so much saturated fat it
is<00:05:17.729> very<00:05:18.060> difficult<00:05:18.539> to<00:05:18.949> oxidize<00:05:19.949> any<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
is very difficult to oxidize any of the

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.070 
is very difficult to oxidize any of the
fats<00:05:20.819> in<00:05:21.000> there<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.270> as<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.419> result<00:05:21.569> it's<00:05:21.900> less

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
fats in there so as a result it's less

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.050 
fats in there so as a result it's less
damaged<00:05:22.530> when<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.740> heat<00:05:22.949> it<00:05:22.979> but<00:05:23.190> ideally<00:05:23.550> the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
damaged when you heat it but ideally the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.939 
damaged when you heat it but ideally the
bulk<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.360> your<00:05:24.419> food<00:05:25.080> should<00:05:25.349> be<00:05:25.380> raw<00:05:25.680> and

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
bulk of your food should be raw and

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.890 
bulk of your food should be raw and
uncooked<00:05:26.819> but<00:05:27.030> if<00:05:27.120> for<00:05:27.270> some<00:05:27.360> reason<00:05:27.780> you're

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
uncooked but if for some reason you're

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.360 
uncooked but if for some reason you're
going<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.199> choose<00:05:28.409> to<00:05:28.470> cook<00:05:28.740> food<00:05:28.979> then

going to choose to cook food then

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.589 
going to choose to cook food then
coconut<00:05:29.759> oil<00:05:29.909> would<00:05:30.060> be<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> good<00:05:30.330> oil<00:05:30.389> to

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
coconut oil would be a good oil to

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:31.850 
coconut oil would be a good oil to
consider<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:30.990> hopefully<00:05:31.259> this<00:05:31.349> information

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860
