00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
kind of a it's not like a glossy finish

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
kind of a it's not like a glossy finish
and<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> soft<00:02:02.009> ton<00:02:02.280> it's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and it's not really like a soft ton it's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
and it's not really like a soft ton it's
more<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.909> matte<00:02:03.360> hard<00:02:03.840> plastic<00:02:04.500> finish

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
more of like a matte hard plastic finish

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
more of like a matte hard plastic finish
on<00:02:05.130> both<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> these<00:02:06.180> cases<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.869> they're<00:02:07.020> not

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
on both of these cases so they're not

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.839 
on both of these cases so they're not
going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> show<00:02:07.649> fingerprints<00:02:08.280> or<00:02:08.520> scuffs

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
going to show fingerprints or scuffs

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.240 
going to show fingerprints or scuffs
nearly<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.420> easily<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:10.289> say<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> high-gloss

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
nearly as easily as say a high-gloss

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.250 
nearly as easily as say a high-gloss
finish<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.940> anything

like<00:02:12.379> that<00:02:12.819> now<00:02:13.819> all<00:02:14.000> four<00:02:14.330> corners<00:02:14.629> actually

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
like that now all four corners actually

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.949 
like that now all four corners actually
have<00:02:15.739> some<00:02:15.950> reinforced<00:02:16.670> material<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.720> if<00:02:17.840> you

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
have some reinforced material so if you

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.780 
have some reinforced material so if you
do<00:02:18.200> drop<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.799> phone<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.040> any<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:19.579> of<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
do drop your phone on any one of the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.729 
do drop your phone on any one of the
four<00:02:20.000> corners<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.720> are<00:02:20.900> protected<00:02:21.590> and

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
four corners you are protected and

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.399 
four corners you are protected and
here's<00:02:22.549> where<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> actual<00:02:23.360> dual<00:02:23.870> material

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
here's where the actual dual material

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.110 
here's where the actual dual material
comes<00:02:24.650> into<00:02:24.890> play<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.129> have<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.579> very<00:02:25.760> hard

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
comes into play you have the very hard

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.600 
comes into play you have the very hard
probably<00:02:26.599> carbonate<00:02:27.019> back<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.099> then<00:02:28.459> you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
probably carbonate back and then you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.910 
probably carbonate back and then you
have<00:02:28.849> this<00:02:29.000> kind<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.329> nice<00:02:29.540> soft<00:02:29.930> TPU<00:02:30.500> material
