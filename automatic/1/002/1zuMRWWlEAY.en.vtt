00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.010 
it actually will recommend that you
score<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.820> little<00:02:11.000> bit<00:02:11.210> out<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.690> then<00:02:11.780> put

score it a little bit out and then put

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.480 
score it a little bit out and then put
it<00:02:12.170> back<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.800> your<00:02:12.920> hair

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
after you're done washing it so I have

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.070 
after you're done washing it so I have
tried<00:02:16.220> not<00:02:17.150> doing<00:02:17.630> that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
tried not doing that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.400 
tried not doing that
I<00:02:18.110> have<00:02:18.320> tried<00:02:18.610> doing<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.820> both<00:02:20.570> ways<00:02:20.900> at

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
I have tried doing that both ways at

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.260 
I have tried doing that both ways at
least<00:02:21.770> residue<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.370> my<00:02:22.490> hair<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.940> it'll

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
least residue in my hair like it'll

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.390 
least residue in my hair like it'll
leave<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.600> little<00:02:24.010> sometimes<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.160> little

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
leave like little sometimes like little

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.940 
leave like little sometimes like little
flakes<00:02:25.670> or<00:02:26.030> it'll<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.330> be<00:02:26.600> dull<00:02:26.930> or<00:02:27.620> it'll

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
flakes or it'll just be dull or it'll

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.070 
flakes or it'll just be dull or it'll
feel<00:02:28.190> weighed<00:02:28.640> down<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:29.270> when<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.450> flatiron

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
feel weighed down like when I flatiron

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.660 
feel weighed down like when I flatiron
it<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.410> doesn't<00:02:30.590> want<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> flat<00:02:31.130> iron<00:02:31.340> right

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
it it doesn't want a flat iron right

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.590 
it it doesn't want a flat iron right
because<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.240> just<00:02:32.540> smells<00:02:32.810> heavy<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:34.600> there

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
because it just smells heavy so there

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.410 
because it just smells heavy so there
was<00:02:35.750> no<00:02:35.930> way<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.140> get<00:02:36.380> around<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.420> I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
was no way to get around that and I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.100 
was no way to get around that and I
would<00:02:39.380> still<00:02:39.650> recommend<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:40.190> product<00:02:40.550> just

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
would still recommend this product just

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.290 
would still recommend this product just
keep<00:02:42.110> your<00:02:42.260> other<00:02:42.410> shampoo<00:02:42.950> because<00:02:43.460> you<00:02:44.120> will

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
keep your other shampoo because you will

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.330 
keep your other shampoo because you will
need<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.870> cleanse<00:02:45.230> your<00:02:45.470> hair<00:02:45.770> after<00:02:46.010> you've

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
need to cleanse your hair after you've

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.880 
need to cleanse your hair after you've

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
been using this for a little while this

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.670 
been using this for a little while this
works<00:02:49.250> very<00:02:49.700> well<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.210> conjunction<00:02:50.450> with<00:02:51.200> an

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
works very well in conjunction with an

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.430 
works very well in conjunction with an
additional<00:02:52.280> shampoo<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.420> has<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.600> detergent

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
additional shampoo that has a detergent

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.830 
additional shampoo that has a detergent
I<00:02:54.590> actually<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.490> washed<00:02:55.700> my<00:02:55.850> hair<00:02:55.940> two<00:02:56.660> days

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
I actually just washed my hair two days

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.390 
I actually just washed my hair two days
ago<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:58.040> used<00:02:58.340> my<00:02:58.670> regular<00:02:59.030> shampoo<00:02:59.750> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
ago and I used my regular shampoo and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.220 
ago and I used my regular shampoo and
you<00:03:01.400> see<00:03:01.580> how<00:03:01.790> it's<00:03:02.120> very<00:03:02.480> straight<00:03:02.870> very

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
you see how it's very straight very

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.440 
you see how it's very straight very
shiny<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:04.340> since<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.760> had<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.060> residue<00:03:05.420> from

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
shiny like since I had the residue from

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.350 
shiny like since I had the residue from
this<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.020> it<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.680> didn't<00:03:07.040> feel<00:03:07.190> like<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.700> but

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
this in it it didn't feel like that but

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.630 
this in it it didn't feel like that but
it<00:03:08.600> was<00:03:08.630> still<00:03:08.960> manageable<00:03:09.500> because<00:03:10.310> I've

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
it was still manageable because I've

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.430 
it was still manageable because I've
been<00:03:10.880> using<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.600> few<00:03:11.780> months<00:03:11.990> so<00:03:12.050> it's

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
been using this for a few months so it's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.200 
been using this for a few months so it's
kind<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.680> changed<00:03:13.190> away<00:03:13.430> my<00:03:13.610> hair<00:03:13.820> behaves

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
kind of changed away my hair behaves

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.500 
kind of changed away my hair behaves
when<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:14.600> wet<00:03:14.950> okay<00:03:15.950> very<00:03:16.190> quickly<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:17.180> tea

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
when it's wet okay very quickly the tea

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
conditioner I wouldn't recommend buying

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.310 
conditioner I wouldn't recommend buying
this<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.790> not<00:03:32.120> worth<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.420> money<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:33.050> don't

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
this it's not worth the money I don't

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.960 
this it's not worth the money I don't
see<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.770> it<00:03:33.950> changes<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.580> way<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.820> hair

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
see that it changes the way the hair

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.510 
see that it changes the way the hair
feels<00:03:35.330> I<00:03:35.720> don't<00:03:36.560> see<00:03:37.100> any<00:03:37.280> additional

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
feels I don't see any additional

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.820 
feels I don't see any additional
benefits<00:03:38.210> from<00:03:38.330> using<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.200> can<00:03:39.230> also<00:03:39.500> use

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
benefits from using it you can also use

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.150 
benefits from using it you can also use
it<00:03:40.040> on<00:03:40.250> your<00:03:40.460> body<00:03:40.700> as<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:42.800> not<00:03:42.920> like<00:03:42.980> a
