consistency of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.510 
consistency of
this<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.240> also<00:02:27.480> very<00:02:27.990> flowy<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.130> liquidy

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
this is also very flowy and like liquidy

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120 
this is also very flowy and like liquidy
so<00:02:29.790> once<00:02:30.030> again<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:30.780> thick<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.260> like<00:02:31.470> the

so once again not as thick and like the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.560

curl enhancing smoothie from the cookin

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.020 
curl enhancing smoothie from the cookin
in<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.690> design<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.920> part<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:35.430> natural

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
in the design this part is for natural

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.520 
in the design this part is for natural
animal<00:02:36.330> experience<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.050> guess<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.380> want

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
animal experience so I guess that I want

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.740 
animal experience so I guess that I want
to<00:02:37.590> make<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.800> too<00:02:37.950> thick<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.460> use<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.480> wet

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
to make it too thick I use it on wet

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780 
to make it too thick I use it on wet
hair<00:02:39.780> apps<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.890> mask<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.460> rinsed<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
hair apps I use the mask and rinsed it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.850 
hair apps I use the mask and rinsed it
out<00:02:41.850> as<00:02:42.690> soon<00:02:42.930> as<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.080> put<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.530> love<00:02:43.740> it

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
out as soon as I put it in I love it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.890 
out as soon as I put it in I love it
even<00:02:44.070> more<00:02:44.340> slick<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.210> mask<00:02:45.420> already<00:02:45.780> had

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
even more slick so the mask already had

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.470 
even more slick so the mask already had
my<00:02:46.080> hair<00:02:46.260> detangle<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.150> made<00:02:48.330> it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
my hair detangle and this just made it

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360 
my hair detangle and this just made it
even<00:02:48.630> better<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.320> was<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.530> double<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
even better so it was like double the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.400 
even better so it was like double the
slipperiness<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.540> makes<00:02:51.720> sense<00:02:51.900> right<00:02:52.170> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
slipperiness that makes sense right and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.020 
slipperiness that makes sense right and
now<00:02:53.130> I'm<00:02:53.310> going<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.520> talk<00:02:53.610> about<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.910> edge

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
now I'm going to talk about the edge

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.850 
now I'm going to talk about the edge
treatment<00:02:54.450> now<00:02:54.990> for<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.500> can't<00:02:55.710> really

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
treatment now for this I can't really

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.420 
treatment now for this I can't really
say<00:02:56.100> too<00:02:56.160> much<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.820> use<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.360> last<00:02:57.750> night<00:02:57.990> also

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
edge control it's an edge treatment so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120 
edge control it's an edge treatment so
