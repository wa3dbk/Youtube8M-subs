that's quite slow as you probably heard
and<00:02:57.410> yeah<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:59.090> could<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.239> lot<00:03:00.480> faster<00:03:01.880> but

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and yeah it could be a lot faster but

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.080 
and yeah it could be a lot faster but
anyway<00:03:04.950> oh<00:03:05.280> also<00:03:06.270> last<00:03:06.810> thing<00:03:07.110> I've<00:03:07.880> got<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
anyway oh also last thing I've got it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.680

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
counter on here so I can actually keep

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.910 
counter on here so I can actually keep
the<00:03:14.580> score<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.150> then<00:03:15.870> possibly<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> later

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920
