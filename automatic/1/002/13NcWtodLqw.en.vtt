00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.708
First of all happy New Year to everybody. I wish you all the best of health, luck and success in life.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.340
When you fail to win the Bundesliga championship for two years and then you finally win it everybody is happy again.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.520
However, in the past years Bayern Munich won the treble with Jupp and last year we won four titles 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.780
and two of them were the big and important ones in the league and the cup. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.000
I understand when people now say winning the league isn’t enough anymore. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.920
But I can only repeat that for me the Bundesliga is the most important title. 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.600
For me as a coach it’s a great and memorable season if you win the league championship. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
That is my opinion even if it doesn’t mean I don’t feel any pressure.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.340
I know how important the Champions league is for this club. 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.340
What I want is to play well and to improve the way the team plays every day. 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.700
If you win a game you are happy for a day or two. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.380
But if you play well you know you are coming closer to achieving your big goals. 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.300
My job and my goal is to make the team play better every day.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.840
I have to make the team feel comfortable and full of confidence going into the important games 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.840
of the season so that we can play well and preferably win. 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:32.140
To win the champions League is very much about the form you’re in on that day. 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.480
That’s what is most important in the champions League. 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.040
In the Bundesliga you play every day but I don’t know now what condition my team will be in 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.020
when we play against Shaktar Donetsk and when we possibly play in the quarter- or semi-finals. 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.400
I told Manuel Neuer the same thing I told Franck Ribery last season: go there and enjoy it. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.140
Don’t worry about winning. If you do win it that’s fantastic but if not it’s still a great achievement. 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.004
That’s the best thing you can do.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.340
Just like Franck last season Manuel has to be very proud of what he achieved. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.560
It is so difficult to be among the best three players in the world. And that is already good enough! 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.620
If he wins the award that’s great but if he doesn’t it won’t change our opinion about him 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.520
just like our opinion of Franck didn’t change either. 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:39.200
Winning or losing doesn’t matter: they deserve great respect. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.940
Manuel has already won in my opinion. 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:55.120
If you can fly to Zurich with the chance of winning this amazing award you’ve already achieved a great victory. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:05.260
That’s why he should travel to Zurich a happy man. I told him to go there and enjoy it. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.280
Of course all three nominated players are outstanding athletes and all three of them deserve to win it. 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.460
Manuel deserves to win it too and I hope he can win the Ballon D’Or.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.280
Normally field players have better chances of winning 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.620
because scoring goals is more spectacular than saving shots on goal. 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:40.300
But Manuel is an exceptional and outstanding player not only last season but in the past years altogether.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.680
I hope he can win and hope he enjoys himself in Zurich.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.360
I have great faith in the quality of Holger Badstuber. 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:10.080
All we have to worry about in his current situation is that he doesn’t sustain another injury.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.220
If he’s fit he is an absolute top player. 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:25.840
He showed outstanding performances before he sustained his most recent injury against Schalke. 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.080
Bastian Schweinsteiger wasn’t able to join us for the pre-season preparation in summer 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.900
but now he is fit and doesn’t have any problems with his knee anymore. 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.600
He played fantastic football in the last two or three matches before the winter break. 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.880
I hope he can maintain the condition he is in until the end of the season. 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:54.300
If we can show good performances and collect good results in the first five or six matches 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.360
after the break we will be in a great position to defend our league title.
