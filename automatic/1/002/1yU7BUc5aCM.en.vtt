00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
exactly like the other one except with

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.220 
exactly like the other one except with
gamma<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> side<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.880> gray

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
gamma on the side and the the gray

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
gamma on the side and the the gray
medals<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.500> white<00:00:25.769> metals<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.369> black<00:00:26.580> medals

medals or white metals or black medals

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.279 
medals or white metals or black medals
or<00:00:27.210> whatever<00:00:27.449> color<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.869> might<00:00:27.990> classify

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
or whatever color you might classify

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.470 
or whatever color you might classify
them<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.949> I'd<00:00:29.160> classify<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.119> grey

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
them as I'd classify them as grey

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.290 
them as I'd classify them as grey
because<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.099> color<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.579> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
because that's what that color is so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
because that's what that color is so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
but Gamal was a pretty interesting

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
but Gamal was a pretty interesting
design<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.930> hawkish<00:00:58.350> character<00:00:59.250> he<00:00:59.489> was

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
design a very hawkish character he was

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.650 
design a very hawkish character he was
the<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.680> brunt<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.129> Greed's<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the the brunt of the Greed's and it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.929 
the the brunt of the Greed's and it
really<00:01:03.870> showed<00:01:04.170> us<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> his<00:01:04.559> design<00:01:05.010> he's<00:01:05.700> got

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
really showed us in his design he's got

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.620 
really showed us in his design he's got
probably<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> biggest<00:01:07.439> big<00:01:08.100> yard's

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
probably one of the biggest big yard's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
probably one of the biggest big yard's
bases<00:01:09.630> ever<00:01:10.070> stands<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.189> things<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.640> Rock

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
bases ever stands like things like Rock

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.130 
bases ever stands like things like Rock
bison<00:01:12.439> but<00:01:13.439> he<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.159> huge<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
bison but he is huge and because of that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.820 
bison but he is huge and because of that
he<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:17.340> flaws<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.299> mainly<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.590> fact

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
he has some flaws and mainly the fact

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.050 
he has some flaws and mainly the fact
that<00:01:19.950> he<00:01:20.130> can't<00:01:20.369> move<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.000> crap<00:01:22.460> he<00:01:23.460> does<00:01:23.759> have

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that he can't move for crap he does have

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
that he can't move for crap he does have
had<00:01:24.270> articulation<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> does<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
had articulation and it does go all the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.399 
had articulation and it does go all the
way<00:01:26.220> around<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> plus

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
way around so that's a plus

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.060 
way around so that's a plus
except<00:01:29.340> he<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> limits<00:01:30.270> himself<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:31.070> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
except he kind of limits himself in the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.390 
except he kind of limits himself in the
vertical<00:01:32.610> motion<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:34.170> giant<00:01:34.890> piece<00:01:35.130> right

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
vertical motion this giant piece right

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.109 
vertical motion this giant piece right
here<00:01:35.670> does<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.270> upwards<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.310> quite

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
here does go upwards so you do get quite

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.730 
here does go upwards so you do get quite
a<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.360> articulation<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.500> things

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
a bit of articulation all things

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
a bit of articulation all things
considered<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.850> can't<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> full<00:01:42.509> rotation

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
considered you can't do a full rotation

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
considered you can't do a full rotation
obviously<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.299> he's<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:45.990> bad

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
obviously but he's actually not that bad

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.420 
obviously but he's actually not that bad
everything<00:01:48.960> else<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.470> questionable<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.399> best

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
everything else is questionable at best

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.780 
everything else is questionable at best
this<00:01:51.390> section<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.619> lot<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.250> separate

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this section is on a lot of separate

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.050 
this section is on a lot of separate
joints<00:01:54.530> but<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> doesn't<00:01:55.979> open<00:01:56.369> quite<00:01:56.700> enough

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
joints but it doesn't open quite enough

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.990 
joints but it doesn't open quite enough
and<00:01:57.360> his<00:01:58.110> thigh<00:01:58.469> armor<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.579> thick

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and his thigh armor is just so thick

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.920 
and his thigh armor is just so thick
that<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.659> can't<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
that you can't really get much more of a

that you can't really get much more of a
spread<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.630> thigh

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
little bit in there but it's not a lot

joints<00:02:22.170> down<00:02:22.349> here<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.010> simple<00:02:23.340> ball<00:02:23.519> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
joints down here just a simple ball and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.070 
joints down here just a simple ball and
socket<00:02:23.970> joint<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.330> they<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.659> little<00:02:24.870> bit

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
socket joint so they are a little bit

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.869 
socket joint so they are a little bit
loose<00:02:25.319> same<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.220> toe<00:02:26.430> joint<00:02:26.700> right

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
loose same with the toe joint right

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.910 
loose same with the toe joint right
there<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.989> do<00:02:28.080> get<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> double<00:02:28.319> joint<00:02:28.769> at

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
there but you do get the double joint at

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.280 
there but you do get the double joint at
the<00:02:28.950> knee<00:02:29.420> we<00:02:30.420> already<00:02:30.660> went<00:02:30.780> over<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.049> thighs

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the knee we already went over the thighs

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.460 
the knee we already went over the thighs
the<00:02:31.890> waist<00:02:32.190> movement<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.510> pretty<00:02:33.840> much<00:02:34.080> nil

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the waist movement is pretty much nil

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.860 
the waist movement is pretty much nil
you<00:02:34.830> get<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> tiny<00:02:35.610> bit<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.060> AB<00:02:36.239> crunch<00:02:36.629> right

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you get a tiny bit of AB crunch right

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.400 
you get a tiny bit of AB crunch right
there<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:38.129> large<00:02:38.610> piece<00:02:38.970> back<00:02:39.239> here

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
there but this large piece back here

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.339 
there but this large piece back here
kind<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.530> hinders<00:02:41.299> everything<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:43.260> can

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
kind of hinders everything and you can

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.350 
kind of hinders everything and you can
kind<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:43.769> doesn't<00:02:44.159> line<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.310> properly<00:02:45.209> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
kind of see doesn't line up properly and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.440 
kind of see doesn't line up properly and
it's<00:02:45.540> kind<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.019> hard<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> get<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:47.299> line<00:02:48.299> up

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it's kind of hard to get it to line up

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.650 
it's kind of hard to get it to line up
exactly<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> hopefully<00:02:50.910> I'll<00:02:51.060> stay<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> bit

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
exactly so hopefully I'll stay a bit

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.619 
exactly so hopefully I'll stay a bit
double<00:02:52.560> try<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.769> right<00:02:52.950> there<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.519> again<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
double try it right there but again the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.360 
double try it right there but again the
articulation<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.620> kind<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.920> hit<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.280> miss

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
articulation is kind of hit and miss

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.190 
articulation is kind of hit and miss
particularly<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.329> there<00:02:57.510> because<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:58.049> this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
particularly in there because of this

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.300 
particularly in there because of this
large<00:02:58.500> piece<00:02:59.010> right<00:02:59.400> here<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.180> arm<00:03:01.310> you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
large piece right here on the arm you

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.539 
large piece right here on the arm you
kind<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.180> squeeze<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.629> little<00:03:03.930> bit<00:03:04.109> too

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
kind of have to squeeze a little bit too

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.180 
kind of have to squeeze a little bit too
to<00:03:05.549> get<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.870> full<00:03:06.870> use<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.650> doubled<00:03:08.010> run

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
to get the full use of the doubled run

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.780 
to get the full use of the doubled run
right<00:03:08.370> there

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
right there

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.360 
right there
and<00:03:09.060> yes<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.900> joint<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.620> black<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> white

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and yes that joint is black on a white

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.250 
and yes that joint is black on a white
arm<00:03:11.790> people<00:03:12.569> can<00:03:13.019> complain<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:14.720> but<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.959> really

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
arm people can complain now but I really

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.470 
arm people can complain now but I really
do<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.859> design<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.310> gamal<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.239> like

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
do like the design of gamal and I like

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.470 
do like the design of gamal and I like
the<00:03:18.660> way<00:03:18.750> he<00:03:18.900> did<00:03:19.109> translate<00:03:19.560> into<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.919> figure

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
the way he did translate into a figure

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.240 
the way he did translate into a figure
the<00:03:21.480> articulation<00:03:22.319> isn't<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.739> bad<00:03:22.950> all

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the articulation isn't that bad all

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.150 
the articulation isn't that bad all
things<00:03:23.280> considered<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.780> could<00:03:25.139> be<00:03:25.290> better<00:03:25.500> but

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
things considered it could be better but

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.770 
things considered it could be better but
then<00:03:26.609> they'd<00:03:26.790> have<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:27.060> take<00:03:27.239> some<00:03:27.450> liberties

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
then they'd have to take some liberties

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.229 
then they'd have to take some liberties
with<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> design<00:03:28.440> or<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.760> way<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
with the design or just the way that the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.360 
with the design or just the way that the
figure<00:03:30.840> functions<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.769> would<00:03:32.040> rather<00:03:32.250> have

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
figure functions and I would rather have

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.390 
figure functions and I would rather have
a<00:03:32.579> nice<00:03:33.389> looking<00:03:33.870> slightly<00:03:34.769> less<00:03:34.950> functional

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
a nice looking slightly less functional

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.729 
a nice looking slightly less functional
figure<00:03:35.760> than<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.239> fully<00:03:36.989> functional<00:03:37.500> figure

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
figure than a fully functional figure

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.670 
figure than a fully functional figure
that<00:03:37.889> looks<00:03:38.099> like<00:03:38.280> poo<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.750> am<00:03:40.019> glad<00:03:40.440> they

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
that looks like poo so I am glad they

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.819 
that looks like poo so I am glad they
did<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.010> way<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.160> they<00:03:41.430> did<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.829> sculpt

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
did it the way that they did the sculpt

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.920 
did it the way that they did the sculpt
and<00:03:43.980> paint<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.430> absolutely<00:03:45.150> gorgeous<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
and paint is absolutely gorgeous and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.559 
and paint is absolutely gorgeous and
probably<00:03:46.590> one<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.829> my<00:03:47.099> favorites<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.209> four

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
probably one of my favorites of the four

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.620 
probably one of my favorites of the four
greens<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.169> were<00:03:49.290> initially<00:03:49.680> released<00:03:50.630> just

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
greens that were initially released just

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.830 
greens that were initially released just
because<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.989> do<00:03:52.139> get<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.470> ton<00:03:52.859> of<00:03:52.889> design<00:03:53.840> in

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
because you do get a ton of design in

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.750 
because you do get a ton of design in
all<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.470> his<00:03:55.620> little<00:03:55.829> crevices<00:03:56.430> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
all of his little crevices and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.839 
all of his little crevices and
everything<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.389> was<00:03:57.569> weird<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.989> say<00:03:58.200> but

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
everything that was weird to say but

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.839 
everything that was weird to say but
right<00:03:59.849> up<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.450> with<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.639> think<00:04:02.639> it's

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
right up here with the I think it's

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.599 
right up here with the I think it's
supposed<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.060> be<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.239> elephant<00:04:04.340> tusks<00:04:05.340> right

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
supposed to be the elephant tusks right

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.460 
supposed to be the elephant tusks right
here<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:05.970> cut<00:04:06.299> off<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:07.109> make<00:04:07.139> like<00:04:07.440> a

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
here that I cut off to make like a

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.099 
here that I cut off to make like a
little<00:04:07.560> battering<00:04:08.099> ram<00:04:08.280> or<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.549> gun<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:09.120> looks

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
little battering ram or a gun I looks

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.129 
little battering ram or a gun I looks
really<00:04:10.650> really<00:04:11.459> cool<00:04:11.699> and<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.540> wash<00:04:12.780> that

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
really really cool and the wash that

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.780 
really really cool and the wash that
they<00:04:13.319> used<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.769> go<00:04:13.919> from<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:14.220> black<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
they used to go from the black to the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.279 
they used to go from the black to the
white<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.180> gradient<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.840> there<00:04:16.049> looks

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
white and the gradient right there looks

this<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.840> balancing<00:05:27.530> Gamal<00:05:28.039> he's<00:05:28.220> all<00:05:28.669> sorts

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
this is balancing Gamal he's all sorts

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.690 
this is balancing Gamal he's all sorts
of<00:05:29.210> fun<00:05:29.539> ah

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
of fun ah

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.240 
of fun ah
but<00:05:31.700> yeah<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.090> can't<00:05:32.510> really<00:05:32.930> use<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.620> his

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
but yeah you can't really use it and his

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.820 
but yeah you can't really use it and his
stance<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.849> so<00:05:35.060> wide<00:05:35.330> that<00:05:35.690> he<00:05:36.169> just<00:05:36.530> kind<00:05:36.740> of

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
stance is so wide that he just kind of

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.830 
stance is so wide that he just kind of
stands<00:05:37.130> on<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.669> sell<00:05:37.880> medals<00:05:38.240> as<00:05:38.389> opposed<00:05:38.690> to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
stands on the sell medals as opposed to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.920 
stands on the sell medals as opposed to
in<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.050> sell<00:05:39.530> medals<00:05:39.860> so<00:05:40.820> this<00:05:41.479> stage<00:05:41.750> is

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
in the sell medals so this stage is

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.790 
in the sell medals so this stage is
pretty<00:05:42.169> much<00:05:42.970> pointless<00:05:43.970> when<00:05:44.210> it<00:05:44.330> comes<00:05:44.510> to

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
pretty much pointless when it comes to

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.600 
pretty much pointless when it comes to
the<00:05:45.800> Gamal<00:05:46.250> um<00:05:47.560> normally<00:05:48.560> I<00:05:48.830> would<00:05:49.160> do<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.340> bunch

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
the Gamal um normally I would do a bunch

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
the Gamal um normally I would do a bunch
of<00:05:49.729> posing<00:05:50.150> montages<00:05:50.950> but<00:05:51.950> let's<00:05:52.699> just<00:05:53.330> cut

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
of posing montages but let's just cut

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.439 
of posing montages but let's just cut
right<00:05:53.660> to<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.139> chase<00:05:54.260> because<00:05:54.919> he's<00:05:55.449> camel

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
right to the chase because he's camel

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.330 
right to the chase because he's camel
and<00:05:56.630> there<00:05:56.810> really<00:05:57.020> isn't<00:05:57.289> anything<00:05:57.680> else<00:05:57.949> for

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
and there really isn't anything else for

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.650 
and there really isn't anything else for
him<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.669> do<00:05:58.820> except<00:05:59.270> stand<00:05:59.870> there<00:06:00.820> so<00:06:01.820> camel<00:06:02.449> is

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
him to do except stand there so camel is

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.469 
him to do except stand there so camel is
all<00:06:02.930> sorts<00:06:03.349> of<00:06:03.470> awesome<00:06:03.800> in<00:06:04.280> sculpt<00:06:04.760> built<00:06:05.330> in

all sorts of awesome in sculpt built in
a<00:06:05.570> figure<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.080> just<00:06:06.110> doesn't<00:06:06.650> have<00:06:06.830> that

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
a figure that just doesn't have that

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.980 
a figure that just doesn't have that
much<00:06:07.220> playability<00:06:07.729> given<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.389> fact<00:06:08.660> he<00:06:08.780> comes

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
much playability given the fact he comes

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.900 
much playability given the fact he comes
with<00:06:09.139> two<00:06:09.320> hands<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:09.740> a<00:06:09.860> stage<00:06:10.099> he<00:06:10.280> can't<00:06:10.550> use

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
with two hands and a stage he can't use

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.420 
with two hands and a stage he can't use
plus<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:12.080> limited<00:06:12.410> articulation<00:06:12.590> and

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
plus the limited articulation and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.650 
plus the limited articulation and
there's<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.699> amount<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:14.000> poses<00:06:14.389> you<00:06:14.510> can

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
there's the amount of poses you can

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.370 
there's the amount of poses you can
actually<00:06:14.840> do<00:06:15.669> so<00:06:16.669> it's<00:06:17.449> kind<00:06:17.810> of<00:06:18.020> hit<00:06:18.229> or<00:06:18.260> miss

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
actually do so it's kind of hit or miss

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.610 
actually do so it's kind of hit or miss
if<00:06:18.860> you<00:06:19.370> did<00:06:19.610> really<00:06:19.820> like<00:06:20.180> Gamal<00:06:20.900> then<00:06:21.320> I<00:06:21.349> do

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
if you did really like Gamal then I do

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.170 
if you did really like Gamal then I do
definitely<00:06:22.310> recommend<00:06:22.669> picking<00:06:22.880> up<00:06:23.000> the

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
definitely recommend picking up the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.159 
definitely recommend picking up the
figure<00:06:23.479> because<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:23.960> only<00:06:24.080> other

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
figure because the only other

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.409 
figure because the only other
representation<00:06:24.919> was<00:06:25.039> a<00:06:25.070> vinyl<00:06:25.370> figure<00:06:25.849> so<00:06:26.360> if

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
representation was a vinyl figure so if

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.670 
representation was a vinyl figure so if
you<00:06:26.479> want<00:06:26.660> something<00:06:26.930> with<00:06:27.169> at<00:06:27.289> least<00:06:27.440> some

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
you want something with at least some

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.110 
you want something with at least some
pose<00:06:27.919> ability<00:06:28.340> then<00:06:28.520> this<00:06:28.639> is<00:06:28.760> really<00:06:29.000> the

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
pose ability then this is really the

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.810 
pose ability then this is really the
only<00:06:29.150> option<00:06:29.360> you<00:06:29.720> got<00:06:30.580> but<00:06:31.580> if<00:06:31.699> you're

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
only option you got but if you're

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.040 
only option you got but if you're
looking<00:06:32.090> for<00:06:32.210> a<00:06:32.270> little<00:06:32.390> bit<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:32.630> cheap<00:06:32.840> route

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
looking for a little bit the cheap route

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.690 
looking for a little bit the cheap route
the<00:06:33.289> vinyl<00:06:33.650> figures<00:06:33.950> weren't<00:06:34.219> actually<00:06:34.520> that

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
the vinyl figures weren't actually that

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.040 
the vinyl figures weren't actually that
bad<00:06:34.849> for<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.210> greed<00:06:35.419> so<00:06:35.690> I<00:06:35.750> do<00:06:35.840> recommend

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
bad for the greed so I do recommend

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.900 
bad for the greed so I do recommend
taking

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
taking

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.160 
taking
those<00:06:37.180> of<00:06:37.360> you<00:06:37.450> want<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:37.750> little<00:06:37.960> bit<00:06:38.050> of<00:06:38.110> a

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
those of you want a little bit of a

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.590 
those of you want a little bit of a
cheaper<00:06:38.500> option<00:06:38.530> you<00:06:39.490> can<00:06:39.760> find<00:06:40.090> gamma<00:06:40.330> on<00:06:40.510> the

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
cheaper option you can find gamma on the

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.800 
cheaper option you can find gamma on the
secondary<00:06:40.960> market<00:06:41.080> but<00:06:41.620> again<00:06:42.480> these<00:06:43.480> guys

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
secondary market but again these guys

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.810 
secondary market but again these guys
are<00:06:44.140> getting<00:06:44.440> sold<00:06:44.680> to<00:06:45.220> where<00:06:45.400> they're

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
are getting sold to where they're

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.340 
are getting sold to where they're
getting<00:06:46.030> harder<00:06:46.180> to<00:06:46.420> find<00:06:46.660> and<00:06:46.900> so<00:06:47.020> the<00:06:47.140> price

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
getting harder to find and so the price

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.220 
getting harder to find and so the price
has<00:06:47.380> gone<00:06:47.590> up<00:06:47.950> a<00:06:48.070> little<00:06:48.250> bit<00:06:48.690> compared<00:06:49.690> to<00:06:49.750> arc

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
has gone up a little bit compared to arc

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.980 
has gone up a little bit compared to arc

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
they're actually a little bit cheaper
