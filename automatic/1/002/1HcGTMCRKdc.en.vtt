00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.069
 that's the ripped poppes now 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:10.849
 curry which is now the leading to the castle 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.849
 I complained it out 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 i am christian ear from salmon and today 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 I'm going to show you how such a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 really fat spongetech does and indeed 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.779
 with purple curry and the whole thing will 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.309
 combined with beetroot and raspberries 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:40.590
 So far, what is very important, of course 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.500
 really fresh you just make four 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 pure eggs and then make two more 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.219
 single yolk afterwards so come then 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.840
 50 grams of sugar we put back on 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.870
 make new and nourish it with that 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.770
 Also exactly the 60 grams if you use it too 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.690
 a lot or too little sugar or something 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.930
 the whole spongetech seems to her off and on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:13.860
 that's really the most important thing exactly 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.140
 So really shitty really is 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.780
 complicated and spongetech to do and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.340
 look at the camera 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 which is still crucial now 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 the liquid always has to be 120 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.920
 milliliters of water and the spice 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.390
 what has the taste of the purple curry 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.119
 as the name suggests it is because 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.950
 specials so purple and the color comes 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.590
 simply from dried hibiscus flowers 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.520
 and beetroot powder anyone can do that for 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.619
 decide for yourself how much 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720
 intensity he wants to have third 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.159
 the second ingredient is dried red 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.540
 I'll stay where I am a little bit more 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.100
 the color of the protect afterwards properly 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.020
 it started at a beautiful flat 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 me so that I somehow stop 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.619
 passion from eating extremely much 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.659
 All my money was gone 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 has popped on the head for that has 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.110
 I somehow showed that too 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.470
 someday to be able to us yes 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.900
 I started this way to try 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.720

 gastronomy modern gastronomy 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.420
 at least not indispensable 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.190
 everyone will look easy with this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.730
 Microwave while baking yourself 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.790
 put in between and then this one 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.050
