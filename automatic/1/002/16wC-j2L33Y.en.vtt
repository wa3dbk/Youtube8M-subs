00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.370 

so<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.770> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.190> be<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.580> on

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
so this is going to be a video on

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.300 
so this is going to be a video on
electronic<00:00:04.380> reliability<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:04.950> temperature

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
electronic reliability in temperature

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.120 
electronic reliability in temperature
basically<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.940> have<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.779> filled<00:00:07.080> bulb<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.770> it

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
basically I have this filled bulb and it

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.000 
basically I have this filled bulb and it
came<00:00:08.280> with<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.550> really<00:00:09.090> low<00:00:09.480> warranty<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.440> is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
came with a really low warranty and is

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.560 
came with a really low warranty and is
wondering<00:00:11.370> if<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:11.849> there's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
wondering if that was because there's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.030 
wondering if that was because there's
very<00:00:12.870> little<00:00:12.990> confidence<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.710> part<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.950> this

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
very little confidence the part of this

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.029 
very little confidence the part of this
manufacturer<00:00:14.790> regarding<00:00:15.330> its<00:00:15.450> design<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.139> if

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
manufacturer regarding its design or if

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
manufacturer regarding its design or if
they<00:00:17.160> decide<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.520> lower<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.910> warranty<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
they decide to lower the warranty to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.960 
they decide to lower the warranty to
almost<00:00:19.529> zero<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.340> they<00:00:20.460> could<00:00:20.520> offer<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
almost zero just so they could offer the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
almost zero just so they could offer the
product<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> lower<00:00:21.570> possible<00:00:22.109> price<00:00:22.320> um

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
product of the lower possible price um

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.279 
product of the lower possible price um
let<00:00:23.400> me<00:00:23.430> insert<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.939> thermograph<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.960> bulb<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
let me insert a thermograph this bulb is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.529 
let me insert a thermograph this bulb is
using<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:26.939> over<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
using it and you can see over here is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.790 
using it and you can see over here is
basically<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> hottest<00:00:28.470> part<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
basically the hottest part of the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.540 
basically the hottest part of the
Baldwin<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.400> standing<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.250> problem

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
Baldwin was standing out and the problem

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.770 
Baldwin was standing out and the problem
thermograph<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.090> course<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> only<00:00:33.480> looks<00:00:33.690> at

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
thermograph of course it only looks at

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
thermograph of course it only looks at
the<00:00:33.899> outside<00:00:34.200> shell<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> part<00:00:35.040> whatever<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the outside shell the part whatever you

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.180 
the outside shell the part whatever you
want<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.850> take<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.059> look<00:00:36.210> inside<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.020> see

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
want to do is take a look inside and see

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
want to do is take a look inside and see
what<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> exact<00:00:38.579> dye<00:00:38.820> temperature<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.480> from

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
what the exact dye temperature is from

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.360 
what the exact dye temperature is from
that<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:40.770> some<00:00:40.829> reliability

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that I can actually get some reliability

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.940 
that I can actually get some reliability
tables<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.809> start<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> estimate<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.739> how

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
tables and start to estimate how how

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.229 
tables and start to estimate how how
well<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.460> particular<00:00:45.000> assembly<00:00:45.270> performs

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
well this particular assembly performs

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.459 
well this particular assembly performs
so<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> go-to<00:00:48.600> component<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.440> course

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so the go-to component will be of course

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.380 
so the go-to component will be of course
a<00:00:49.739> thermocouple<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.430> one's<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> key<00:00:50.879> type<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
a thermocouple this one's a key type and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.430 
a thermocouple this one's a key type and
there's<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.660> course<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> thermometer<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
there's of course the thermometer that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.000 
there's of course the thermometer that
goes<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
goes with it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.830 
goes with it
this<00:00:53.610> particular<00:00:54.059> thermocouple<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.629> really

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this particular thermocouple is really

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
this particular thermocouple is really
well<00:00:54.989> suited<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.590> task<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
well suited to this task because it's a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
well suited to this task because it's a
really<00:00:56.820> small<00:00:57.149> end<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> even<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
really small end to it and even the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.470 
really small end to it and even the
cable<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.100> skinny<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> that's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
cable is very skinny and that's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.369 
cable is very skinny and that's
important<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.109> gonna<00:01:01.199> need<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
important because I'm gonna need to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
important because I'm gonna need to
drill<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> hole<00:01:01.649> into<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> bulb<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
drill a hole into this bulb for the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
drill a hole into this bulb for the
cable<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> come<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.439> wanted<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
cable to come out and I wanted to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
cable to come out and I wanted to
disturb<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> assembly<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.330> as

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
disturb the assembly as little as

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
disturb the assembly as little as
possible<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> create<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.830> accurate

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
possible if I want to create an accurate

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.270 
possible if I want to create an accurate
measurement<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> led<00:01:09.720> temperature<00:01:10.280> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
measurement of the led temperature and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.740 
measurement of the led temperature and
it<00:01:11.400> won't<00:01:11.549> reduce<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.420> air<00:01:12.600> as

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it won't reduce it as little air as

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.770 
it won't reduce it as little air as
possible<00:01:14.090> okay<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.150> I've<00:01:15.390> drilled<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> little

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
possible okay so I've drilled a little

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
possible okay so I've drilled a little
tiny<00:01:16.110> hole<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> sufficient<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> allow

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tiny hole in that sufficient to allow

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.300 
tiny hole in that sufficient to allow
the<00:01:17.790> thermocouple<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> pass<00:01:18.930> through<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the thermocouple to pass through the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.440 
the thermocouple to pass through the
next<00:01:20.520> thing<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> worry<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
next thing I need to worry about is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
next thing I need to worry about is
getting<00:01:21.479> enough<00:01:21.900> thermal<00:01:22.110> transfer<00:01:22.650> between

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
getting enough thermal transfer between

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
getting enough thermal transfer between
the<00:01:22.950> thermocouple<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> LED<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> do

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the thermocouple and the LED and to do

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.289 
the thermocouple and the LED and to do
that<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.759> some<00:01:26.939> thermal

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that I'm going to put some thermal

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
that I'm going to put some thermal
compound<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> LED<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.189> actually

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
compound on the LED and I was actually

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030 
compound on the LED and I was actually
hoping<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> use<00:01:30.140> actually<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.439> thermally

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
hoping to use actually a thermally

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.179 
hoping to use actually a thermally
conductive<00:01:32.579> epoxy<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.470> unfortunately<00:01:35.070> my

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
conductive epoxy but unfortunately my

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
conductive epoxy but unfortunately my
local<00:01:35.400> electronics<00:01:36.060> store<00:01:36.090> had<00:01:36.360> sold<00:01:36.720> out

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
local electronics store had sold out

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300 
local electronics store had sold out
when<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> went<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.380> today<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.159> some

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
when I went down today to look for some

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
when I went down today to look for some
so<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.360> dab<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.770> challenge

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
so I'm gonna dab this on the challenge

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.230 
so I'm gonna dab this on the challenge
here<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.520> need<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> still<00:01:42.000> somehow

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
here because I need to still somehow

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
here because I need to still somehow
mechanically<00:01:42.930> secure<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> wire<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
mechanically secure the wire so it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
mechanically secure the wire so it
doesn't<00:01:45.149> move<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> assembly<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> screw

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
using Kapton tape to secure it they also

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.789 
using Kapton tape to secure it they also
need<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.780> use<00:01:54.840> some<00:01:55.020> cap<00:01:55.200> down<00:01:55.380> along<00:01:55.649> the

then<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.150> want<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.330> look<00:03:19.420> at<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.570> number<00:03:19.750> of

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
then you want to look at the number of

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.340 
then you want to look at the number of
hours<00:03:19.990> before<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.270> bulbs<00:03:22.270> cumulative<00:03:23.020> light

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
hours before the bulbs cumulative light

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.400 
hours before the bulbs cumulative light
output<00:03:23.650> decreases<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:25.960> see<00:03:26.140> here

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
output decreases now you can see here

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.770 
output decreases now you can see here
I'll<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.620> highlight<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.280> 105<00:03:28.060> degree<00:03:28.390> curve

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
I'll just highlight the 105 degree curve

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.330 
I'll just highlight the 105 degree curve
you<00:03:28.960> can<00:03:29.080> see<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.350> course<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.920> bottom

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
you can see of course it's the bottom

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.340 
you can see of course it's the bottom
here<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.450> log<00:03:31.690> graph<00:03:31.990> on<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.320> bottom

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
here it's a log graph on the bottom

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.110 
here it's a log graph on the bottom
terms<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.980> hours<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.490> of<00:03:33.550> course<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.880> drops

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
terms of hours and of course it drops

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.920 
terms of hours and of course it drops
off<00:03:34.360> quite<00:03:34.870> dramatically<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:37.000> mid<00:03:37.240> curve<00:03:37.540> yet

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
off quite dramatically the mid curve yet

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.200 
off quite dramatically the mid curve yet
85<00:03:38.350> degrees<00:03:38.710> centigrade<00:03:39.250> looking<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.090> little

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
85 degrees centigrade looking a little

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.510 
85 degrees centigrade looking a little
bit<00:03:40.390> better<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.900> then<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.710> course<00:03:41.770> it's<00:03:42.040> 55

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
bit better and then of course it's 55

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.490 
bit better and then of course it's 55
you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.760> see<00:03:42.970> it's<00:03:43.150> almost<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.840> flat<00:03:43.960> line<00:03:44.290> out

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
you can see it's almost a flat line out

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.190 
you can see it's almost a flat line out
to<00:03:44.830> number<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.820> tens<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.210> thousands<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.780> hours

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
to number of tens of thousands of hours

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.800 
to number of tens of thousands of hours
so<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:48.820> sort<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.210> dramatic

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
so you get sort of this dramatic

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.140 
so you get sort of this dramatic
exponential<00:03:50.650> function<00:03:51.220> that's<00:03:51.820> true<00:03:52.000> all

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
exponential function that's true all

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.720 
exponential function that's true all
electronics<00:03:52.780> LEDs<00:03:53.110> are<00:03:53.230> not<00:03:53.380> unique<00:03:53.730> there's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
electronics LEDs are not unique there's

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.460 
electronics LEDs are not unique there's
an<00:03:54.820> exponential<00:03:55.330> function<00:03:55.510> with<00:03:56.350> the

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
an exponential function with the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.890 
an exponential function with the
relation<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.130> temperature<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.910> reliability

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
relation of temperature and reliability

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.880 
relation of temperature and reliability
so<00:03:59.700> an<00:04:00.700> interesting<00:04:01.150> interesting<00:04:02.140> problem

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
so an interesting interesting problem

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.280 
so an interesting interesting problem
that<00:04:02.920> they're<00:04:03.220> facing

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
that they're facing

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.350 
that they're facing
okay<00:04:05.290> well<00:04:05.850> definitely<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.910> larger

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
okay well definitely a larger

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.790 
okay well definitely a larger
temperature<00:04:07.780> rise<00:04:07.959> from<00:04:08.110> what<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.290> measured<00:04:08.680> on

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
temperature rise from what I measured on

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.410 
temperature rise from what I measured on
this<00:04:08.950> bulb<00:04:09.160> compared<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:09.700> its<00:04:09.820> predecessor

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
this bulb compared to its predecessor

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.740 
this bulb compared to its predecessor
and<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:11.560> should<00:04:11.830> lead<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.400> lower<00:04:12.750> service

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
and that should lead to a lower service

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.630 
and that should lead to a lower service
life<00:04:13.959> which<00:04:14.200> may<00:04:14.500> explain<00:04:14.860> why<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.160> warranty

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
life which may explain why the warranty

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.120 
life which may explain why the warranty
this<00:04:15.790> balmy<00:04:16.120> is<00:04:16.209> quite<00:04:16.480> short<00:04:16.830> when<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:17.859> look<00:04:18.010> at

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
this balmy is quite short when I look at

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.979 
this balmy is quite short when I look at
Philips<00:04:18.820> main<00:04:19.060> competitor<00:04:19.630> they've<00:04:19.780> also

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
Philips main competitor they've also

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.050 
Philips main competitor they've also
tried<00:04:20.590> this<00:04:20.739> assembly<00:04:21.280> where<00:04:21.460> they<00:04:21.609> put<00:04:21.850> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
tried this assembly where they put a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.600 
tried this assembly where they put a
circuit<00:04:22.630> board<00:04:22.780> in

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
circuit board in

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.279 
circuit board in
essentially<00:04:24.120> acting<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.509> the<00:04:24.629> heat<00:04:24.780> sink<00:04:25.050> a

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
essentially acting like the heat sink a

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.890 
essentially acting like the heat sink a
heavily<00:04:25.620> plated<00:04:26.009> and<00:04:26.939> they've<00:04:27.539> made<00:04:27.659> one

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
heavily plated and they've made one

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.629 
heavily plated and they've made one
major<00:04:28.110> difference<00:04:28.409> so<00:04:28.740> they<00:04:28.860> put<00:04:29.069> some<00:04:29.250> fins

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
major difference so they put some fins

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.309 
major difference so they put some fins
into<00:04:29.879> their<00:04:30.090> bulbs<00:04:30.479> basically<00:04:31.080> they<00:04:31.199> can

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
into their bulbs basically they can

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.679 
into their bulbs basically they can
create<00:04:31.530> an<00:04:31.620> airflow<00:04:32.009> through<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:33.000> the
