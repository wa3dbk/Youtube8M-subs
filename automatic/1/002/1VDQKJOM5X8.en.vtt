and<00:01:54.350> I'm<00:01:54.500> also<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:56.060> assist<00:01:56.420> leader<00:01:56.570> believe

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and I'm also the assist leader believe

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.270 
and I'm also the assist leader believe
it<00:01:57.110> or<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.260> because<00:01:57.470> when<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.830> was<00:01:57.979> having<00:01:58.130> my

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
it or not because when I was having my

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370 
it or not because when I was having my
drought<00:01:58.640> matches<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.210> was<00:01:59.900> always<00:02:00.080> getting

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
drought matches I was always getting

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.500 
drought matches I was always getting
assists<00:02:00.740> left<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.220> right<00:02:01.370> so<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:01.909> really

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
assists left and right so that really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.420 
assists left and right so that really
paid<00:02:02.810> off<00:02:02.840> for<00:02:02.990> me<00:02:03.260> but<00:02:03.500> getting<00:02:04.070> into<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
paid off for me but getting into the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.180 
paid off for me but getting into the
match<00:02:04.610> with<00:02:05.380> montrell<00:02:06.380> impact<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:06.950> just

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
match with montrell impact is just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.440 
match with montrell impact is just
another<00:02:07.460> one<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.729> those<00:02:07.909> games<00:02:08.119> where<00:02:08.299> they

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
another one of those games where they

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.289 
another one of those games where they
have<00:02:08.810> possession<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.040> pressure<00:02:10.369> really

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
have possession but we pressure really

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.240 
have possession but we pressure really
really<00:02:11.540> well<00:02:11.720> especially<00:02:11.840> me<00:02:12.470> i<00:02:12.500> really<00:02:13.100> like

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
really well especially me i really like

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.250 
really well especially me i really like
marking<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.880> then<00:02:14.000> telling<00:02:14.330> my<00:02:14.420> teammates<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
marking and then telling my teammates to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.949 
marking and then telling my teammates to
pressure<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.980> man<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.280> ball<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:17.570> i<00:02:17.750> get

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
pressure the man on the ball and i get

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.300 
pressure the man on the ball and i get
the<00:02:18.110> ball<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.470> i<00:02:18.560> always<00:02:18.739> create<00:02:19.130> something

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
the ball and i always create something

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.759 
the ball and i always create something
from<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.390> see<00:02:20.570> there<00:02:20.840> they<00:02:21.320> assist

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
from it and as you see there they assist

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.699 
from it and as you see there they assist
leader<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.459> top<00:02:22.790> scorer<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.570> league

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
leader and the top scorer in the league

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.320 
leader and the top scorer in the league
so<00:02:24.709> what<00:02:25.010> else<00:02:25.190> do<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.489> want<00:02:25.760> from<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.970> look

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
so what else do you want from that look

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.580 
so what else do you want from that look
at<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.540> beautiful<00:02:26.870> chip<00:02:27.260> through<00:02:27.440> bow

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
at that beautiful chip through bow

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410 
at that beautiful chip through bow
that's<00:02:27.799> probably<00:02:28.130> how<00:02:28.310> i<00:02:28.340> got<00:02:28.670> all<00:02:29.090> these

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
that's probably how i got all these

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.150 
that's probably how i got all these
assists<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.049> they<00:02:30.230> do<00:02:30.290> hit<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.769> poster<00:02:31.100> i

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
thing that kind of sounds a little mean

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.030 
thing that kind of sounds a little mean
but<00:02:59.239> he<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.110> he's<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.560> only<00:03:00.770> play

Impact<00:03:03.049> weren't<00:03:03.560> causing<00:03:03.769> any<00:03:04.069> problems<00:03:04.189> to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
Impact weren't causing any problems to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.160 
Impact weren't causing any problems to
us<00:03:04.790> we<00:03:04.939> are<00:03:05.060> causing<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.629> many<00:03:05.750> problems<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
us we are causing so many problems to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.140 
us we are causing so many problems to
them<00:03:06.349> look<00:03:06.439> at<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:06.650> breakaway<00:03:07.099> here<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.609> I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
them look at this breakaway here and I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.000 
them look at this breakaway here and I
guess<00:03:08.390> my<00:03:08.599> strength<00:03:09.019> does<00:03:09.379> come<00:03:09.620> into<00:03:09.829> play

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
guess my strength does come into play

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.800 
guess my strength does come into play
there<00:03:10.040> because<00:03:10.519> another<00:03:11.000> player<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.569> my

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
there because another player of my

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.649 
there because another player of my
height<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:13.280> less<00:03:13.489> less<00:03:14.000> trend<00:03:14.269> that<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.480> have

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
height with less less trend that I have

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.089 
height with less less trend that I have
because<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.930> have<00:03:15.079> 72<00:03:15.590> or<00:03:15.680> something<00:03:15.950> right<00:03:16.040> now

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
because I have 72 or something right now

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.890 
because I have 72 or something right now
would<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.819> probably<00:03:17.060> gone<00:03:17.329> down<00:03:17.599> but<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
would have probably gone down but the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.690 
would have probably gone down but the
first<00:03:18.109> matte<00:03:18.319> finishes<00:03:18.920> with<00:03:19.099> me<00:03:19.129> mad<00:03:19.519> at<00:03:19.640> the

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
game and I'm pretty sure this one is

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.519 
game and I'm pretty sure this one is
actually<00:06:20.089> in<00:06:20.509> the<00:06:20.659> league<00:06:20.839> because<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.319> first

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529 
actually in the league because the first

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.819 
actually in the league because the first
match<00:06:21.740> with<00:06:22.990> with<00:06:23.990> the<00:06:24.110> first<00:06:24.319> Canadian<00:06:24.499> team

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.219 
past one player and then I really should

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
have I've only recently learned how to

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.169 
have I've only recently learned how to
take<00:06:48.559> that<00:06:48.709> finish<00:06:49.009> you<00:06:49.129> have<00:06:49.279> to<00:06:49.459> finesse<00:06:49.999> it

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:50.179

around<00:06:50.419> the<00:06:50.749> goalkeeper<00:06:51.199> with<00:06:51.379> a<00:06:51.409> minimal

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:51.769 
around the goalkeeper with a minimal

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:54.009 
around the goalkeeper with a minimal
power<00:06:51.979> but<00:06:52.219> I<00:06:52.249> just<00:06:52.459> try<00:06:52.579> to<00:06:52.610> power<00:06:52.999> it<00:06:53.209> in<00:06:53.659> in

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:54.019 
power but I just try to power it in in

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:56.589 
power but I just try to power it in in
the<00:06:54.319> the<00:06:54.619> far<00:06:54.829> post<00:06:55.039> and<00:06:55.339> then<00:06:55.789> I<00:06:55.849> actually<00:06:56.119> get

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 
the the far post and then I actually get

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.449 
the the far post and then I actually get
a<00:06:56.839> header<00:06:57.079> from<00:06:57.349> a<00:06:57.439> corner<00:06:57.529> if<00:06:58.039> that<00:06:58.249> had<00:06:58.429> gone

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:58.459 
a header from a corner if that had gone

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.129 
a header from a corner if that had gone
in<00:06:58.819> that<00:06:58.999> would<00:06:59.149> have<00:06:59.240> made<00:06:59.389> my<00:06:59.599> career<00:06:59.809> right

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:00.139 
in that would have made my career right

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.379 
in that would have made my career right
there<00:07:00.379> I<00:07:00.559> really<00:07:01.339> want<00:07:01.579> to<00:07:01.669> get<00:07:01.849> a<00:07:01.969> header<00:07:02.209> from

a<00:07:02.539> corner<00:07:02.569> I<00:07:03.079> don't<00:07:03.949> know<00:07:04.009> if<00:07:04.099> it'll<00:07:04.219> ever

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:04.339 
a corner I don't know if it'll ever

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.579 
a corner I don't know if it'll ever
happen<00:07:04.490> but<00:07:04.969> i<00:07:05.149> stoled<00:07:05.809> the<00:07:06.050> ball<00:07:06.259> there<00:07:06.469> and

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:06.589

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:07.839 
happen but i stoled the ball there and
usually<00:07:06.709> I<00:07:06.949> tried<00:07:07.189> to<00:07:07.279> rush<00:07:07.459> it<00:07:07.610> after

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
usually I tried to rush it after

usually I tried to rush it after
stealing<00:07:08.089> the<00:07:08.269> ball<00:07:08.419> but<00:07:08.629> then<00:07:08.839> actually<00:07:09.169> took

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
stealing the ball but then actually took

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.869 
stealing the ball but then actually took
my<00:07:09.469> time<00:07:09.679> and<00:07:09.800> got<00:07:10.009> some<00:07:10.189> nice<00:07:10.369> dribbles<00:07:10.789> and

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
my time and got some nice dribbles and

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.819 
my time and got some nice dribbles and
but<00:07:11.300> look<00:07:11.449> at<00:07:11.569> this<00:07:11.659> one<00:07:11.990> over<00:07:12.319> top<00:07:12.619> through

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:12.829 
but look at this one over top through

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:14.619 
but look at this one over top through
ball<00:07:13.039> I<00:07:13.249> was<00:07:13.550> feeling<00:07:13.849> real<00:07:14.029> confident<00:07:14.449> so<00:07:14.599> I

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629 
ball I was feeling real confident so I

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.059 
ball I was feeling real confident so I
tried<00:07:14.929> to<00:07:15.050> chip<00:07:15.259> it<00:07:15.409> I<00:07:15.529> don't<00:07:15.709> think<00:07:15.829> that<00:07:15.860> was

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:16.069 
tried to chip it I don't think that was

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.230 
tried to chip it I don't think that was
going<00:07:16.249> on<00:07:16.339> target<00:07:16.699> but<00:07:16.819> it<00:07:16.939> does<00:07:17.089> get

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
going on target but it does get

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.049 
going on target but it does get
deflected<00:07:17.599> away<00:07:17.809> I<00:07:18.139> am<00:07:18.559> yet<00:07:18.860> to<00:07:18.889> get<00:07:19.459> a<00:07:19.669> chip

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:20.059

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
that's kind of frustrating because I

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.209
