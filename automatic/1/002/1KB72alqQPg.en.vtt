00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.039 
adventure
this<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.390> unconscious<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.930> know<00:01:57.049> your<00:01:57.200> food

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049

it's<00:02:03.049> not<00:02:03.140> really<00:02:03.560> heavy

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:20.420 

why<00:02:08.909> do<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:10.409> he<00:02:10.590> wanted<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:19.430> go
