00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
unfortunately this becomes just a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.079 
unfortunately this becomes just a
tangled<00:00:13.259> mess<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.679> carry<00:00:13.920> around<00:00:14.099> so

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
tangled mess to carry around so

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.930 
tangled mess to carry around so
fortunately<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> solution<00:00:16.800> wow<00:00:17.609> this

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940

sounds<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.330> an<00:00:18.510> infomercial<00:00:19.189> what<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> did

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.549 

which<00:00:57.210> means<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.750> something<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.200> easy

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
which means it's something that's easy

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.270 
which means it's something that's easy
to<00:00:58.770> carry<00:00:59.309> around<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:04.409> sound<00:01:04.710> while<00:01:05.100> not

to carry around and the sound while not
fantastic<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> still<00:01:06.510> decent<00:01:07.550> even<00:01:08.550> when<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
fantastic is still decent even when I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.219 
fantastic is still decent even when I
have<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> cords<00:01:09.300> out<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.810> tucked<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

cords<00:01:12.030> coming<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.660> rather<00:01:13.410> than<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
cords coming out of it rather than a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
cords coming out of it rather than a
whole<00:01:14.310> mess<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.200> speakers<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> tangles<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
whole mess of speakers and tangles and

whole mess of speakers and tangles and
power<00:01:17.310> cables<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> other<00:01:18.450> stuff

power cables and all that other stuff

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:32.840 
power cables and all that other stuff
and<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> doesn't<00:01:20.340> sound<00:01:20.520> half<00:01:20.759> bad<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.700> weird

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and it doesn't sound half bad the weird

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
and it doesn't sound half bad the weird
thing<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> sounds<00:01:33.690> actually<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:34.200> more

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
thing is this sounds actually much more

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
thing is this sounds actually much more
tinny<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.130> nearly<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.550> when<00:01:35.910> it's

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
tinny and not nearly as good when it's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
tinny and not nearly as good when it's
open<00:01:43.430> that's<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.640> project
