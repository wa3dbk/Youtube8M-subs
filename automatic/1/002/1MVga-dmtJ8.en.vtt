 on the street minus 20 degrees index 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:14.219
 relationship a little warmer mixture shows 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:18.990
 when starting in the morning we burn gas so 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.199
 Well, the thermometer put the car to watch 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.070
 how many degrees is still hot

 when about and put on cars 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.669
 what turned on 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.100
 and note the time 312 machine completely 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.970
 cold day stood at less 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.870
 minus 23:19 learned the first speed 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.870
 the car starts to warm up 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840
 we 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 321 include second speed temp 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.500
 in the cabin 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.220
 there is a couple that we have shown -10 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:22.850
 somewhere 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:26.830
 wait further speed 3 happens 323 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.830
 4 speed was treated 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.960
 temperature yet 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.780
 far from 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.130
 90 degrees 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.130
 low heating 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.720
 show also shows -10 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.910
 show 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 the bar still goes 325 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.409
 maximum speed turned on 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.360
 climate 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.820
 temperature yet 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.970
 far from 90 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 blowing from ducts so slightly warm 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.180
 air 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.190
 but the steam is almost gone thermometer 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.769
 shows that the car is already slightly 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.769
 warmer about minus 8 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.310
 the sound turned on the maximum 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.010
 speed that is 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.410
 326 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.069
 winter flax turns the stove 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.390
 temperature is also still 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.260
 the decision is not a super turnover from Odessa already 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.260
 how long 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.190
 328 stove at the maximum 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.790
 the car is still not warmed up but already 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.790
 close 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.130
 bottom hot top 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.709
 hungry but blows out that is on 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.460
 maximum air speed is already such 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.040
 enough 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.220
 warm but not hot no reapers 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.150

 this was driving another picture now 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.140
 check how much temperature does he have 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.100
 he has long been what 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.790
 ok blows from me yet 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.820
 fill in my build antifreeze thermometer 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:41.210
