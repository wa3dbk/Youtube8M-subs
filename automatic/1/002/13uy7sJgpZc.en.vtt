00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.200 
builds heat when the clutch gets hot
it's<00:01:32.380> much<00:01:32.680> like<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:32.979> brakes<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.579> your<00:01:33.609> car<00:01:33.939> in

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
it's much like the brakes on your car in

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.410 
it's much like the brakes on your car in
the<00:01:34.689> mountains<00:01:35.049> where<00:01:35.920> they<00:01:36.579> get<00:01:36.729> mushy<00:01:37.030> and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
the mountains where they get mushy and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.630 
the mountains where they get mushy and
they<00:01:37.780> don't<00:01:37.960> perform<00:01:38.140> well<00:01:38.439> maybe<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.460> get<00:01:39.609> a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
they don't perform well maybe you get a

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.480 
they don't perform well maybe you get a
lot<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:40.119> free<00:01:40.689> play<00:01:40.929> at<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.859> lever<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.280> perch

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
lot of free play at the lever and perch

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.810 
lot of free play at the lever and perch
so<00:01:43.390> by<00:01:43.600> building<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:44.079> clutch<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.700> is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
so by building a clutch that that is

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.149 
so by building a clutch that that is
highly<00:01:46.179> precision<00:01:46.689> it<00:01:46.869> takes<00:01:47.350> off<00:01:47.619> smoother

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
highly precision it takes off smoother

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.120 
highly precision it takes off smoother
and<00:01:48.340> more<00:01:48.759> positively<00:01:49.560> where's<00:01:50.560> your<00:01:50.710> Fanning

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
and more positively where's your Fanning

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.459 
and more positively where's your Fanning
the<00:01:51.219> clutch<00:01:51.429> through<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.850> turns<00:01:52.119> or<00:01:52.749> on<00:01:53.289> this

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
the clutch through the turns or on this

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.569 
the clutch through the turns or on this
are<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:53.950> starting<00:01:54.340> line

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
are on the starting line

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.419 
are on the starting line
it's<00:01:55.179> building<00:01:55.539> less<00:01:55.810> heat<00:01:56.079> and<00:01:56.350> at<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.249> same

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
it's building less heat and at the same

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.669 
it's building less heat and at the same
time<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.479> staying<00:01:58.719> much<00:01:58.990> cooler<00:01:59.289> so<00:01:59.590> it

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
time it is staying much cooler so it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.039 
time it is staying much cooler so it
performs<00:02:00.039> much<00:02:00.369> better<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:01.329> two<00:02:01.390> couple<00:02:01.840> are

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
performs much better so two couple are

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.679 
performs much better so two couple are

biggest<00:02:25.689> problem<00:02:26.049> with<00:02:26.230> clutch<00:02:26.650> Springs

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
biggest problem with clutch Springs

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.339 
biggest problem with clutch Springs
historically<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:27.879> they<00:02:28.810> lose<00:02:29.079> their

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
historically is that they lose their

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.440 
historically is that they lose their
heat<00:02:29.620> through<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.489> heat<00:02:30.790> cycles<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.329> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
heat through the heat cycles of the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.420 
heat through the heat cycles of the
motor<00:02:31.689> because<00:02:31.930> they're<00:02:32.379> typically<00:02:33.099> made

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
motor because they're typically made

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.119 
motor because they're typically made
from<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.730> material<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.590> loses<00:02:35.950> its

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
from a material that just loses its

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.629 
from a material that just loses its
strength<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.780> what<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.139> have<00:02:38.349> done<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:39.219> combat

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
strength so what we have done to combat

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.490 
strength so what we have done to combat
that<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:39.879> to<00:02:40.120> build<00:02:40.420> our<00:02:40.659> Springs<00:02:41.019> out<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.349> a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
that is to build our Springs out of a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.039 
that is to build our Springs out of a
high<00:02:41.650> temp<00:02:41.920> material<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:43.120> resists<00:02:43.689> losing

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
high temp material that resists losing

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.750 
high temp material that resists losing
its<00:02:44.170> strength<00:02:44.469> up<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.859> six<00:02:45.099> hundred<00:02:45.159> and<00:02:45.489> fifty

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
its strength up to six hundred and fifty

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.080 
its strength up to six hundred and fifty
degrees<00:02:46.030> Fahrenheit<00:02:47.010> no<00:02:48.010> clutch<00:02:48.310> would<00:02:48.909> ever

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
degrees Fahrenheit no clutch would ever

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.030 
degrees Fahrenheit no clutch would ever
get<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.599> that<00:02:49.930> amount<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.379> heat<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.859> by

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
get to that amount of heat so by

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.550 
get to that amount of heat so by
building<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.519> spring<00:02:51.879> that<00:02:52.659> is<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.319> right

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
building a spring that is the right

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.929 
building a spring that is the right
amount<00:02:53.889> of<00:02:53.919> clamping<00:02:54.340> pressure<00:02:54.400> for<00:02:54.909> a

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
amount of clamping pressure for a

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.809 
amount of clamping pressure for a
high-performance<00:02:55.180> motor<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.639> building<00:02:57.639> from

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
high-performance motor and building from

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.509 
high-performance motor and building from
a<00:02:57.939> material<00:02:58.449> that<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.290> keeps<00:02:59.739> that<00:03:00.010> clamping

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
a material that that keeps that clamping

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.809 
a material that that keeps that clamping
pressure<00:03:01.139> we<00:03:02.139> can<00:03:02.379> build<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.859> clutch<00:03:03.099> that<00:03:03.370> just

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
pressure we can build a clutch that just

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.229 
pressure we can build a clutch that just
lasts<00:03:04.239> much<00:03:04.510> much<00:03:04.810> longer<00:03:05.230> than<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.439> stock

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
lasts much much longer than the stock

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.599 
lasts much much longer than the stock
then<00:03:07.239> by<00:03:07.599> coupling<00:03:08.079> that<00:03:08.260> with<00:03:08.319> our<00:03:08.829> plates

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
then by coupling that with our plates

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.909 
then by coupling that with our plates
that<00:03:10.449> do<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.319> things<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.889> just

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
that do all the things that I just

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.280 
that do all the things that I just
described<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.969> build<00:03:13.449> less<00:03:13.689> heat<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.139> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
described to build less heat in the

higher<00:03:17.019> performance<00:03:18.000> engages<00:03:19.000> much<00:03:19.239> smoother

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
higher performance engages much smoother

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.599 
higher performance engages much smoother
more<00:03:20.049> positively<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.769> stays<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.549> way

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
more positively and stays that way
