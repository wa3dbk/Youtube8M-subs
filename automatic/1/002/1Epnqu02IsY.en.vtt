wig and to my scalp no one scalp is this
color<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.930> had<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.440> move<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.800> something<00:03:53.130> else

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
color so I had to move to something else

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.960 
color so I had to move to something else
now<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.590> neck<00:03:55.980> cap<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.760> designed

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
now this is a neck cap that is designed

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.870 
now this is a neck cap that is designed
specifically<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.900> wear<00:03:58.200> wigs<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.709> however<00:03:59.370> I

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
specifically to wear wigs with however I

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.560 
specifically to wear wigs with however I
don't<00:04:00.870> think<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.320> provides<00:04:01.709> enough

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
don't think that it provides enough

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.570 
don't think that it provides enough
coverage<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.959> enough<00:04:04.560> protection<00:04:04.800> from<00:04:05.370> my

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
coverage and enough protection from my

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.460 
coverage and enough protection from my
hair<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.480> not<00:04:06.630> exactly<00:04:07.200> what<00:04:07.440> I

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
hair so this is not exactly what I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.580 
hair so this is not exactly what I
wanted<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.040> use<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:09.150> protect<00:04:09.510> my<00:04:09.840> hair<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.470> are

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
it won't be as unbearable especially if

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.770

one<00:04:33.950> thing<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.250> was<00:04:34.400> concerned<00:04:34.760> about<00:04:34.970> when<00:04:35.240> I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
one thing I was concerned about when I

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.390 
one thing I was concerned about when I
took<00:04:35.360> this<00:04:35.660> out<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> bag<00:04:36.290> was<00:04:36.890> this<00:04:37.100> thick

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
took this out of the bag was this thick

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.240 
took this out of the bag was this thick
elastic<00:04:38.000> band<00:04:38.570> around<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.410> I'm<00:04:39.740> assuming

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
elastic band around it and I'm assuming

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.330 
elastic band around it and I'm assuming
it's<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.580> keep<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:41.060> net<00:04:41.240> in<00:04:41.420> place<00:04:41.860> all<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:42.920> did

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
it's to keep the net in place all I did

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.250 
it's to keep the net in place all I did
to<00:04:43.370> get<00:04:43.610> past<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:44.060> is<00:04:44.270> just<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.720> fold<00:04:45.080> it

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
to get past that is just to fold it

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.520 
to get past that is just to fold it
backwards<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:46.150> I've<00:04:47.150> got<00:04:47.660> my<00:04:47.840> protection<00:04:48.200> and

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
backwards and I've got my protection and

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.300 
backwards and I've got my protection and
the<00:04:49.130> great<00:04:49.340> thing<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.550> it's<00:04:49.880> black<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:51.310> it's

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
the great thing is it's black so it's

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.010 
the great thing is it's black so it's
not<00:04:52.520> gonna<00:04:52.640> look<00:04:52.850> too<00:04:53.090> crazy<00:04:53.390> underneath<00:04:53.840> my

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.700 
mindful of is that all wigs come with
combs<00:05:00.980> in<00:05:01.430> them<00:05:01.820> now<00:05:02.510> these<00:05:02.960> combs<00:05:03.350> are
