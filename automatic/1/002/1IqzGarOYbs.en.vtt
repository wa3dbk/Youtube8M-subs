00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:21.000
 welcome, you are cooking step by step 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 and today I'm going to show you how to try 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.759
 and these are the ingredients that I'm going to 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.599
 use how important potatoes are 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.599
 medium or large 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.329
 and you have to peel the cut 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.659
 longitudinally that is to say so at 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.659
 long 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.340
 and then cut them in the middle 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.920
 well and then go back to cutting and it's going to 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.500
 something like this 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.579
 they have to be about 45 slices 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.699
 millimeters thick 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.540
 that is to say half a centimeter of thickness the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.420
 we will put in water about four hours to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.340
 that release all the starch in water 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 cold will give him and then later 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.450
 we drain 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 we get it right it is important that they are 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.369
 dry like that when we put them in the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 oil do not splash with a rag 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.740
 kitchen or with kitchen towels we are going to 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.500
 take them out 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.049
 and you have to fry them for about 15 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 15 to 20 minutes approximately 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.460
 at 120 degrees 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.400
 to get golden and when we see that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.260
 they are so they start to explode 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.260
 the first writing will be ready 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 here I am using electric fryer 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.280
 but if they do not have the same it can be 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.280
 do with two sheets 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 we already took it out of the first oil and the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.500
 we put a second oil that is a lot 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.950
 hottest 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.100
 integrated 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 Be careful not to burn and here they are going to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.550
 start to inflate you have to leave them 30 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.550
 seconds 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.420
 when they are well golden, we take them out 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.000
 we drain 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.000
 and we will have ready the potatoes suffer 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.180
 and I'll put a little garlic and parsley 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.180
 to give a touch of flavor 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.400
 and here I wanted to show you how good they are 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.400
 as inflated the potatoes 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.950
 and they are very rich very tender for 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840
 inside and crispy on the outside that yes there 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.740
 than eating them fast because if you do not 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.740
 they begin to deflate 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.040
 and you know if they like disloyalty dad and 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.880
 subscribe to the channel a greeting and even the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.880
 next recipe
