in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> main<00:01:07.500> review<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> website<00:01:08.040> where

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
in the main review on the website where

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.490 
in the main review on the website where
you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.810> costs<00:01:10.200> about

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
you can get it from and it costs about

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
you can get it from and it costs about
90<00:01:11.100> quid<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.119> cheap<00:01:12.180> thing

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
90 quid I think so it's not cheap thing

itself<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.730> mean<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.300> like<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.720> like

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
itself I mean I really do like it I like

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900 
itself I mean I really do like it I like
small<00:02:30.260> stuff<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.739> like<00:02:31.069> high<00:02:31.250> quality<00:02:31.310> stuff

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
small stuff I like high quality stuff

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.309 
small stuff I like high quality stuff
and<00:02:32.270> it's<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:33.050> both<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:34.220> has<00:02:34.819> two<00:02:35.450> inputs<00:02:35.780> for

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
and it's it's both it has two inputs for

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.660 
and it's it's both it has two inputs for
the<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.269> sound<00:02:38.690> signal<00:02:39.260> from<00:02:39.500> your<00:02:39.709> iPad

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the for the sound signal from your iPad

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.990 
the for the sound signal from your iPad
iPhone<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.690> on<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.550> difference<00:02:43.550> between<00:02:43.610> them

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
iPhone so on the difference between them

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.540 
iPhone so on the difference between them
is<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.120> one<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.630> high<00:02:45.620> gain<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.160> one's<00:02:46.340> low

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
is that one is high gain and one's low

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.400 
is that one is high gain and one's low
game<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.239> one<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.540> better<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:47.989> listening<00:02:48.290> at

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
game so one is better for listening at

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.960 
game so one is better for listening at
low<00:02:48.500> volumes<00:02:48.920> because<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.459> has<00:02:49.640> got<00:02:49.819> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
low volumes because this has got a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.030 
low volumes because this has got a
there's<00:02:50.840> no<00:02:50.930> volume<00:02:51.140> control<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.830> it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
there's no volume control on this it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.440 
there's no volume control on this it
uses<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.400> volume<00:02:52.730> control<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.060> whatever<00:02:53.269> you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
uses a volume control on whatever you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.059 
uses a volume control on whatever you
plug<00:02:53.600> into<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.380> if<00:02:54.500> you're<00:02:54.650> listening<00:02:54.980> at

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
plug into it so if you're listening at

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.559 
plug into it so if you're listening at
low<00:02:55.190> volume<00:02:55.580> when<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.760> plug<00:02:56.000> your<00:02:56.150> phone<00:02:56.209> in

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
low volume when you plug your phone in

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.640 
low volume when you plug your phone in
you're<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.049> want<00:02:57.110> your<00:02:57.230> phone<00:02:57.470> volume

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
you're going to want your phone volume

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.539 
you're going to want your phone volume
somewhere<00:02:58.010> near<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> top

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
somewhere near the top

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.309 
somewhere near the top
you<00:02:58.760> know<00:02:58.880> that's<00:02:59.060> natural<00:02:59.510> isn't<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.080> that

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
you know that's natural isn't it so that

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.020 
you know that's natural isn't it so that
you<00:03:00.470> therefore<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.100> would<00:03:01.220> use<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.700> low<00:03:01.819> gain

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
you therefore you would use the low gain

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.789 
you therefore you would use the low gain
one<00:03:02.239> but<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.810> want<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.590> want<00:03:03.680> to

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
one but if you want it to you want to

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.930 
one but if you want it to you want to
push<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:04.069> is<00:03:04.220> harder<00:03:04.519> at<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> heart<00:03:04.850> as

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
push this is harder at the heart as

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.090 
push this is harder at the heart as
it'll<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:05.180> put<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.959> high<00:03:06.110> gain<00:03:06.170> one<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
it'll go put it in the high gain one it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.949 
it'll go put it in the high gain one it
has<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> limiter<00:03:07.850> built<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.239> now<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.600> means<00:03:08.750> if

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
has a limiter built in now that means if

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.110 
has a limiter built in now that means if
you<00:03:09.080> push<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.410> too<00:03:09.560> hard<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:10.069> will<00:03:10.400> stop<00:03:10.940> it

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
you push it too hard it will stop it

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.180 
you push it too hard it will stop it
either<00:03:11.690> damaging<00:03:12.260> itself<00:03:12.530> or<00:03:12.769> sounding

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
either damaging itself or sounding

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.370 
either damaging itself or sounding
really<00:03:13.340> really<00:03:13.700> bad<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.330> obviously<00:03:14.720> it's

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
really really bad but obviously it's

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.840 
really really bad but obviously it's
always<00:03:15.590> best<00:03:15.799> we<00:03:16.040> know<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.340> as<00:03:16.430> Conejo<00:03:16.790> is

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
always best we know that as Conejo is

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.509 
always best we know that as Conejo is
not<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.150> push<00:03:17.329> things<00:03:17.510> too<00:03:17.750> hard<00:03:17.930> if<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:19.280> plug

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
not to push things too hard if you plug

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.020 
not to push things too hard if you plug
a<00:03:19.760> source<00:03:20.329> into<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:21.260> light<00:03:21.980> will<00:03:22.609> light<00:03:22.790> up

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
a source into it a light will light up

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.960 
a source into it a light will light up
and<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.540> cycles<00:03:24.079> through<00:03:24.370> various<00:03:25.370> colors<00:03:25.760> to
