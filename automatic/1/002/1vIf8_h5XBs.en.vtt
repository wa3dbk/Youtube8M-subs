all right dudes finally got some parts

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:13.700 
all right dudes finally got some parts
in<00:00:03.210> for<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.510> TW<00:00:04.700> so<00:00:08.179> ready<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:12.259> do<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.440> alive

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
in for the TW so ready to do it alive

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:22.210 
in for the TW so ready to do it alive
cylinder<00:00:14.340> home<00:00:15.230> already<00:00:16.230> measured<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.359> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.960 

very<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:24.000> minimal<00:00:24.510> we're<00:00:24.810> less<00:00:25.769> than<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.099> half

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
very very minimal we're less than a half

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.370 
very very minimal we're less than a half
a<00:00:27.000> thousand<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.900> little<00:00:28.080> wiggle

hint you know it because I don't really
want<00:00:35.610> removing<00:00:36.329> men<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.520> just<00:00:38.520> want<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.950> put<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
want removing men I just want to put a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.139 
want removing men I just want to put a
light<00:00:41.579> scoring<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:44.149> really

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
light scoring in there just like really

00:00:45.149 --> 00:01:01.040 
light scoring in there just like really
like<00:00:45.390> cross<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.110> chest<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:59.510> see<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
like cross that chest I see what kind of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.369 
like cross that chest I see what kind of
a<00:01:01.170> piston<00:01:01.590> ring<00:01:01.800> gap<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.110> know<00:01:04.110> some

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
a piston ring gap with that I know some

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.910 
a piston ring gap with that I know some
guys<00:01:04.589> would<00:01:04.619> use<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> rigid<00:01:05.640> home<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.229> if

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
guys would use a rigid home and I do if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.789 
guys would use a rigid home and I do if
I'm<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.330> metal<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.680> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I'm gonna take any metal out you know if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.859 
I'm gonna take any metal out you know if
I<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> eat<00:01:11.369> three<00:01:11.640> or<00:01:11.670> four<00:01:11.760> thousandths<00:01:12.479> over

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
I can eat three or four thousandths over

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:42.330 
I can eat three or four thousandths over
or<00:01:13.110> something<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:14.540> yeah

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.590 

doing<00:01:43.340> anything<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.940> there

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:06.289 

Oh

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.420 

and<00:02:06.840> we'll<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> next<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:10.430> Google

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and we'll do this next one Google

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.550 
and we'll do this next one Google
kitchen<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.629> lubricant<00:02:16.170> that's<00:02:16.230> on

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
kitchen and just the lubricant that's on

00:02:16.560 --> 00:03:42.680 
kitchen and just the lubricant that's on
the<00:02:16.739> home<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:21.569> too<00:02:21.780> much

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.580 

okay<00:03:43.690> not<00:03:44.680> any<00:03:44.890> depth<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.520> that<00:03:45.730> but<00:03:46.590> but

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
okay not any depth to that but but

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.430 
okay not any depth to that but but
pretty<00:03:47.830> good<00:03:48.660> deglazing<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.930> nice<00:03:50.260> little

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
pretty good deglazing and a nice little

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.140 
pretty good deglazing and a nice little
crosshatch<00:03:50.920> pattern<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.520> I'm<00:03:51.640> thinking<00:03:52.000> that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
crosshatch pattern so I'm thinking that

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:01.470 
crosshatch pattern so I'm thinking that
the<00:03:52.300> Rings<00:03:53.170> will<00:03:53.440> sleet<00:03:53.680> okay<00:03:59.970> well<00:04:00.970> we've<00:04:01.270> got

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the Rings will sleet okay well we've got

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.650 
the Rings will sleet okay well we've got
the<00:04:01.720> piston<00:04:02.620> ring<00:04:02.830> in<00:04:02.950> there<00:04:03.130> last<00:04:03.400> one<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
the piston ring in there last one the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.390 
the piston ring in there last one the
long<00:04:04.780> rings<00:04:05.080> three-piece<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:05.830> can<00:04:06.100> check

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
long rings three-piece so you can check

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.850 
long rings three-piece so you can check
it<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.840> gap<00:04:08.110> is<00:04:08.140> at<00:04:10.260> fifteen<00:04:11.260> thousand

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
it and the gap is at fifteen thousand

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.300 
it and the gap is at fifteen thousand
switch<00:04:12.070> will<00:04:12.310> work<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:14.230> other<00:04:14.410> ring<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.070> that

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
switch will work the other ring is that

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.710 
switch will work the other ring is that
fifteen<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.570> good<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.560> go<00:04:17.709> there<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:22.570> was

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
fifteen so good to go there and it was

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.560 
fifteen so good to go there and it was
like<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:23.020> said<00:04:23.290> honed<00:04:23.920> it<00:04:24.130> really<00:04:24.400> light<00:04:24.790> just

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
like I said honed it really light just

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.510 
like I said honed it really light just
to<00:04:25.720> put<00:04:26.170> a<00:04:26.200> cross<00:04:26.410> hatch<00:04:26.650> pattern<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.370> help

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
to put a cross hatch pattern is to help

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.870 
to put a cross hatch pattern is to help
the<00:04:27.640> Rings<00:04:27.850> break-in<00:04:28.450> get<00:04:28.750> rid<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> glaze

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
the Rings break-in get rid of the glaze

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.880 
the Rings break-in get rid of the glaze
because<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.810> cutting<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.620> getting<00:04:32.770> a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
because that cutting that and getting a

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.020 
because that cutting that and getting a
really<00:04:33.190> deep<00:04:33.460> dark<00:04:34.180> shiny<00:04:36.030> crosshatch

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
really deep dark shiny crosshatch

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.850 
really deep dark shiny crosshatch
pattern<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.600> my<00:04:37.750> mind<00:04:37.990> that's<00:04:38.260> just<00:04:38.500> taking<00:04:38.800> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
pattern in my mind that's just taking a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.760 
pattern in my mind that's just taking a
few<00:04:39.010> thousandths<00:04:39.550> away<00:04:39.760> from<00:04:39.970> your<00:04:40.150> cylinder

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
few thousandths away from your cylinder

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.330 
few thousandths away from your cylinder
so<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:42.810> guess<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.020> next<00:04:44.050> part<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:44.800> to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
so I guess the next part of this is to

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.730 
so I guess the next part of this is to
get<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.390> rings<00:04:46.630> on<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> piston<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.500> get

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
get the rings on the piston and get

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.670 
get the rings on the piston and get
ready<00:04:47.950> to<00:04:48.070> put<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.600> cylinder<00:04:49.600> back<00:04:49.900> on<00:04:52.680> well

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
ready to put the cylinder back on well

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.120 
ready to put the cylinder back on well
tubers<00:04:54.480> got<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:57.419> piston<00:04:58.419> back<00:04:58.630> on<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.320> slid

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
tubers got the piston back on and slid

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.400 
tubers got the piston back on and slid
the<00:05:00.250> cylinder<00:05:00.669> down<00:05:00.820> on<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.330> rather<00:05:02.230> than

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
the cylinder down on it and rather than

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.730 
the cylinder down on it and rather than
bore<00:05:02.740> everybody<00:05:03.220> with<00:05:04.440> grassland<00:05:05.440> with<00:05:05.530> that

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
bore everybody with grassland with that

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.190 
bore everybody with grassland with that
for<00:05:06.010> no<00:05:06.130> telling<00:05:06.490> how<00:05:06.760> many<00:05:06.820> minutes<00:05:07.390> getting

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
for no telling how many minutes getting

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.930 
for no telling how many minutes getting
the<00:05:08.290> piston<00:05:08.650> rings<00:05:08.919> back<00:05:09.190> up<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.580> there<00:05:09.730> and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
the piston rings back up in there and

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.450 
the piston rings back up in there and
all<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.830> want<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.070> add<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.280> put<00:05:12.370> it

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
all that I just want to add and put it

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.940 
all that I just want to add and put it

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
together the only thing I guess that's

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.730 
together the only thing I guess that's
that<00:05:18.730> I<00:05:18.760> think<00:05:19.120> significant<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:21.210> did<00:05:22.210> use
