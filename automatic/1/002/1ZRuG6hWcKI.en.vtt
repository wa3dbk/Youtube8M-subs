first two she's done and very roughly
drawn<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:16.080> would<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> 50/50<00:02:17.100> split<00:02:17.790> on

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
drawn out this would be a 50/50 split on

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.140 
drawn out this would be a 50/50 split on
the<00:02:18.120> backend<00:02:18.300> profits<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.730> if<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.880> don't<00:02:21.030> want

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the backend profits and if I don't want

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
the backend profits and if I don't want
to<00:02:21.209> make<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.480> very<00:02:21.660> profitable<00:02:22.019> venture

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
for both of us but it might take a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.600 
for both of us but it might take a
little<00:02:24.239> time<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.019> who<00:02:25.470> knows<00:02:25.650> I'm<00:02:26.010> not
