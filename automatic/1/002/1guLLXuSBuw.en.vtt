 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.290
 I bring you a game of conquest in 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.780
 caspian border let's try 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.549
 conquer the caspian to the love of tea 90 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.770
 from the Russian faction on the side of the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.560
 Russians and attentive because nothing else start 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.689
 the game behind in the middle of tanks 20 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.550
 hours tanks finally give me was 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.109
 one of the very few medals that I 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.269
 remain I think I have this or I 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.279
 it was this better said and the one of arms 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.680
 fixed and I do not know what other shit of these 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.690
 who have neither feet nor heads in 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.160
 medals so well this was the only one 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.469
 what was missing that really made me 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.760
 illusion get so the got 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.200
 you're going to start the game was the 2 that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 It was a protein plan and nothing was done 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.789
 that errands and doing and point 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.090
 host the bitch medal as a bitch 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.309
 mother 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.899
 I cut the game because here where 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.289
 I'm right now what I'm seeing 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.579
 here coming out from the alpha base that by 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.989
 true I 'm looking at myself and they 're not 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.480
 removing as we left we go 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.820
 cloth 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.040
 we had four captured flags and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.979
 we had not killed anyone be a 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.530
 peaceful enough conquest is not known 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.210
 some conquest in austria the modern 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.680
 we go around we are capturing in the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 rock and it is rotating and well, it was going 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360
 giving the circumstance that it does not 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 we were growing the flags therefore 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 well there was not much host this is going to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.410
 take a cannon shot in the mouth good of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.680
 shrapnel really takes now what 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.080
 trunk of the mines antitank mines 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 francs with the thermal vision thing that 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 I never take it off because it is that the rest 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.300
 of skills next to vision 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.220
 wall thermal beings of whores laughs 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.590
 with thermal revision I'm not going to eat 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.509
 a fucking anti-tank mine in life be 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 and the rock is that puts you three mines 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.340
 antitank 20 you do not eat them they put you 6 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.530
 20 antitank mines do not eat them 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.149
 they put 9 anti-tank mines 20 do not you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.490
 Eat trunk stop putting mines 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.200
 antitank trunk seriously if the only 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.660
 what it does is putting anti-tank mines is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.630
 give me points because every two mines that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.009
 break you get 240 points and now 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.009
 listen to listen here the outrage 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.840
 is the subscriber alex that should go in the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.720
 jeep with the trunk I am a trunk tank 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.930
 I'll turn away yours to tread the skull 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.240
 nothing will happen to me 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.610
 we were heading to conquer charlie but 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.440
 pussy looks two whores mines on the floor 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.990
 but you think that not the worst is that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 do not fuck me, you look at malvinas but you 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.840
 you think I 'm going to eat some mine 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.660
 serious punishment 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.920
 What are you telling me, uncle, stop 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.540
 put on mudas is that it's something come on I think 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.910
 I do not have any low combinations 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.050
 because I know it's absurd to put the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.910
 mines 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.580
 it is absurd good this is the moment in 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.230
 the one that has the most action in the whole game 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.720
 I believe is that by removing this moment 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.450
 because there is no action in the whole game 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.980
 the two tanks burst and little else does not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 there's a lot more in this good game I think 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.240
 that is for today a rachita a rachita 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.550
 if I remember correctly the level is that 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.890
 I can link the thousand points 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.930
 It was not spectacular either and here 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.820
 we are again in charlie's fuck is 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.990
 that we have not just left here and now 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.790
 we are here again I am removing 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.350
 all the conquests in which no 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 we killed 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.180
 because it's getting there you park as 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.910
 you have the proximity sensor and you have 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.590
 the reactive armor I had put the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.320
 reactive armor and although the dark the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.740
 proximity sensor and we both give 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.260
 the same advantage as ostias 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.700
 is that you get parking and nothing and you put on 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.530
 to look at the radar that someone appears 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.060
 then you go around the canyon you put him 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.210
 an onion with the chest and see you later 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.240
 subscribe can not be very easy and 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.070
 stingy I do not know was not a challenge to say 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.960
 host that are bursting us because 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.820
 in this case we are losing in these 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.980
 moments but they said if it gives me 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.930
 the same go losing was already absolutely 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.360
 same yes yes I know we are going to capture 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.120
 more things than me and here in fact already 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.320
 we go ahead here he told me 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 they said he cured them on the right by 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.470
 the divorce right another 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.810
 here look at those two mines are allied 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.610
 I'm going to break them because even though they're 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.820
 allies and give us an onionzo or we 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.710
 they hit a cannon or they give us a rpg 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.690
 although the mines are allied it would 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.910
 sympathy the explosives would be 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.490
 sympathies of both a rpg and a 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.520
 pipe makes a tank 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.080
 sympathy with the mines 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.270
 they would explode and catch us under us 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.100
 they could do a lot of damage 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.780
 even if they are allied mines like you are going to 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.400
 park there is man one thing is that you go 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.010
 to go over some allied mines 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.750
 it is not a danger, let's say 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.370
 Host are a danger because it can 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.110
 pass something but it is not something that says they are 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.150
 I have to be alert I have to 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.620
 be very aware of it but in 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.030
 change if you are going to park on top of 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.840
 them as in the case that we're going to 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.430
 park to conquer the base then yes that 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560
 It is convenient to break it because it is that 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.230
 We were going to leave in the ass and down or 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.520
 the worst place that has a tank already 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.140
 tends to that this the tank 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.630
 he does not know we're here I say 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.520
 load day to the boss the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.990
 tank that is looking and this but to 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.400
 where society comes to me and I know 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.920
 he found it seems that you have already found out 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.120
 I think it's going to be very late friend 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.300
 my see you in hell and attentive 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.290
 because we see that a lot with that piece 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.420
 white on the floor I thought it was a 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.100
 piece of tank but I got pissed 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.080
 very much shot and it was indeed 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.030
 another bitch mine and here is the most streak 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.670
 long of the game thousand linked points 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.250
 with a conquest that is 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.990
 they really are not are not 100 points the 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.540
 beads are 1000 natural points are not 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.810
 1000 points of actions but of led 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.550
 200 850 of a catch so either 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.770
 there's nothing in this game that you say had 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.060
 that good we just had a lot of fun 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.190
 well I had a great time 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.630
 personally and well then we die 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.960
 that a good game what the fuck I do that 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.190
 I died by the way I do not spare I'm a cannon 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.090
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.090
 next chau chau
