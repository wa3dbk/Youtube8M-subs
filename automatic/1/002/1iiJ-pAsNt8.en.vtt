00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.230

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.659
 we are going to take 8 more than anything because it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 the tupper ends and we can not go back to 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.579
 eat until we buy food and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.030
 obviously the economy is not is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.030
 for it 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.780
 improving the organ a bit that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.780
 less organized 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.330
 but 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.330
 with one we go a little difficult 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.150
 but if impressed 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 who tomorrow you will again eat prophets 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.950
 do not hesitate 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950
 Y 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.120
 there is one thing that comes very well that is 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 the water with beautiful rich rich 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.960
 do not do it, it also costs 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.690
 pasta 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.060
 and with beck or with our friend we are going to 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:42.270
 to be able to cook our croquettes very very 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.689
 very good this microwave 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.040
 bojan of powerful the door 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.540
 now it's out to behave 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.370
 a little bit but we do not have the croquettes 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.390
 with a lot of love with the same one that we 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 have done with mothers and we put then if 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.680
 you like that it's a lot of warm love 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.260
 then propose to five minutes if not 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.250
 you want so much you like it a little cooler 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.250
 two and a half 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.210
 you wait for them to turn since it turns well 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.960
 the stature tomÃ¡s 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.400
 they are very classic croquettes there are people who 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.010
 he wants to split them because he says that if he 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 they make inside we're going to try but I 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.020
 I think it 's an urban legend that 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.020
 let's do 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 la la la la la la la la la 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.450
 tour tour 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.450
 and I think it's rotated 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.800
 shopping 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.800
 perfect 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:53.620
 and the sound like it looks like creep 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:59.170
 t the agro that is rich rich rich 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.319
 and this is the best thing for the sims or the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.090
 best series in history 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.090
 to see the only ones
