 I can trust you

 what will happen to us 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.239
 I gave you my word that I will come back for you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.230

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.790
 how little 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.430

 just the thought of betraying the left 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.190
 glass is for new yorker position 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.579
 courage more heart not to appease 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.550
 your family 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.550
 thy peace deal with 5L 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.990
 time is running out 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.990
