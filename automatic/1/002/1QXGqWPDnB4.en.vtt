00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:09.600
 Yes. 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:12.780
 I would like to introduce some new shadows that fall in autumn. 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.450
 I need something to shadow 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:23.310
 I usually do not do it often . I buy one or two for every season . 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.210
 After replacing this now, it's still a bit more than usual. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 I'm on your side. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:33.719
 Once you see it here, it's a Stila. It 's a Stila shop. 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.350
 There is a fact in there and it is easy to be a non-member, but Stila is very cheap 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.129
 I'll see if it's brand-name air. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:47.489
 This is the two facts of this year and three facts 1 3 5 2 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:51.059
 The reason I bought this is because the first one sees this and it is very leaking in color. 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.749
 It 's a color that Asians can use very often. 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.989
 And this is not always the matte waist always like this color is the fifth place 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:04.920
 I think I wanted to . 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:46.770
 Somewhat warm nose with a little bit of feeling So let 's just say this

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:38.520
 It shines brightly when straightened 4 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.510
 Gold Pearl is not the low blocks of turquoise pearl boyija then this is a test 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.200
 I'll try. 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.020
 This inde some wines that brown color 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.960
 I do not have a good test. 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.960
 Gold Pearl is looking at Four shiny lead 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:02.000
 It's a little like this. It's a little violet . Give me a little lavender . 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:08.540
 I have a hard 4 Pearl So now I do not know where Jin is good in color nails 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.049
 This is the way it is, and then this is the same 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.049
 One more set of urine clara opens in r 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.310
 So this whole thing is money sprinkle seureopjiman great burden liner 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.939
 If you make a point like this in a line like this , very beautiful color 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.240
 I will. 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:30.640
 This agrace is beautiful, too. 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.270
 Perl has a night 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.290
 But at night, this collar will have a little bit of a theme. 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.620
 It really slows down and it's really mats. 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.790
 It looks great. 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:50.260
 But because of this matte collar , the blending is very good 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.540
 I have to give it to you. So there are some disadvantages , but the colors are so perfect for your skin. 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.590
 It feels close. 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.590
 It will be like this 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:09.180
 So do all the shades diverge a bit up in the relatively low amount of soft prices double 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.500
 I do not have a lot of felts that contain branches . 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 I bought it. 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:22.079
 And then this is a bracelet, and I know this for a long time. 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:27.090
 If you look at it here, you can use it this way or so, so this is a bit 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:32.130
 It is a product with a pearl that has a slight yellow tone. 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:37.380
 Pond'm pretty please do so by the company with this blending 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.669
 Now this is the next few Ugg way up to the European Ah Gray Purple 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.440
 Would you say 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:46.470
 It's a gray purple, it's not just a picture, it's a puff 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.529
 So Buff and Shade are all so different in light. 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.219
 Besides, if you do this in points like this , 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.449
 It can be strong against naturalness, so it is a tone that goes well with autumn. 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.689
 I bought it. 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.360
 Ah 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:06.429
 Well this is as completely and then falls 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.119
 Uh earlier it mixed with wine, and even view the Agency's look over some different 

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:12.560
 There is a red purple, but now an easy encounter is almost a little watery. 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:17.030
 Give it to me . 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:21.380
 This was a bout of Natural History and malyijyo This is acceptable or 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:25.220
 Matt, you can play this, you gotta do this, you write it like this. 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.560
 Really all I can do a variety of combinations, I'll show the Gonzo Now 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.630
 It's a game with different colors. 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.740
 This way, I get this kind of color. 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.870
 It's possible. 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:43.129
 For having fortified the then so is 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:46.969
 Iong is quite naturally blended so I always point to two colors 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:49.740
 You can do it in three steps and two columns. 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:54.720
 By base 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:57.690

 When using color, but sometimes one or two well-written so quickly Tropez Description 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.550
 If you do not like it , you can sell it, but at least three times as many colors 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:09.940
 Because of writing 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.940
 I think it's affordable for a price.
