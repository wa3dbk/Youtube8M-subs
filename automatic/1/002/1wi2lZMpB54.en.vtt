00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.219
 how the human brain works that differentiates us from other people are some 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.420
 of the questions we could find an answer to in this magnificent 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.329
 sample 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.140
 the neuron the ages of the brain 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.919
 in it the evolution of the human brain was presented 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.799
 an evolution of 600 million years that goes from the fundamental cell of the 

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.489
 nervous system I miss until the appearance of a specialized organ 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.959
 able to play increasingly complex functions the brain 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.950
 all living beings that have a nervous system use the same 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.560
 neurons cells 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.850
 by voltage changes as help 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 of a substance called slim 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.720
 the neurons of the 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.760
 species looks a lot like each other 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 what differs is the evolutionary level of your nervous system 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.010
 To complete this first section we show some of the properties of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.650
 neurons the speed of response to external stimuli 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.950
 the neuron interaction that is set to make a decision and the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.330
 plasticity that facilitates the creation of new connections between cells what 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 gives rise to learning 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.009
 I see a series of interactive modules 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:30.870
 the visitor 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.860
 You can observe the different properties of the nervous system 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 although some animal species 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.250
 like jellyfish and politicians 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.890
 I do not know simpler than they have authentic 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 black in which they are distributed diffusely throughout his body 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.290
 allow to capture light 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690
 tactile sensations 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 and maintain the ietu 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.850
 A leap forward in this evolution is the appearance of the senses that serve 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.140
 to living beings to examine interact with their environment 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.370
 however these entities have to be endowed with conscience because if not 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.840
 it is very easy to alter your reality 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.570
 this is the case of insects 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.490
 they are able to see with the unfair and touch but they can marry them 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.619
 ease using their claims 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.309
 a chemical substance that allows individuals of the same species to 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.749
 recognize
