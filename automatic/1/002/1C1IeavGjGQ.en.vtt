at<00:00:34.530> Arizona<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.390> six<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> half

at Arizona which is at six and a half

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
seven and a half and I I think when it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.490 
seven and a half and I I think when it
comes<00:00:46.649> down<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> they're<00:00:47.790> a<00:00:47.820> team<00:00:48.500> that

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
comes down to it they're a team that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.190 
comes down to it they're a team that
people<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.980> looked<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.430> year<00:00:51.059> after<00:00:51.360> year<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
people have looked at year after year to

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.650 
people have looked at year after year to
break<00:00:52.950> through<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.879> many<00:00:54.090> chances<00:00:54.329> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
break through well how many chances do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
break through well how many chances do
you<00:00:54.719> want<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> give<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.200> team<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.800> last<00:00:56.039> year

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you want to give a team really last year

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.619 
you want to give a team really last year
i<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> division<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> platter

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
i think the division was on a platter

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.260 
i think the division was on a platter
form<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.320> couldn't<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> done<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.730> me<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
form they couldn't get it done to me is

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
form they couldn't get it done to me is
probably<00:01:00.539> time<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> look<00:01:01.379> somewhere<00:01:01.920> else<00:01:01.980> if

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
probably time to look somewhere else if

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
probably time to look somewhere else if
you're<00:01:02.610> someone<00:01:02.940> looking<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.449> bet<00:01:03.870> overs<00:01:04.229> here

you're someone looking to bet overs here
now<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.519> hand<00:01:05.639> to<00:01:05.969> Adam<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.600> can

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
now on the other hand to Adam you can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.569 
now on the other hand to Adam you can
bet<00:01:06.959> unders<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.679> that's<00:01:07.889> something<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
bet unders so that's something also to

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.160 
bet unders so that's something also to
look<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.969> you<00:01:09.060> don't<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> team<00:01:09.749> chicken

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
look at if you don't like a team chicken

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
look at if you don't like a team chicken
so<00:01:10.529> given<00:01:10.889> all<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.219> low<00:01:11.549> numbers<00:01:11.579> overall

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
so given all these low numbers overall

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.419 
so given all these low numbers overall
for<00:01:12.569> an<00:01:12.659> entire<00:01:12.899> division<00:01:13.109> is<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.950> any<00:01:14.130> bet

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
for an entire division is there any bet

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:15.949 
for an entire division is there any bet
either<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.969> that<00:01:15.179> you<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.630> any<00:01:15.779> of<00:01:15.899> these

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
either way that you like on any of these

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.279 
either way that you like on any of these
teams<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.399> under<00:01:17.789> on<00:01:17.969> San<00:01:18.659> Francisco

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
teams I like the under on San Francisco

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.249 
teams I like the under on San Francisco
I<00:01:19.499> just<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.279> don't<00:01:20.399> think<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:21.719> going<00:01:21.959> to<00:01:22.079> be

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
I just I don't think they're going to be

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.529 
I just I don't think they're going to be
a<00:01:22.289> team<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.829> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.279> all<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.240> good

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
a team that's going to be all that good

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.080 
a team that's going to be all that good
the<00:01:24.779> rebuilding<00:01:25.349> new<00:01:25.649> head<00:01:25.859> coach<00:01:25.889> I<00:01:26.579> think

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the rebuilding new head coach I think

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
the rebuilding new head coach I think
that<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.389> too<00:01:27.899> much<00:01:28.109> uncertainty<00:01:28.709> to<00:01:28.889> take

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that that's too much uncertainty to take

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.279 
that that's too much uncertainty to take
at<00:01:29.459> seven<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:29.969> a<00:01:30.029> half<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.020> this

me<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.109> the<00:01:37.469> other<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:37.679> I<00:01:38.039> have<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.279> mention

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
me and the other thing I have to mention

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.909 
me and the other thing I have to mention
that<00:01:38.700> Arizona's<00:01:39.329> again<00:01:39.630> away<00:01:40.079> Kevin<00:01:40.289> Cobb<00:01:40.649> has

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:40.919 
that Arizona's again away Kevin Cobb has

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.099 
that Arizona's again away Kevin Cobb has
played<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.279> this<00:01:41.399> point<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.539> way<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> think

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
played at this point and the way I think

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.620 
played at this point and the way I think
they<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.649> play<00:01:43.889> defensively<00:01:44.639> those<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.450> all

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
they can play defensively those are all

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.239 
they can play defensively those are all
intriguing<00:01:46.169> numbers<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.889> I<00:01:47.009> had<00:01:47.099> to<00:01:47.219> pick

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
intriguing numbers but if I had to pick

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.389 
intriguing numbers but if I had to pick
one<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.880> probably<00:01:48.689> would<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.439> seattle<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.130> all

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
one I probably would go seattle of all

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.459 
one I probably would go seattle of all
teach<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.939> i<00:01:51.179> really<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.719> they<00:01:52.319> get

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
teach because i really think they get

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.499 
teach because i really think they get
the<00:01:52.619> most<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:53.069> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> talent<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.819> I<00:01:54.149> think

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the most out of the talent and I think

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.419 
the most out of the talent and I think
when<00:01:54.929> it<00:01:55.020> comes<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.709> it's<00:01:55.919> a<00:01:56.009> division

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
when it comes down to it it's a division

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.760 
when it comes down to it it's a division
where<00:01:56.609> I<00:01:56.819> don't<00:01:57.209> like<00:01:57.389> San<00:01:57.659> Francisco<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.529> not

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
where I don't like San Francisco I'm not

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.069 
where I don't like San Francisco I'm not
completely<00:01:59.159> sold<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.939> other<00:02:00.059> teams<00:02:00.419> so<00:02:00.809> at

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
completely sold on the other teams so at

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.049 
completely sold on the other teams so at
6i<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.829> Seattle<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.429> good<00:02:02.579> bargain<00:02:02.789> I

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:03.059 
6i think Seattle is a good bargain I

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:04.909 
6i think Seattle is a good bargain I
think<00:02:03.479> it'll<00:02:03.929> be<00:02:03.959> similar<00:02:04.349> to<00:02:04.380> last<00:02:04.619> year

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:04.919 
think it'll be similar to last year

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:06.559 
think it'll be similar to last year
