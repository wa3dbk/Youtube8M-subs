faction in this sector of space first
things<00:00:28.710> first<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:29.340> able<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.730> plant<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.510> flag<00:00:30.810> in

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
things first I'm able to plant a flag in

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.160 
things first I'm able to plant a flag in
an<00:00:31.529> unoccupied<00:00:32.120> adjacent<00:00:33.120> flag<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
an unoccupied adjacent flag to where I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.360 
an unoccupied adjacent flag to where I
already<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.160> looks<00:00:35.309> like

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
already have one so it looks like

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.590 
already have one so it looks like
there's<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.270> Vilonia<00:00:36.840> meeeeee<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
there's one there on Vilonia meeeeee I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
there's one there on Vilonia meeeeee I
can't<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.559> moon<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.040> finet<00:00:41.399> there

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
can't do it on the moon of finet there

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.950 
can't do it on the moon of finet there
because<00:00:42.030> everything<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.899> hundred

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
because everything is one hundred

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
because everything is one hundred
percent<00:00:43.140> occupied<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> two

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
percent occupied and here I have two

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.920 
percent occupied and here I have two
choices<00:00:45.480> i'm<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> go<00:00:46.260> beside<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.930> just

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
choices i'm going to go beside that just

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.029 
choices i'm going to go beside that just
because<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> few<00:00:52.590> choices<00:00:52.829> uh

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
because and here i got a few choices uh

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
because and here i got a few choices uh
I<00:00:53.489> can't<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> hive<00:00:54.480> city<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.020> i'll<00:00:55.199> just

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I can't do the hive city so i'll just

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.910 
I can't do the hive city so i'll just
i'll<00:00:56.390> go<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.600> keep<00:00:58.109> those<00:00:58.230> bugs<00:00:58.500> away<00:00:58.649> from

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
i'll go here keep those bugs away from

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.720 
i'll go here keep those bugs away from
me<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:01.590> i'm<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> roll<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.190> dice<00:01:02.399> for

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
me now i'm going to roll some dice for

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
me now i'm going to roll some dice for
every<00:01:03.000> warp<00:01:03.300> convergence<00:01:03.960> world<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> on

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
every warp convergence world and on

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.240 
every warp convergence world and on
sixes<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> place<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> flag<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.159> an

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
sixes I get to place a flag in an

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
sixes I get to place a flag in an
unoccupied<00:01:08.640> space<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> hundred

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
unoccupied space if it's a hundred

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
unoccupied space if it's a hundred
percent<00:01:10.290> occupied<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.820> roll<00:01:12.000> three

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
percent occupied then if I roll three

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.760 
percent occupied then if I roll three
sixes<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.020> take<00:01:13.380> over

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
sixes I can actually take over

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
sixes I can actually take over
somebody's<00:01:14.310> IE<00:01:14.850> necrons<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> case

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
somebody's IE necrons in this case

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.370 
somebody's IE necrons in this case
that's<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:17.930> let's<00:01:18.930> roll<00:01:19.110> hopes

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that's what I would do let's roll hopes

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.640 
that's what I would do let's roll hopes
for<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:19.710> six<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.220> three<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.729> case<00:01:20.909> just

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
for some six is three in this case just

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
for some six is three in this case just
one<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.460> anything<00:01:23.640> on

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
one so I don't get to do anything on

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
one so I don't get to do anything on
this<00:01:24.150> planet<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.710> anything<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
this planet I don't have anything on

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.830 
this planet I don't have anything on
this<00:01:26.520> planet<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.360> can't<00:01:27.750> do

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this planet at all so I can't do

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
this planet at all so I can't do
anything<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.259> looks<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.400> i<00:01:29.520> occupy<00:01:30.030> four

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
anything there looks like i occupy four

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.200 
anything there looks like i occupy four
so<00:01:30.509> i'll<00:01:30.600> roll<00:01:30.780> four<00:01:31.079> dice<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.579> some<00:01:32.790> sixes

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so i'll roll four dice so for some sixes

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.830 
so i'll roll four dice so for some sixes
and<00:01:33.659> i<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.079> nothing<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.150> exia<00:01:36.150> finally<00:01:36.659> i

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and i get nothing and exia finally i

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.330 
and i get nothing and exia finally i
have<00:01:36.960> 3<00:01:37.229> i'm<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> roll<00:01:37.650> three<00:01:37.829> dice

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.109 

nothing<00:01:42.380> now<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.619> finet<00:01:44.009> i'm<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> if

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
nothing now on finet i'm going to see if

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.620 
nothing now on finet i'm going to see if
i<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.540> nullify<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.990> warp<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> say

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
i can nullify the warp and when I say

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.170 
i can nullify the warp and when I say
nullify<00:01:49.170> work<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.829> mean<00:01:50.250> disable<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
nullify work I actually mean disable the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.780 
nullify work I actually mean disable the
null<00:01:51.420> field<00:01:51.659> generator<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:52.920> nullifies<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
null field generator which nullifies the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.230 
null field generator which nullifies the
warp<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> roll<00:01:56.159> three<00:01:56.369> dice<00:01:56.399> for

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
warp so I'm going to roll three dice for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.770 
warp so I'm going to roll three dice for
one<00:01:57.930> per<00:01:58.200> tile<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.399> get<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.969> sixes<00:02:00.479> here

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
one per tile and if I get two sixes here

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.149 
one per tile and if I get two sixes here
I'm<00:02:01.100> successful

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.359 

no<00:02:06.159> I'm<00:02:06.340> not<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.470> spaceport<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.220> I

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
no I'm not now this is a spaceport and I

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.340 
no I'm not now this is a spaceport and I
occupy<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.300> for<00:02:10.539> every<00:02:10.720> planet<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.200> has

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
occupy one so for every planet that has

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.840 
occupy one so for every planet that has
a<00:02:11.380> space<00:02:11.709> for<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.100> able<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.400> take<00:02:12.610> out<00:02:12.819> a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
a space for it I'm able to take out a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.420 
a space for it I'm able to take out a
flag<00:02:13.240> here<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.720> plunk<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.140> anywhere<00:02:14.770> i<00:02:14.800> wish

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
flag here and plunk it anywhere i wish

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.240 
flag here and plunk it anywhere i wish
