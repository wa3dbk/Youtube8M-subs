00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.080
 hello friends of uncomplicated ready to leave 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.810
 to start 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.060
 but let's say a front of biology 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 because after all biology can 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.199
 be subdivided into several parts 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.689
 biology chemistry 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.589
 genetic ecology and today we begin 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.580
 with one of which is animal histology 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:41.790
 Let's go by parts and histology is the study 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.650
 of woven fabrics and if I say I am 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.900
 today animal is because here we go 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.000
 which are the main tissues 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.799
 which are present in animals 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.610
 I hope everyone here already knows what 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:57.390
 is a fabric the fabric here is not cotton 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.549
 Linen viscose none of the fabric here 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.640
 a set of cells that normally 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:05.280
 have the same embryonic origin and that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.290
 They are organized so as to perform a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 same function the function to play 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.299
 similar functions 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.700
 then the animal tissues they are in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.970
 a level of organization above the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 cell is studied by the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 cytology while the tissues are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 studied by ethnology the tissues 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.550
 animals 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.610
 they are divided into four large 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.790
 groups of four large tissue groups 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 which are the tissue epithelial tissue 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.850
 connective tissue and tissue 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.820
 and today's class is about the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.820
 epithelial tissue when you think of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.040
 epithelial tissue when you think of 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.729
 epithelium I'm sure you think 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.979
 immediately on the skin no longer thinks 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.800
 true the skin it is not a tissue 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.370
 in fact the skin is an organ and an organ 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.290
 very complex but on the surface 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.840
 of this body we have become a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.530
 business fabric coating that is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.200
 the epidermis keeps epidermis in your mind 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.150
 because if you think of the epidermis that 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.069
 clothes our body 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.110
 you can see which are 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.989
 main characteristics of this fabric 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.959
 what are the main characteristics 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.779
 the epithelial tissue we will install if 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.770
 look only here in my epithelial tissue 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:30.160
 here in my epidermis 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.700
 the rate of cell multiplication the rate 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.070
 mitotic it is high it is low 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.710
 it is logical that the tissues are very high 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.440
 epithelial cells they have a high 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.700
 multiplication a high rate of renewal 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.440
 cell phone 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 everyone should come and talk here about 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.470
 our skin 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.830
 we got a bump of cells 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.920
 killed precisely because of this high 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.990
 multiplication rate another maxim 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.460
 what is important biology is that 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.790
 usually cells that are little 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.400
 differentiated 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.290
 they multiply more in cells than 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.860
 are very differentiated 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.780
 they multiply little eg 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.240
 neurons muscles are very 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.940
 differentiated for that reason that its rate 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.490
 its rate of cell division 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.850
 it is almost null already the epithelial tissue 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.650
 as it has a high rate of division 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.950
 it has cells that are little cells 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.840
 differentiated 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.390
 compared to the other tissues 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.680
 with muscle and connective tissue 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.320
 nervous 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.380
 besides these two characteristics thinks 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.910
 right here in my epidermis cells 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.959
 They have to be very close together 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.990
 separated 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.450
 it is logical that they have to be very 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.180
 joints that are very juxtaposed with a small 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.050
 quantity of substance between them a 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.970
 small amount of substance 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.390
 intercellular because, after all, a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.820
 the primary function of our skin and avoid 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.800
 the entrance of foreign bodies and if they 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.010
 would have been much separated would be very 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.420
 easier for a virus for a bacterium 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.520
 penetrate our body from the same 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.709
 way it would be very easy for us to lose 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.560
 useful substances, for example the loss of 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.450
 water would end up being a water rock. 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.709
 cells were removed 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.370
 too much 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.850
 besides these characteristics another 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.680
 fundamental 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.860
 You have to know, you have to save. 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.890
 is that epithelial tissue is one of the few 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.190
 tissues of our body that do not have 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.770
 blood vessels non-epithelial tissue 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.540
 There is some blood on that one. 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.970
 joking that every child does 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.449
 do it kids health ministry 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.629
 warns 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.580
 I do not do this house and it separates to be done 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:48.879
 exclusively by a professional 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.770
 pick up a stick pin zinho grampinho 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.569
 here from the side of the cuticle then thread 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.580
 here on the finger and leave the pin 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.779
 Hanging like this, you already did that already. 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.610
 I was late 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.689
 leave those pins there and so 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.499
 hung 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.499
 when you leave the leadership 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.680
 I do not have 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:11.650
 Actually, this is because it is 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.969
 because when you do it's in part 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.849
 of your skin 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.520
 you do it only in the epidermis and the epidermis 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:23.319
 is an epithelial tissue is a tissue that 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.240
 has no blood read and another 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.520
 specific feature is that the 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.199
 epithelial tissues they have several 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.569
 embryonic origins 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.479
 There are epithelial tissues that 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.479
 ectoderm of the embryo tissues and materials 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.849
 that come from the same delta of the embryo and 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.460
 others coming from the endoderm of the embryo 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.770
 that is the epithelial tissue it does not have 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.800
 a unique origin fabrics and materials 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.379
 they can be classified into tissues 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.779
 epithelial cells and tissues 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.969
 epithelial secretions and this 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:58.539
 rating we will travel 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.949
 so summarizing this first video the 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.479
 main characteristics of the fabric 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:08.199
 epithelial mitotic rate are high little 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.069
 intercellular substance in addition to 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.439
 cells 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:15.939
 they are little differentiated when 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:17.259
 compared to the other tissues absence 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.589
 of blood vessels is extremely 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.520
 important and finally the diverse origins 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.779
 embryonic 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.459
 Let's see how it happens then 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.459
 classification of epithelial tissue
