the cube is very loud definitely it's

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.029 
the cube is very loud definitely it's
very<00:00:52.039> smooth<00:00:52.629> it's<00:00:53.629> like<00:00:54.050> very<00:00:54.379> hollow

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
very smooth it's like very hollow

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.119 
very smooth it's like very hollow
feeling<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:56.780> feels<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:57.350> there's<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.710> lot<00:00:57.980> of

air<00:00:58.519> on<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.879> inside<00:00:59.210> it's<00:00:59.719> very<00:00:59.960> fast<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:00.920> the

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
air on the inside it's very fast so the

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.400 
air on the inside it's very fast so the
cube<00:01:01.309> is<00:01:01.429> definitely<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.879> very<00:01:01.940> fast<00:01:02.600> cube<00:01:03.170> I

I've<00:01:31.310> heard<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:31.670> cube<00:01:31.939> can<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.240> reverse<00:01:32.540> cut

I've heard this cube can you reverse cut

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.630 
I've heard this cube can you reverse cut
very<00:01:33.259> well<00:01:33.530> just<00:01:33.829> because<00:01:34.040> of<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.250> openness

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
very well just because of the openness

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.490 
very well just because of the openness
of<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.000> corner<00:01:35.329> there's<00:01:35.570> nothing<00:01:35.960> holding<00:01:36.409> it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
of the corner there's nothing holding it

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.649 
of the corner there's nothing holding it
back<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:37.130> don't<00:01:37.520> really<00:01:37.670> like<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.180> placement

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
back I don't really like the placement

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.210 
back I don't really like the placement
of<00:01:38.720> these<00:01:38.869> stickers<00:01:39.320> they're<00:01:39.680> really<00:01:39.920> far<00:01:40.159> out

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
of these stickers they're really far out

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.149 
of these stickers they're really far out
to<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.670> edge<00:01:40.790> there's<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.240> lot<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.509> black<00:01:41.780> lines

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
to the edge there's a lot of black lines

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.289 
to the edge there's a lot of black lines
and<00:01:43.159> that's<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.850> stickers<00:01:44.149> are

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
and that's just because the stickers are

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:44.980 
and that's just because the stickers are
square

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
square

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.050
