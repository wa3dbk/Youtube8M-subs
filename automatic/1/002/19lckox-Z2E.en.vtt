 video guys this time I wanted 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.200
 comment on this controversial average 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 is involving bgs and october 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.869
 the gamers what happened guys 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.150
 some were expelled from the event because 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.699
 it was happening a lot of confusion 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 imagine the youtube game was pretty 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 Who knows, who hires the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.550
 enrolled 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 the registrants go there I want to meet in the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 under the subscribers are many 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 people are thousands of people 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.510
 and if you do not have a structure 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.320
 security a booth an organized area 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 many people without order without rules will 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.780
 give cause the push pushes the fight and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 the event's security guards are going to have to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 turn and go to organize everything that is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 impossible face it was impossible you 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 keep order when you have two thousand 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.160
 people trying to get into a single 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.589
 point that were the ones of October 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.020
 ok and what happened happened feel 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.780
 were asked to withdraw a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.689
 element to see what they are going to do 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.560
 I'll definitely speak to the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.320
 youtube 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 it is I know you want the money 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 You and I know what you want. 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.990
 and in the games event and see the news 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 among other things 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 was from the moment that you are a 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.049
 public person ok 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.799
 a person who has other people who 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.320
 follow and look at you as an example 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.850
 can in an event of this magnitude as the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.009
 bgs if you have a proper structure 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.079
 Face you can not fucking crazy come 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.619
 there on foot 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 Okay, like you do not want anything and wait. 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.470
 that will be all right because it will not 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 to be all right 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.430
 people will want to see you and if not 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.700
 have an organization will have people 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.479
 seeking is your responsibility not the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.520
 event 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.860
 Ok I saw that some in October spoke 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 bad bgs said they should have 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.409
 given a support a booth among others 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.720
 things but the truth is that it is not 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.540
 If they do not have to give them 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.680
 compromise with the exhibitors with the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.780
 sony 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.010
 microsoft that are there and it is to offer 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.870
 content is what the event event of 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.959
 games only non-october 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.700
 unfortunately they could provide support 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.040
 for us to make a structure 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.250
 organized to avoid the shit them 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.480
 could they ok its choice not to do 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.260
 This is because it is your choice to go in 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.989
 event 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.269
 even without structure here is the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.169
 choose from you and from the moment 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.030
 that a choice of you is also yours 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.909
 responsibility to ensure the safety of 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.829
 of its members and its principally 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.359
 If you call the galera pro event 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:00.629
 Ok I honestly have not been in the bgs of the year 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:05.060
 past and the last year because I 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:09.329
 I knew ok that if I had no structure 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.419
 and the shit ok I did not go I did not go 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.829
 This year I was able to go because Alep 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.590
 tinga told the people are we going to take 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.500
 for 20ยบ it has a legal structure to people 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.079
 go there for security, you will enter 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.000
 go out and have your time to talk 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.760
 with the guys and it will be cool and was 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.519
 good thing on 3 out talking to the galley 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 exchanged ideas answers questions was the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.650
 judge of the cosplay event he had there 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.389
 It has no problem no problem 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.760
 nothing with me has no problem 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.709
 none with young nerd for example 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.269
 were there with the warner 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.220
 they had their structure enter not 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.310
 they left good did not give a problem 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.819
 but if you and October went there without any 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.750
 structure will give shit you can not there 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.150
 face and it is not bgs responsibility 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.430
 now has other tricks there from other 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.329
 October swearing or complaining about others 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.949
 of October 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.620
 I will not go in this case here that 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:08.069
 was the majority of the futures that I 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.959
 I found there were super good people here and 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.879
 I have nothing to complain to 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.780
 It was a good experience for me. 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:19.320
 It all worked out, and yes, guys. 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.900
 go if you have the structure if not do not go 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.219
 and that's it, this is my opinion, I hope 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.570
 did you like this video? 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.889
 You will see in the next phase 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.819
 machine machine 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.819
 I went in the arm
