00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.850
 hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.370
 Alexander and today as I promised you 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.480
 I will show you how I am from here 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.090
 blowers 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.340
 from the tractor whether it is matches or something else 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.020
 some kind of air blower fish like me 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.090
 I will make it forced 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.490
 hood for your barbecue 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.039
 as I said in my barbecue 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.039
 almost finished i mean i went out 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.010
 already at the level of the pipe blew do not 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.470
 I wanted and decided to do it right away 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.330
 forced draft to 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.879
 control thrust process 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.250
 that is, I do not need to warm up 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.210
 barbecue before frying before 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 the start of cooking I turned on the fan and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.610
 Immediately I went to sleep 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.510
 coals even purchased without warming up all 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.150
 pipes and I won't have smoke inside my 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.190
 verandas further putting regulator 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.750
 revolutions there is a collector 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.949
 engine that supports 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.220
 speed adjustment 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.140
 change and supply voltage such 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 The controller is the most unpretentious I can 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.369
 control the exhaust process 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.979
 It is possible to make pins and needles one more 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.380
 plus forced exhaust that will not 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.070
 drafts and howling wind in the pipe 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.040
 in winter, the view is less cold because the pipe 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.950
 everything will be that way 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.560
 listen to my veranda she planned 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.799
 closed type what I see cons 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.799
 you forced exhaust of course 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.289
 the main minus the one that I will depend on 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.689
 electricity if suddenly during 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.610
 cooking some dishes from me 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.689
 turn off the light there is smoke will be in the middle 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.030
 premises 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.640
 here of course it will be possible to provide 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.539
 some kind of battery small which 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 will be able to support temporary work 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.539
 hoods 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.819
 The second such small nuance I do not know 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.750
 how much heat will stand 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.450
 Now this windfall can you do 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.619
 big open fire or is it still 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 I'll have to be careful with this I'll 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.769
 start diana here is such a pipe 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.560
 the flange is attached welded and two ears 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.549
 which will be mounted tab 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.390
 flyanets 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.450
 made under the snail open 4 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.150
 the holes will be fixed by yourself 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.489
 languages through paronita-hand prokladochku 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.670
 everything was screwed everything was about 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.459
 it gets great the engine itself 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.579
 was pulled into the tool glasses from 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.510
 the output shaft was once carried on a little 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.140
 big drill 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.530
 Native was on 8 I drilled somewhere 8 and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.500
 7 and the shaft itself was littered and about exactly 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.810
 the size of the new hub now rotates 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.270
 there is no easy chateau 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.270
 and so i went to mount 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.290
 reserve tab since there were 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.569
 and large indented wall 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.819
 while the club frame was cooling off, I visited 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.690
 several segments of our city and already 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.810
 on the third I was lucky in the form of here 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:32.220
 such a thin-walled tube 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:38.709
 and here is such a pipe with a knee 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.610
 Umbrella and mounted on my car 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.819
 I cooked 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:50.410
 here is the knee under the diameter of this one 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:52.959
 pipes so that it comes in tight here 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.489
 so now this pipe 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.709
 can be mounted 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.709
 gave the wall 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.520
 to power the motor i 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.430
 we use this transformer from 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.629
 old black and white tv on it 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:36.740
 There is an output of 6 4 volts 47 amps with one 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:39.319
 side and 6 4 volts 47 ohm 1 with the other 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.150
 I will connect the sides in series 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:47.620
 through 10 ampere diode bridge and on 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.270
 the output set capacitor 2200 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.169
 twenty five volt microfarad 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.409
 here connected 10 220 through the most 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.840
 ordinary dimmer that is at the entrance 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.690
 transformer i produce 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.539
 dimmer speed adjustment let's 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.979
 let's test what happened how to behave 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.979
 my hood
