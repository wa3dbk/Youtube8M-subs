00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 hi i am crazy scientist and primate 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.080
 this turns my side just as it is and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 sunflower came here to net site asked 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.740
 help because she wants to do some 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.930
 experiences in the science fair of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 Her school is that I have no ideas without 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 ideas without ideas you came to the place 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 That's right, and we're going to have an experiment. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.969
 very cool it is with the polymer to 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.250
 to make this experience we're going 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.290
 You need to have everything very sharp there. 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 tacos plock types the one that closes 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.050
 with the like a waterproof zipper and a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 basin to avoid making an evaluation 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.329
 ok then it is so then you help me 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.219
 people start doing let's get the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.250
 our safe basin at this end of the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.649
 Sack take on this other tip let's 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 take this lapse very carefully and we 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 let's move from one place to another 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 I think it's going to happen, she 's married for everything. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.610
 which is hand you think the water is 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.369
 time to test ready 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.240
 Look just to be very careful. 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.240
 attention 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.880
 on one side and the other side only 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.409
 stand up, let's see if we really 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.579
 wet very nice favor lift very 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.479
 cool, right? 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.030
 because that's how it is to test a guy very well 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 sunflower can then put the secret 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 are you not to be afraid when you go 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 on one side of the plastic you have to go 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.610
 with all your might to the other side 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.979
 because if you make a furinho give up 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
 and to make a hole lower down the water 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.000
 It's going to leak, it's not going to work like a sunflower. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.070
 is doing is going to street putting 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 pencil and water is not leaking 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.829
 You know what a good goalkeeper has. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.110
 something to do with plastic 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.820
 exactly the sunflower the book really 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.009
 has anything to do with plastic 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.110
 because in fact all plastic is a 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.200
 and the type of polymer molecules 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.530
 polymer they always get very 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.640
 coiled 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.640
 so it works more or less 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.870
 so put this one very well 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.160
 Are you going to help me now for us? 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.520
 understand a little better about the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.860
 molecules and for us to understand better 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.959
 Let's do it like this. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.330
 like molecules of a polymer of mine 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.030
 career only molecules of a polygraph 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
 so concentrate little ones because 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.430
 they are always in a queue so imagine 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.160
 when we get a pencil and put 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.250
 between these molecules in an instant 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.660
 very fast these molecules separate 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 but she held it again and that 's how 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.040
 the water in the bag does not come out 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.920
 Let's do this sunflower, let's get it. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.330
 others, and now we can 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.880
 practice and have fun for your daughter 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.400
 Okay, so just look at some habits for 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.430
 you to me 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.430
 Did you like whatsapp? 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.810
