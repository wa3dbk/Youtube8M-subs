the water is safe to use you need to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.229 
the water is safe to use you need to
leach<00:00:23.720> it<00:00:23.900> from<00:00:24.079> the<00:00:24.200> soil<00:00:24.410> regularly<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:25.610> by

leach it from the soil regularly and by

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.640 
leach it from the soil regularly and by
that<00:00:26.360> I<00:00:26.419> don't<00:00:26.540> mean<00:00:26.869> to<00:00:26.930> water<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.380> plant

that I don't mean to water the plant
more<00:00:27.800> often<00:00:28.250> but<00:00:28.579> when<00:00:28.640> you<00:00:28.849> do<00:00:29.060> water<00:00:29.360> your

more often but when you do water your

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.080 
more often but when you do water your
plant<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.140> need<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.410> use<00:00:30.619> more<00:00:30.980> water<00:00:31.220> so<00:00:31.970> that

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
plant you need to use more water so that

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.910 
plant you need to use more water so that
means<00:00:32.300> taking<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.720> plant<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.350> sink<00:00:33.680> if

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
means taking the plant to the sink if

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.860 
means taking the plant to the sink if
it's<00:00:34.160> small<00:00:34.430> enough<00:00:34.460> or<00:00:34.940> perhaps<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.840> the

it's small enough or perhaps to the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.750 
it's small enough or perhaps to the
bathtub<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.010> if<00:00:37.070> you're<00:00:37.190> watering<00:00:37.519> those

pena pulled karamja it's very important
that<00:01:03.679> you<00:01:03.769> get<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.129> right<00:01:04.280> species<00:01:04.610> there

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
that you get the right species there

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.970

if we have a mild winter but of course

if we have a mild winter but of course
this<00:01:16.010> winter<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.760> would<00:01:16.970> have<00:01:17.120> frozen<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.570> the

this winter it would have frozen to the

this winter it would have frozen to the
ground<00:01:17.810> which<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.440> also<00:01:18.620> fine<00:01:19.070> because<00:01:19.850> its

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
ground which is also fine because its

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
root Hardy into the teens but if it's

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.430 
root Hardy into the teens but if it's
lower<00:01:22.820> than<00:01:22.970> that<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.480> can<00:01:23.510> mulch<00:01:23.870> it<00:01:24.080> heavily

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
lower than that you can mulch it heavily

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.260 
lower than that you can mulch it heavily
and<00:01:24.800> still<00:01:25.190> get<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.430> through<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.730> winter<00:01:25.910> you

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and still get it through the winter you

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.660 
and still get it through the winter you
want<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.140> prune<00:01:27.470> these<00:01:27.650> plants<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.400> ground

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
want to prune these plants to the ground

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.000 
want to prune these plants to the ground
even<00:01:29.210> if<00:01:29.300> they<00:01:29.450> remain<00:01:29.720> evergreen<00:01:30.260> because

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
even if they remain evergreen because

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.120 
even if they remain evergreen because
that<00:01:31.160> creates<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.670> more<00:01:31.880> lush<00:01:32.390> foliage<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
that creates a more lush foliage and the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.340 
that creates a more lush foliage and the
plant<00:01:34.370> will<00:01:34.520> be<00:01:34.640> less<00:01:35.000> leggy<00:01:35.600> which<00:01:35.930> makes<00:01:36.230> it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
plant will be less leggy which makes it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.530 
plant will be less leggy which makes it
more<00:01:36.500> attractive<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:37.370> needs<00:01:37.970> very<00:01:38.420> little

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
more attractive it needs very little
