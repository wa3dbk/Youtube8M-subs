00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
here you have to leave a space here put

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.050 
here you have to leave a space here put
like<00:00:19.250> has<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.520> be<00:00:20.670> six<00:00:20.970> by<00:00:21.150> six<00:00:21.380> base<00:00:22.380> plate<00:00:23.060> and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
like has to be six by six base plate and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.580 
like has to be six by six base plate and
so<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.539> start<00:00:25.019> by<00:00:25.680> putting<00:00:26.420> like<00:00:27.420> four<00:00:28.019> in

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so you start by putting like four in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.640 
so you start by putting like four in
here<00:00:29.010> six<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.539> sides<00:00:30.810> another<00:00:31.439> four

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
here six right on the sides another four

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.080 
here six right on the sides another four
here<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.099> put<00:00:32.309> anything<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.759> want<00:00:32.850> in

here and then put anything you want in

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150 
here and then put anything you want in
the<00:00:33.180> middle<00:00:33.450> doesn't<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:33.960> matter<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.980> put

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the middle doesn't really matter we put

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970 
the middle doesn't really matter we put
in<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.500> keep<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.680> with

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in there so you just keep going with

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.600 
in there so you just keep going with
that<00:00:39.559> keep<00:00:40.559> putting<00:00:40.920> things<00:00:41.219> there<00:00:43.250> build<00:00:44.250> up

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that keep putting things there build up

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
that keep putting things there build up
build<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.390> build<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.600> also

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
build up build up and then I also

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.299 
build up build up and then I also
recommend<00:00:54.140> using<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.350> building<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.160> many

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
recommend using a building in many

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.490 
recommend using a building in many
figure<00:00:56.670> first<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.989> doctor<00:00:58.379> who

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
figure first this is my doctor who

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
figure first this is my doctor who
minifigure<00:00:59.100> there's<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.359> sonic

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
minifigure there's little sonic

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.160 
minifigure there's little sonic
screwdriver<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.329> use<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.780> scale

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
screwdriver right here use it for scale

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
screwdriver right here use it for scale
so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.420> start<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so I think now we can start with this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.480 
so I think now we can start with this
with<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.600> little<00:01:09.600> windows<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:12.540> put<00:01:13.490> these

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
with the little windows to put these

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.380 
with the little windows to put these
white<00:01:15.000> studs<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.950> things<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> don't

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
white studs or things right I don't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
white studs or things right I don't
exactly<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> correct<00:01:19.259> term<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.560> just

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
exactly know the correct term but just

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
exactly know the correct term but just
put<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.990> right<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
put these things right there on the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.070 
put these things right there on the
sides<00:01:23.420> well<00:01:24.420> they're<00:01:24.540> sticking<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.049> like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
sides well they're sticking out like

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.399 
sides well they're sticking out like
that<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.729> then<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.790> put<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.270> single<00:01:28.020> blue

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
