00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
and some actually sell pretty decently
but<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> wouldn't<00:01:34.200> recommend<00:01:34.350> doing<00:01:34.890> those

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
but I wouldn't recommend doing those

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
but I wouldn't recommend doing those
unless<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.390> pretty<00:01:36.720> low<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.170> reputation

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
unless you are pretty low in reputation

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.399 
unless you are pretty low in reputation
with<00:01:38.159> Detailers<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.479> next<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.079> tea

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
with Detailers so next up we have tea

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
with Detailers so next up we have tea
blossom<00:01:40.979> saplings<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.240> those

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
blossom saplings and what those

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
blossom saplings and what those
basically<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.259> nothing<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.369> actually

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
basically do is nothing you can actually

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
basically do is nothing you can actually
plant<00:01:44.939> them<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:46.020> example<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> autumn

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
plant them and for example the autumn

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.319 
plant them and for example the autumn
blows<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.280> sapling<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.850> actually<00:01:48.149> result

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
blows from sapling will actually result

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.719 
blows from sapling will actually result
you<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.869> giving<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.920> autumn<00:01:50.399> blossom

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you and giving you one autumn blossom

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
you and giving you one autumn blossom
tree<00:01:51.030> same<00:01:51.869> goes<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.320> other<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
tree same goes for the other two and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
tree same goes for the other two and
what<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.490> basically<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.360> put<00:01:54.540> them

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
what they basically do you can put them

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.240 
what they basically do you can put them
down<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.439> stand<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:56.009> being

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
down and then they stand there being

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
down and then they stand there being
pretty<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.119> absolutely<00:01:57.600> no<00:01:57.719> use

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
pretty and they have absolutely no use

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.469 
pretty and they have absolutely no use
so<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.490> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> disappointed<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so I was kind of disappointed when I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
so I was kind of disappointed when I
build<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.960> nine<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.469> those<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.890> twelve<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
build like nine of those or twelve of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.359 
build like nine of those or twelve of
those<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.610> don't<00:02:02.670> remember<00:02:02.969> correctly<00:02:04.219> 12<00:02:05.219> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
those I don't remember correctly 12 of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.530 
those I don't remember correctly 12 of
those<00:02:05.520> blossom<00:02:05.909> trees<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.270> I've<00:02:06.390> absolutely

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
those blossom trees that I've absolutely

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.800 
those blossom trees that I've absolutely
no<00:02:06.930> use<00:02:07.320> next<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.000> other<00:02:09.239> six

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
no use next up we have the other six

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
no use next up we have the other six
that<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.050> still<00:02:10.470> remaining<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.220> those<00:02:11.340> are

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
that are still remaining and those are

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.960 
that are still remaining and those are
really<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:11.849> useful

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
