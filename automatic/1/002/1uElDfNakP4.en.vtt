00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 we 're pretty good today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.950
 in a new server guys like that is 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.990
 we are on the bard server or the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 battles server and well this is a 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.330
 completely new new server created 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.240
 by the same creator of the server 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 this one the lifeboat or william de 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.410
 all live that in the video that are 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 the games of hunger 'sky wars and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.580
 now I was taking out this new server 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.140
 that is the server of several I do not know by 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.539
 what was only guiding so 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.700
 minecraft the truth is that I become 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.310
 crazy to see if he got a bit off this 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.310
 ok i'm going to deactivate everything because a little 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.610
 it's kind of weird that my phone does not 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.130
 so much good support is not a motorcycle gp 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.200
 but good if I do not like that it does not support 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.900
 a lot but things is not the case in a 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.760
 new server created by william el 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.120
 same creator of the hunger games and 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.500
 of the sky wars and good in what it consists 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.770
 that good server is basically a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.870
 pvp server then he and a month skin and what 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.760
 what happens here is that fights fights 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.300
 against everyone or that is all against 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.119
 all this and basically you start with 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.160
 one with an ax like putting some 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 food and a bow and a few arrows 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.939
 ok 3d 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 ok and good, people are finding you 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.509
 people who are at the base and do not go 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.579
 walking and as you go sending 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.579
 getting ok tokens that are the 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.579
 tokens are like little coins or something like that 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.710
 they give you this is as if you had lol see 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.820
 this please what is this 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.520
 I had never seen minecraft and from this 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.170
 way although guys back we're on 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640
 new here on the super server 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.049
 william or how to put me off what is 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.789
 my edited texture that by the way already 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.740
 they had in another video how they were doing 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.439
 saying guys we show up to start 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.590
 it's because of the people when it's dying 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.600
 Spain in these yellow things ok 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.890
 also something that I comment to you is that 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.409
 right now if you find people with 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 any name do not believe that they are 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.549
 because right now you do not ask for a password 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.799
 I know why to play ok then like 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.780
 I'm commenting they are approximately 100 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.810
 people on the server on the server 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.269
 I just now there is one or an ip and 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.110
 I tell you it's basically all against 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.140
 everyone 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.030
 This is also the server's parent 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.980
 because it is that if I am not mistaken 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.940
 green things that I 'm already playing 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.160
 a while 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.110
 with an account with a weird name but 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.900
 as I tell you I'm playing and this 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.180
 when you go through a few squares of a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.829
 macro if it is green or yellow 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 do not improve which one you put so which gives you the 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.640
 life but one of those gives you life and in 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.319
 the others you plan and basically when 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.290
 are you going to go then this one 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.389
 it generates all the life ok and the good thing about 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 the server to the parents is that when 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.989
 you're marking as I tell you it's gathering 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.959
 family touches and that has told us 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.590
 but there is a store and that store this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.450
 when you enter the store this gives you 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.139
 options to buy better things better 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.790
 weapons armor and so on and it gets very 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.620
 fun because you can buy 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.329
 super powerful armor swords of 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 iron 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.870
 obviously each bet more expensive 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.819
 but for example the sword I think of 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.689
 good no no but yes the sword help 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.209
 to kill the iron sword costs but 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.030
 wrong 5 tokens and good every kill that 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.730
 do you get exactly 5 no Baron 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.409
 the sword already laid down 15 touches to see if 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.799
 emerge or in life here we were 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.719
 weird and every time you kill someone they give you 5 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.159
 tokens then you can go together with 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.469
 three that you already have for a sword of 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.480
 iron and do not know lara is really cool 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:38.120
 here I will enter fast or by god and 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.799
 this is good here is the store that I eat 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.690
 power if you touch it is supposed to give you 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.370
 sue the store but 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.590
 is a little bit the server there 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.540
 there's a lot of lag and not just the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.390
 of my device or they tell us about my 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.190
 positive and not those of the good or 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.530
 be the server because I do not like 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.990
 is very well optimized then there is a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.610
 little bit of the but then here we are going to 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.350
 try to kill him something that I love them 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.690
 comment that it is very important in the 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.140
 server is that if they kill them too 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.000
 you can have this as you say touches 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.950
 negative so if they have zero tokens and 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.690
 they get to kill they will have less 5 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.510
 tokens if not about the avatar and do not kill 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.040
 Nobody will have less than 10 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.620
 and so they are adding up then it is 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.590
 something ugly because imagine you can not 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.260
 play well and things like that and well little to 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.880
 you're going to collect a lot less tokens 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.950
 and then you will not be able to buy anything 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.750
 then I tell them it 's a server that 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.190
 is in the testing phase in fact it was 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.620
 okay the candy of william and mentions 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.990
 that this server put together in less than one 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.640
 day I think in about eight hours 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.710
 but if I'm not wrong eight hours 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.280
 it takes to do the whole server and the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.280
 true then 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:50.599
 as you can see a lot of people 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:53.209
 because I'm hitting him there and I do not know how 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.999
 that is not damaged and he can hit me 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:58.569
 I know already got another one is a reaction type 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:00.160
 for a front of they are going to kill 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.140
 okay 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.730
 and if I'm basically recording from 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.160
 Android the same here we have a 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.500
 subscriber the truth seems incredible to me 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.460
 have found a subscriber greetings 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.510
 to mystery in evil and then nothing guys 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.580
 well the hyper said the description as 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.550
 can you see the server still this one 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.040
 it's very high, greets me blue egg 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.410
 the server is very very in phase 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.840
 tests now very planned 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.490
 so if you want to enter then it is low 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.740
 its this how to say it under your post as 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.540
 if his power is already his anger that if 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.940
 it does not charge them well or that is my fault 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.500
 know that it is in the testing phase and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.150
 magical and I tell them to ip in the 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.510
 description is very very easy they are afraid 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.150
 greetings to Gabriel is freddie nothing the 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.860

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.090
 so for six comment things and 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.120
 I could not show them the store and it's 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.300
 because that's why the store 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.790
 I can not put 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.320
 a jerk 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.320
 I already have less 5 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.060

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.190
 see but good there's a good of people like that

 Good greetings to all of them when 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.240
 I did not even notice I swear them and now 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.220
 we found several subscribers this 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.450
 but yes forgiveness for yourself and this is what 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.280
 last the video sorry for having me 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.900
 fired before but now if you do not 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.900
 I show the store because it simply does not 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.060
 I can or sometimes do these facts and 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.800
 I could enter but right now I can not and 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.060
 that's why he's very close 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.320
 the server sometimes lets you in and 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.710
 Sometimes I do not expect anyone to follow me and 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.630
 comes someone damn I'll kill 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.760
