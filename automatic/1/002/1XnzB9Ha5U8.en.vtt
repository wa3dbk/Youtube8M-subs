00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 in order to make us a liquid stone 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 you have to block on ready by two 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 color layers cover top dry in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 lamp and remove the adhesive layer and start 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.520
 done accordingly our design for 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.410
 order for us to do with shouts but we 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 you first need to make a substrate under it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.980
 I will make the substrate of foil that is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.809
 we will do the casting 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 and in order to do the casting we need 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.620
 be sure to zaafit our nail also 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.870
 for casting we need gel paint 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.879
 black tulip name and casting foil 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 now we take gel paint for casting and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 We start to draw our substrate for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.770
 liquid stone I painted the substrate for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.810
 liquid stone now i put to dry in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.409
 lamp for two minutes after we will 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.409
 print foil 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.700
 Olga prints and now we will 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.720
 could make the liquid stone itself 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.760
 by the way for the footrest can also 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.920
 use sequins and sequins 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.800
 sure to make a video in order to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.110
 make us a liquid stone I took the most 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.690
 the usual cheapest one can even take 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.730
 chinese or not important here this is no 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.350
 Role does not play in general take any 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.450
 clear gel and for that we already 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.450
 need stained paint gear i 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.940
 add a drop of stained paint and 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.080
 stir this color 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.150
 sky blue will be on liquid stone 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.040
 and on our thread I'm starting to lay out our 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.080
 gel is decorated with stained paint 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.060
 lay out a thin layer 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.850
 volumes will be sold at the following 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.890
 layer it all uploaded video our gel 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.420
 the lamp will stop pushing for two minutes 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 and the next step will be 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.700
 this is adding volume to our congo we 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.740
 take our gel that was mixed with 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.660
 stained paint and we will 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.660
 give volume to our camera 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:24.810
 all I will betray the volume we see our volume 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.730
 if we put in the profile to joke and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.890
 now we put you to dry in two 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.140
 minutes now our dried liquid 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.670
 I overlap the stone top and put 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 you dry for two minutes i 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.040
 dried our design 2 amps removed 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.079
 sticky layer and now i'm going to gel paint 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.239
 continue to fulfill our design 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.379
 preferably always a holiday or paint 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.170
 no sticky layer 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.400
 as she is wearing a sock longer than 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.400
 gel paint with a sticky layer 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.780
 first we draw white gel paint 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.519
 the contour of the liquid stone and now right on 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.519
 liquid to me we will draw monograms 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.410
 Now we are starting to fill our 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.580
 the remaining white space is the same 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.580
 Hansel me 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.720
 and now without drying our embers we 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:02.910
 sprinkle acrylic powder on it and put 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.460
 you dried for two minutes I shook off 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.470
 rests took and powder and here's how go for 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.080
 by asked this design turned out 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.990
 looks very nice if the main 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.700
 the color is some kind of pale pink gently 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.010
 beige shades also you can 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.019
 experiment by the color of the liquid itself 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.450
 stones you can do and will be red and 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.970
