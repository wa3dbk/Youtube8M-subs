about how to operate the bike
you've<00:02:13.890> got<00:02:14.040> two<00:02:14.220> different<00:02:14.340> ways<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.879> doing

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
you've got two different ways of doing

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.929 
you've got two different ways of doing
that<00:02:15.299> one<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.439> pedal<00:02:16.739> assist<00:02:17.069> system

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
that one is the pedal assist system

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.839 
that one is the pedal assist system
which<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.360> changed<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.500> at<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.620> display<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
which is changed here at the display and

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.600 
which is changed here at the display and
you've<00:02:21.090> also<00:02:21.239> got<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> twist<00:02:22.170> grip<00:02:22.290> throttle

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
you've also got the twist grip throttle

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.910 
you've also got the twist grip throttle
so<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> pedal<00:02:24.540> assist<00:02:24.780> system<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.769> can

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so with the pedal assist system you can

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.679 
so with the pedal assist system you can
see<00:02:26.099> right<00:02:26.250> now<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.819> zero<00:02:27.150> which<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.510> no

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
see right now it's in zero which is no

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.009 
see right now it's in zero which is no
assist<00:02:28.079> then<00:02:28.680> you've<00:02:28.829> got<00:02:29.010> level<00:02:29.939> one<00:02:30.150> two<00:02:30.629> and

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
assist then you've got level one two and

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.830 
assist then you've got level one two and
three<00:02:31.439> which<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.799> low<00:02:32.280> medium<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.790> high<00:02:32.879> and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
three which is low medium and high and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.410 
three which is low medium and high and
how<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.200> works<00:02:34.439> is<00:02:34.680> there's<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.180> sensor<00:02:36.180> down

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
how that works is there's a sensor down

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
how that works is there's a sensor down
on<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.659> cranks<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> bike<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:38.129> will

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
on the cranks of the bike and it will

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520 
on the cranks of the bike and it will
determine<00:02:38.970> when<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.900> are<00:02:39.989> pedaling<00:02:40.379> and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
determine when you are pedaling and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.399 
determine when you are pedaling and
based<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.849> low<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> medium<00:02:42.959> or<00:02:43.170> high

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
based on that low a medium or high

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.759 
based on that low a medium or high
assist<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.549> will<00:02:44.790> blend<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.230> motor<00:02:46.440> power

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
assist it will blend in the motor power

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.970 
assist it will blend in the motor power
with<00:02:47.609> your<00:02:47.730> pedal<00:02:48.150> power<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.859> pretty

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
with your pedal power so it's pretty

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.129 
with your pedal power so it's pretty
nice<00:02:50.190> system<00:02:50.609> there<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.480> other<00:02:51.599> option<00:02:52.019> is

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
nice system there the other option is

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.860 
nice system there the other option is
the<00:02:52.440> throttle<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.209> very<00:02:54.389> similar<00:02:54.599> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the throttle and this is very similar to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.210 
the throttle and this is very similar to
what<00:02:54.959> you'll<00:02:55.079> find<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.409> a<00:02:55.470> motorcycle<00:02:55.799> or

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
what you'll find on a motorcycle or

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
what you'll find on a motorcycle or
scooter<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:57.359> just<00:02:57.540> twist<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> throttle<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
scooter you just twist the throttle and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.509 
scooter you just twist the throttle and
go<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.939> this<00:03:00.150> mode<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.439> be<00:03:01.590> pedaling

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
go so in this mode you can be pedaling

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.789 
go so in this mode you can be pedaling
or<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:03.180> pedaling<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.750> could<00:03:03.930> literally<00:03:04.530> just

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
or not pedaling you could literally just

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.589 
or not pedaling you could literally just
be<00:03:04.889> cruising<00:03:05.250> along<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.819> getting<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.420> free

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
be cruising along and getting the free

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.949 
be cruising along and getting the free
ride<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:07.939> then<00:03:08.939> it's<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.420> display<00:03:09.689> you've

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
ride there so then it's a display you've

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.720 
ride there so then it's a display you've
also<00:03:10.139> got<00:03:10.409> information<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.159> battery

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
also got information on the battery

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.569 
also got information on the battery

and then the throttle twist grip right

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.740 
and then the throttle twist grip right
there<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:50.489> while<00:03:51.090> we're<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.389> front<00:03:51.599> of<00:03:51.659> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
there so while we're on the front of the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.589 
there so while we're on the front of the
bike<00:03:51.930> let's<00:03:52.319> take<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> look<00:03:53.180> these<00:03:54.180> are<00:03:54.419> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
bike let's take a look these are the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.439 
bike let's take a look these are the
tech<00:03:54.959> trophy<00:03:55.470> brakes<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.060> you've<00:03:57.060> got<00:03:57.209> those

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
tech trophy brakes and you've got those

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.890 
tech trophy brakes and you've got those
front<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.440> rear<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.030> this<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.389> zoom

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
front and rear and this is the zoom

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.170 
front and rear and this is the zoom
suspension<00:04:01.650> fork<00:04:01.949> so<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.430> takes<00:04:02.699> a<00:04:02.819> little<00:04:02.940> bit

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
suspension fork so it takes a little bit

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.719 
suspension fork so it takes a little bit
of<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> edge<00:04:03.780> off<00:04:04.139> of<00:04:04.199> rough<00:04:04.590> roads<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.159> then

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
of the edge off of rough roads and then

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.899 
of the edge off of rough roads and then
in<00:04:06.120> addition<00:04:06.269> you've<00:04:06.690> got<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.079> LED<00:04:07.909> headlight

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
in addition you've got the LED headlight

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.469 
in addition you've got the LED headlight
here<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.479> there's<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.310> tail<00:04:11.310> light<00:04:11.579> as<00:04:11.760> well<00:04:11.970> so
