around<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.920> drivers<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.710> allows

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
around the drivers as well which allows

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.849 
around the drivers as well which allows
for<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:56.370> noise<00:00:56.730> counselling<00:00:57.539> than<00:00:58.410> some

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
for more noise counselling than some

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.639 
for more noise counselling than some
other<00:00:59.100> headphones<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.289> don't<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.590> right

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and around the drivers and so it doesn't

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
and around the drivers and so it doesn't
cancel<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> noise<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.070> well<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.310> these<00:01:17.759> do

cancel the noise as well as these do
here<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.990> those<00:01:19.229> costs<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.710> course<00:01:19.979> more

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
here and those costs of course more

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.420 
here and those costs of course more
money<00:01:20.490> than<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.280> gonna
