bleach so it's going to damage my hair
so<00:00:24.430> no<00:00:25.430> I<00:00:25.460> mean<00:00:26.230> there<00:00:27.230> are<00:00:27.259> a<00:00:27.410> couple<00:00:27.619> of

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
so no I mean there are a couple of

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.800 
so no I mean there are a couple of
options<00:00:27.980> okay<00:00:28.489> even<00:00:28.849> if<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:29.090> do<00:00:29.270> use<00:00:29.480> bleach

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
options okay even if I do use bleach

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.290 
options okay even if I do use bleach
which<00:00:30.320> probably<00:00:30.860> would<00:00:31.009> be<00:00:31.369> might<00:00:31.820> be<00:00:32.000> the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
which probably would be might be the

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.530 
which probably would be might be the
easiest<00:00:32.720> way<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.430> lighten<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:34.640> out<00:00:34.850> okay

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
easiest way to lighten this out okay

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.720 
easiest way to lighten this out okay
because<00:00:36.470> perhaps<00:00:37.160> you've<00:00:37.430> been<00:00:37.550> using

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
because perhaps you've been using

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.229 
because perhaps you've been using
permanent<00:00:38.690> color<00:00:38.930> before<00:00:39.460> okay<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.760> did<00:00:40.969> use

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
permanent color before okay you did use

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.810 
permanent color before okay you did use
permanent<00:00:41.629> calm<00:00:41.930> before<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:43.160> cannot<00:00:43.519> make

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
permanent calm before and I cannot make

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.849 
permanent calm before and I cannot make
a<00:00:44.120> color<00:00:44.449> lighter<00:00:44.809> with<00:00:45.140> another<00:00:45.379> permanent

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
a color lighter with another permanent

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.380 
a color lighter with another permanent
permanent<00:00:46.280> or<00:00:46.699> permanent

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
permanent or permanent

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.660 
permanent or permanent
it<00:00:47.510> doesn't<00:00:47.929> work<00:00:48.109> okay<00:00:48.859> so<00:00:49.300> no<00:00:50.300> solution<00:00:50.539> of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
it doesn't work okay so no solution of

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.410 
it doesn't work okay so no solution of
bleach<00:00:52.690> very<00:00:53.690> light<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.289> won't<00:00:55.070> actually<00:00:55.420> be

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
bleach very light I won't actually be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.349 
bleach very light I won't actually be
damaging<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.500> your<00:00:57.859> head<00:00:58.010> okay<00:00:58.550> that's<00:00:59.089> most

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
damaging to your head okay that's most

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:58.290 
damaging to your head okay that's most
important<00:00:59.960> for<00:00:59.989> us<00:01:00.199> yes<00:01:00.739> okay<00:01:01.429> yeah

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.760 

and<00:01:59.300> then<00:01:59.510> what<00:01:59.720> about<00:01:59.750> volume<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.620> like

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
and then what about volume you like

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.760 
and then what about volume you like
double<00:02:01.190> EP<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.580> natural<00:02:02.030> volume<00:02:02.240> oh<00:02:02.690> yes<00:02:03.500> you

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
double EP of natural volume oh yes you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.320 
double EP of natural volume oh yes you
do<00:02:03.950> Marquez<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.700> we're<00:02:04.880> gonna<00:02:05.030> increment

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
do Marquez that we're gonna increment

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.150 
do Marquez that we're gonna increment
the<00:02:05.690> volume<00:02:06.080> them<00:02:07.060> in<00:02:08.060> seconds<00:02:08.950> don't<00:02:09.950> think

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the volume them in seconds don't think

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.640 
the volume them in seconds don't think
it's<00:02:10.399> practical<00:02:10.550> as<00:02:11.000> well<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.350> good

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's practical as well so it's good

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.730 
it's practical as well so it's good
actually<00:02:13.490> wherever<00:02:13.780> less<00:02:14.780> weights<00:02:15.200> about

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
actually wherever less weights about

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:25.660 
actually wherever less weights about
good<00:02:16.100> volume<00:02:23.920> finish<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:24.980> can<00:02:25.100> think<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.489> might

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
good volume finish you can think I might

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.330 
good volume finish you can think I might
just<00:02:25.940> blow<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.270> hair<00:02:26.600> little<00:02:26.959> bit<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.680> get<00:02:28.190> rid
