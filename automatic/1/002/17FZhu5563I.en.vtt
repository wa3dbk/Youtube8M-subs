00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 so here from here to the movie king 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.160
 I didn't break free of the loop 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 he came to his hands 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 kicked my legs to the sides and tumbled 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 hit his head on the floor 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 Therefore, even a lot of situations 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.689
 creating that arms crossed at night can 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.439
 because you paid your legs thrown out 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.080
 the air 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.930
 why grabbed convince that is when 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 happened threw that is i pressed 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.820
 my hand so that the loop is not no strangled 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.800
 we flew with him well and by himself 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.260
 flexible subject very complex very 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.219
 complicated much harder than a spider than 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 knife and if anyone already has processing it 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.870
 like a belt when there is nothing and can 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 dangerous weapons are very dangerous the moment when 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.399
 going on with anything how can you take away 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.640
 and all items with me when you can 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.689
 here it is neatly taken away only 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.580
 they took his knife so that he could 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:14.850
 to plant 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:17.610
 lest not late fall and now I myself 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.240
 arm friends here upsets and this 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.240
 arm that i plant him here 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.800
 and this is how the belt of the tank before we 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.830
 cadets were 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:36.680
 and sounding here a buckle you can like 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.280
 bludgeon them to work on the dedication and 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 on top of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.700
 seen that is itself not accepting or 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 the fork takes hands but to 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.590
 use these magnets which you 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.830
 want well then another knife this one 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.710
 option can turn out so proteins then 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.790
 there is the use of a flexible subject for 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.260
 drink if it is a blow from above 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.650
 express i will have to remove some 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.290
 make 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.390
 You will not pass here with a flexible example. 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.540
 use the rope itself as it chattering 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.730
 will not stop painting 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 so too specific 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:31.280
 he is met and here you can 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.209
 tuck and use fist like 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.070
 or itself 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.860
 belek we are already talking about you can 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.800
 as well as strangle due to turning and now 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.320
 since our such in the center 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.870
 eccentric hands when turning 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:49.420
 here he is already working + gifts which 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.420
 on impact the mortgage is not shaken 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.420
 forget it 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.810
