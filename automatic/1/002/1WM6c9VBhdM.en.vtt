00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.490
 very good to all welcome in addition to 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.799
 ica channel and good as always 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.070
 I bring a new luton test video 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.559
 soccer 2014 this time reviewing the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.740
 penalties foul shots and the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.590
 physical contact engine I've done the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.270
 recovery for what 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.070
 so you can pay attention to the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.820
 animations of two goalkeepers and how it 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.100
 they throw absences 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.880
 and I will give you my personal opinion of 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.540
 each one of these aspects 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.579
 let's start with the faults the truth 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.710
 if I have not caught the trick or is not me 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.629
 it costs a lot with points or without 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 points costs me a lot and 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.149
 try to throw absences 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.210
 the penalties as you have seen here have 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.309
 changed enough will be the fifteenth 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 Once that change the way we do 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 wait before in konami in the pro but 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.140
 Well, here I really like that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 goalkeepers are thrown where they have to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.089
 throw if you send it to the squad 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.640
 goes the squad to try the ball is what 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.280
 strips for the satin stick for the goalkeeper 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.979
 and try to stop the ball there but good 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.159
 the penalty throws are very 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.020
 well done, we need to get used to it and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.800
 I tell you the faults 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 I tried without the dotted line very 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.390
 all deviated with the dotted line 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.670
 some have gone goal or 90% gone 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.009
 goal with danger but still not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.929
 managed to not manage to adapt I do not achieve 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 adapt that to point with the logical 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.399
 right and shoot and keep the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.340
 address with left analog 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.280
 sorry I have not managed to get used here 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 You see yourself getting better and so much curious that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.580
 with buffon 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.790
 I admit that I pointed to the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.640
 right down to the right below and as 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 you will see now and you have already seen it 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.820
 nothing buffon throws it left rasa 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 you will say because not yesterday does not pull 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.049
 he thought he would throw himself in motion 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.770
 automatic but good I took it to a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.299
 my friend in the bayern and in this case not 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.300
 he did nothing because he was thought to hit 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.000
 what panenka but good 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.550
 thank 17 to help me 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.800
 to make this video and good also here 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.040
 As you can see it is very accomplished, it has been left 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 and a couple of plays with fouls 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.600
 physical contact and it's a barbarity of 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.080
 the difference between project and 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.480
 for what is the physical contact here 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.860
 in pro is much more better 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 incredibly hyper mega achieved or 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.380
 is that it is an outrage to dispute a 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.620
 ball and that are there body to body 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.360
 grabbing and struggling that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.220
 outrageous faults are real when 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.800
 you're going to do where depending where 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.120
 where the blow is not compared to fifa 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.739
 thanks rafael the player comes out 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.970
 flying fired a little more it comes out 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.790
 off the field 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.020
 but good is a great one is one of the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.420
 big differences between these two 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.640
 games apart from the licenses but 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.950
 well it would be another subject 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.260
 well here as you can see I'm going to launch with 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.420
 painting a lack with points is worth the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.220
 stop point line to try 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.910
 know how they launched this in this 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.550
 game 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 and I thought I'll look for effect because almost 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.209
 all the faults were thrown straight 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.980
 and here as you see the effect it made me 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.780
 believe in this image that I gave the stick 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.050
 that stopped her noyer 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.660
 but you can see that I gave him so much effect 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.700
 with the dotted line to the ball that 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.730
 now you will see it better where it comes from 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.170
 where the ball comes out that is what to look 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.590
 nothing else to throw and already screw the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.849
 The ball will appreciate it during the shot 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.360
 but well here you see that it goes directly 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.760
 outside and I thought I would go more 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.010
 goal but good to cement 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.870
 missing that I did and now you will see here with 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.510
 with balotelli who tried to pull with the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.489
 instep the Christian ronaldo but with 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.500
 lack of power you will see that the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.080
 goalkeepers in the fouls react very 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.750
 well you have to say it at least 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.819
 Europeans and that in this demo not yesterday 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.620
 and buffon have the bad statistics that 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.200
 in theory it has an 80 something and here 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.879
 has a 77 and 78 each 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.130
 but good the truth that very happy 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:21.600
 for the animations of the goalkeepers and the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.360
 physical contact that they have this year 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.100
 pro evolution soccer engine and about 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.260
 all 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.350
 the penalties and fouls that accustom 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.780
 the penalties I like a lot but the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.940
 faults you have to throw the quiet 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.010
 that once I read leto reassure me and 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.590
 if I master it the same sub a tutorial for 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.230
 you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.900
 and good to say it's the end 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.660
 recitation to the video tell you that in 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.390
 just six days will have a 5th game 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.240
 I'll upload it whole pro evolution
