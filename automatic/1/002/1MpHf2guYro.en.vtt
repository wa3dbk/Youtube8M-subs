but<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.760> showing<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.419> bearing

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
but this video is showing the bearing

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.610 
but this video is showing the bearing
here<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.100> old<00:00:05.279> jack<00:00:05.609> shaft<00:00:06.620> well

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
here this is the old jack shaft well

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.339 
here this is the old jack shaft well
will<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.040> new<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.820> new<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.349> goes

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
will show the new one the new one goes

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.599 
will show the new one the new one goes
up<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.740> down<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.670> no<00:00:11.700> resistance

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.090 

and<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.840> previous<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:20.039> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and this is the the previous one it's a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.870 
and this is the the previous one it's a
little<00:00:20.369> bit<00:00:20.490> more<00:00:20.640> snug

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.870 

so<00:00:24.480> trying<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> determine<00:00:26.099> whether<00:00:26.400> that's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so trying to determine whether that's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.460 
so trying to determine whether that's
supposed<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.359> pressed<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.079> there<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.289> little

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
supposed to be pressed on there a little

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.519 
supposed to be pressed on there a little
bit<00:00:28.619> better<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.329> this<00:00:30.329> one<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.689> 8/10<00:00:31.259> bigger

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
bit better or this one is 8/10 bigger

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.009 
bit better or this one is 8/10 bigger
the<00:00:32.099> other<00:00:32.220> new<00:00:32.430> ones

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
the other new ones

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.990 
the other new ones
8/10<00:00:34.019> bigger<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.220> one<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.699> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
8/10 bigger this on this one here the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
8/10 bigger this on this one here the
old<00:00:36.449> one<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.809> 8/10<00:00:37.199> bigger<00:00:37.470> than<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> one

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
old one is 8/10 bigger than this one

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.569 
old one is 8/10 bigger than this one
okay<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.079> need<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.710> need<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> understand<00:00:41.370> if

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
okay so we need we need to understand if

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
okay so we need we need to understand if
this<00:00:42.480> should<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.780> knurled<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.650> bit

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this should be knurled out a little bit

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.130 
this should be knurled out a little bit
so<00:00:44.159> this<00:00:44.670> press<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.540> nice<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.780> snug

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so this press is on there nice and snug

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.460 
so this press is on there nice and snug
or<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.920> should<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.489> Loctite<00:00:48.470> or

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
or if we should just use Loctite or

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.380 
or if we should just use Loctite or
something<00:00:49.979> of<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> nature<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.640> trying<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
something of that nature so trying to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.610 
something of that nature so trying to
figure<00:00:51.659> out<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> whole<00:00:52.170> point<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
figure out what the whole point of that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.250 
figure out what the whole point of that
is<00:00:54.620> I'll<00:00:55.620> show<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> again<00:00:57.650> how<00:00:58.650> that<00:00:58.890> just

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
is I'll show you again how that just

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.859 
is I'll show you again how that just
absolutely<00:01:01.260> no<00:01:01.559> resistance<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.570> on<00:01:03.570> this

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
absolutely no resistance there on this

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.999 
absolutely no resistance there on this
one<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.500> resistance<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:06.830> little<00:01:07.830> more

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
one little resistance a little more

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.340 
one little resistance a little more
resistance<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.229> been

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
resistance on on this one this has been

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
resistance on on this one this has been
testing<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> true<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.820> should<00:01:12.299> be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
testing this is true so there should be

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.249 
testing this is true so there should be
no<00:01:12.420> problem<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> Jack's<00:01:13.320> app<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
no problem with that Jack's app here and

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.819 
no problem with that Jack's app here and
then<00:01:16.259> lastly<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.600> sprocket<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:19.200> he<00:01:19.530> has

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
then lastly on the sprocket here he has

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.590 
then lastly on the sprocket here he has
pressed<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:21.320> at<00:01:22.430> 2000s<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.520> said<00:01:23.729> 2000

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
pressed in at 2000s he said 2000

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.450 
pressed in at 2000s he said 2000
freshman<00:01:25.049> 2000<00:01:25.710> press<00:01:25.890> fit<00:01:26.659> sleeve<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
freshman 2000 press fit sleeve here and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.410 
freshman 2000 press fit sleeve here and
this<00:01:29.460> hasn't<00:01:29.700> been<00:01:30.289> honed<00:01:31.289> out<00:01:31.499> yet<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
this hasn't been honed out yet or is it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.609 
this hasn't been honed out yet or is it

you know I'll pour it out yeah well this
worked<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.749> to<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.079> four<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.469> three<00:01:37.799> tenths

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
worked out to the four out three tenths

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.410 
worked out to the four out three tenths
interference<00:01:38.729> pair

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
interference pair

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.200 
interference pair
because<00:01:41.110> then<00:01:41.470> we're<00:01:41.590> gonna<00:01:41.680> get<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.280> bearing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
because then we're gonna get a bearing

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.240 
because then we're gonna get a bearing
in<00:01:43.330> there<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.259> side<00:01:44.530> he<00:01:45.009> needs

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
in there and then on this side he needs

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.120 
in there and then on this side he needs
to<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.270> also<00:01:46.540> work<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.500> little<00:01:47.619> bit<00:01:47.860> there

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
to this is also work a little bit there

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.899 
to this is also work a little bit there
so<00:01:48.340> we're<00:01:49.210> wanting<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> sleeve<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.520> here

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
so we're wanting to put a sleeve in here

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.120 
so we're wanting to put a sleeve in here
but<00:01:52.360> if<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.540> can<00:01:52.659> see<00:01:52.810> how<00:01:52.990> thin<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:53.830> already

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
but if you can see how thin this already

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.850 
but if you can see how thin this already
is<00:01:54.369> now<00:01:54.880> we're<00:01:55.659> gonna<00:01:55.750> put<00:01:56.020> an<00:01:56.140> outer<00:01:56.380> sleeve

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
is now we're gonna put an outer sleeve

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.700 
is now we're gonna put an outer sleeve
on<00:01:57.310> there<00:01:57.869> to<00:02:00.570> reinforce<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:02.080> outer<00:02:02.350> area

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
on there to reinforce this outer area

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.980 
on there to reinforce this outer area
here<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.340> then<00:02:03.789> he'll<00:02:03.970> sleeve<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.420> will

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
here and then he'll sleeve it will

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.719 
here and then he'll sleeve it will
shrink<00:02:05.229> this<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:06.159> I<00:02:06.250> shrink<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.580> on

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
shrink this on so if I shrink it on

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.949 
shrink this on so if I shrink it on
there<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:08.080> makes<00:02:08.289> sense<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.630> that's<00:02:10.630> what<00:02:10.840> we

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
there that makes sense so that's what we

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.140 
there that makes sense so that's what we
got
