00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you want to start to swipe from I just

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.369 
you want to start to swipe from I just
do<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.850> edges<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.600> seems<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
do from edges it just seems like the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
do from edges it just seems like the
easiest<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.520> definitely<00:00:57.059> recommend

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
easiest way and I definitely recommend

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.650 
easiest way and I definitely recommend
putting<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.000> sensitivity<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.180> whatever<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
putting the sensitivity or whatever the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
putting the sensitivity or whatever the
scale<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> way<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.949> not

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
scale is all the way up because if not

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
scale is all the way up because if not
it's<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.489> kind<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> hard<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> grab

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's going to be kind of hard to grab

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.010 
it's going to be kind of hard to grab
the<00:01:03.660> edge<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.110> actually<00:01:04.979> swipe<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> have

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the edge and actually swipe so you have

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
the edge and actually swipe so you have
to<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:08.549> messaging<00:01:09.060> app

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to get out of a your messaging app

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
to get out of a your messaging app
before<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> actually

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
before you do this so it actually

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.780 
before you do this so it actually
applies<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> changes

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
applies the changes

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.039
