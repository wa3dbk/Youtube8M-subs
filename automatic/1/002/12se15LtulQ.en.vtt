one is the Kershaw breakout that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310 
one is the Kershaw breakout that
assisted<00:01:41.520> opening<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.780> ridiculous

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
assisted opening is it's just ridiculous

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
assisted opening is it's just ridiculous
you<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.649> press<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> thumb<00:01:44.250> stud<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you just press that thumb stud and it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.240 
you just press that thumb stud and it
flies<00:01:45.030> open<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:46.500> definitely<00:01:46.860> need<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> hold

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
flies open you definitely need to hold

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
flies open you definitely need to hold
on<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.610> because<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.000> aluminum<00:01:48.689> handle

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
on to this because it is aluminum handle

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.749 
on to this because it is aluminum handle
so<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.259> might<00:01:49.439> actually<00:01:49.619> fly<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.399> hand<00:01:50.610> if

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
to tell you is what our favorite locking

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.800 
to tell you is what our favorite locking
mechanism<00:03:56.580> when<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.790> comes<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.060> knives<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.540> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
mechanism when it comes to knives is and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.080 
mechanism when it comes to knives is and
like<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:58.680> mentioned<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.730> have<00:03:59.910> too

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
like I just mentioned I don't have too

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.940 
like I just mentioned I don't have too
much<00:04:00.240> experience<00:04:01.050> with<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.230> frame<00:04:01.470> lock<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:01.890> I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
much experience with the frame lock so I

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.290 
much experience with the frame lock so I
can't<00:04:02.220> go<00:04:02.340> ahead<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.670> say<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.970> that's<00:04:03.120> my

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
can't go ahead and say that that's my

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.600 
can't go ahead and say that that's my
favorite<00:04:03.720> locking<00:04:03.870> mechanism<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:05.190> majority

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
favorite locking mechanism the majority

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880 
favorite locking mechanism the majority
of<00:04:05.640> my<00:04:05.730> knives<00:04:06.000> has<00:04:06.330> always<00:04:07.080> been<00:04:07.260> liner<00:04:07.560> locks

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
of my knives has always been liner locks

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.250 
of my knives has always been liner locks
like<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.790> military<00:04:09.270> here<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:10.050> I'm<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.140> to

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
fact that i've been using liner locks

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.610 
fact that i've been using liner locks
more<00:04:14.190> often<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.880> i'm<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:15.900> used<00:04:16.170> to<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.530> know

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
more often and i'm so used to you know

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
more often and i'm so used to you know
opening<00:04:17.130> them<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.580> closing<00:04:17.880> them<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.060> a

liner lock but i'm going to have to say
the<00:04:19.980> liner<00:04:20.250> lock<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.700> my<00:04:20.880> favorite<00:04:21.270> locking

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
the liner lock is my favorite locking

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.680 
the liner lock is my favorite locking
mechanism<00:04:22.200> as<00:04:23.160> far<00:04:23.520> as<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:23.910> it's<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.450> best

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
mechanism as far as if it's the best

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.240 
mechanism as far as if it's the best
locking<00:04:25.080> mechanism<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.830> know<00:04:25.919> that's

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
locking mechanism you know that's

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.410 
locking mechanism you know that's
obviously<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> air

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
obviously up in the air

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.030 
obviously up in the air
for<00:04:27.540> me<00:04:27.660> right<00:04:27.870> now<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.050> got<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.530> test<00:04:28.710> out<00:04:28.890> some

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
for me right now I got to test out some
