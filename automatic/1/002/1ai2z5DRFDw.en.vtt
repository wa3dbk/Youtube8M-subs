00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
pretty cool now a few mods or at least

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.249 
pretty cool now a few mods or at least
vehicle<00:02:04.500> mods<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> few<00:02:06.090> issues<00:02:06.259> when

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
vehicle mods do have a few issues when

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.869 
vehicle mods do have a few issues when
it<00:02:07.290> comes<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.799> putting<00:02:07.979> barricades<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.700> them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
it comes to putting barricades on them

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.360 
it comes to putting barricades on them
so<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> might<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.950> same<00:02:11.190> for

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so I don't know it might be the same for

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.160 
so I don't know it might be the same for
this<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.660> happened

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this but we can see what happened

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.190 
this but we can see what happened
to<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.500> when<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:13.830> put<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.819> barbed<00:02:15.569> wire<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
to it when we put some barbed wire on it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.930 
to it when we put some barbed wire on it
seems<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.349> working<00:02:19.560> pretty<00:02:20.459> well<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.910> far

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
seems to be working pretty well so far

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.470 
seems to be working pretty well so far
so<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.780> trick<00:02:22.170> out<00:02:22.349> your<00:02:22.760> your<00:02:23.760> ATV<00:02:24.270> if

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
so you can trick out your your ATV if

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.150 
so you can trick out your your ATV if
you'd<00:02:24.690> like<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.170> some<00:02:25.380> barbed<00:02:25.650> wire<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:26.040> be

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
you'd like with some barbed wire just be

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.240 
you'd like with some barbed wire just be
sure<00:02:26.310> not<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.790> whoa<00:02:27.480> alright<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.709> seems<00:02:28.950> my

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
sure not to whoa alright so it seems my

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.309 
sure not to whoa alright so it seems my
graphics<00:02:29.760> card<00:02:29.819> driver<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.569> decided<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
graphics card driver just decided to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.290 
graphics card driver just decided to
just<00:02:31.440> crap<00:02:31.770> out<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> didn't<00:02:33.209> have

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
just crap out just it didn't have

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.850 
just crap out just it didn't have
anything<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.690> do<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> actual<00:02:34.410> mod

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
anything to do with the actual mod

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190 
anything to do with the actual mod
itself<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.090> weird<00:02:36.450> coincidence

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
itself it's just the weird coincidence

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.559 
itself it's just the weird coincidence
that<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> happened<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.700> happen<00:02:39.090> right<00:02:39.269> then

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
that it happened to happen right then

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.830 
that it happened to happen right then
but<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:41.030> caused<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.330> sorts<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.780> different

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
but it caused all sorts of different

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
but it caused all sorts of different
issues<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:44.099> I'm<00:02:44.280> back<00:02:44.519> here<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:46.200> made<00:02:47.130> the

issues but I'm back here and I made the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.420 
issues but I'm back here and I made the
barbed<00:02:48.000> wire<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.569> bit<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.380> serious<00:02:50.160> than<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
barbed wire a bit more serious than it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.680 
barbed wire a bit more serious than it
needed<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.850> be<00:02:51.200> but<00:02:52.200> good<00:02:53.069> news<00:02:53.280> no<00:02:53.670> zombies<00:02:54.299> or

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
players will be able to kill you unless

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.600 
players will be able to kill you unless
they<00:02:57.630> shoot<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.080> zombies<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> other<00:02:59.430> hand

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
there's no chance there's no way they're

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.380 
there's no chance there's no way they're
getting<00:03:01.830> through<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.400> haven't<00:03:03.269> driven

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
getting through this I haven't driven

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.809 
getting through this I haven't driven
this<00:03:03.660> yet<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.160> once<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.250> kind<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.519> get<00:03:05.640> on

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
this yet and once you kind of get on

this yet and once you kind of get on
this<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.269> can't<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.870> get<00:03:07.170> off<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.769> don't

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
this you can't really get off I don't

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.430 
this you can't really get off I don't
think<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.290> drives<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.890> right<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:12.440> so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
think but it drives all right I think so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.780 
think but it drives all right I think so
I<00:03:13.500> basically<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.890> made<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.430> mean<00:03:14.640> obviously

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
I basically just made I mean obviously

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.319 
I basically just made I mean obviously
just<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.810> giant<00:03:16.019> ring<00:03:16.410> parked<00:03:17.160> wire<00:03:17.489> around<00:03:17.820> the

go through the barbed wire and they will
die<00:03:32.220> pretty<00:03:32.880> effective<00:03:33.359> option<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.079> oh

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420
