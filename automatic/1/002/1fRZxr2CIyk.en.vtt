 infinite infinite this business we write with 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.080
 Any name put creative and or 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.210
 survival but i set creative since 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 do not like creative and actually 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 the world is created now you need only 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 wait until it is created and play 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 Now I will show how to find 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.479
 endar cave since it's not that easy 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.390
 very long time to load 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.560
 due to the fact that but understand the shooting goes 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.329
 so many processes hang 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.619
 plus there is only a phone two cores 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:52.200
 plus this phone is not a tablet so here 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:58.560
 so here it lays and when the miner himself is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:04.130
 believes so here you appear on 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:09.640
 the roof of the house in the village and now i will show 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:15.800
 if you want to go directly to the portal 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:19.370
 tom you see a village and there is 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.050
 the path that goes and ends here 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:31.310
 and I have a field like that 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:35.390
 beds so go down to her flowers still 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.120
 grow up and here somewhere here are the second beds 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:45.110
 Th where I do not know well, that's 10 blocks 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:48.019
 I do not know I did not think 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.019
 so here we dig here you can get into 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:56.440
 cave and or in the dungeon if a little 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.440
 another place to dig pro in my and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:08.630
 Actually you fall then not not 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:14.480
 world ok oh so here we are 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:18.380
 appeared near this fell to this 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.079
 portal vandermir truth he still does not 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.670
 working here you can go now 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.609
 analysis cave and creatures entrance to another 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.579
 cave also give more about cave i 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.730
 I want to show you how to get there and it is not 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.790
 dig sooo fast that is through 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.920
 the village through the well is very easy 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:49.100
 You can log in through the deck to create 20 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:52.510
 block damn you see lag me so 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.510
 you need to find only a well 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.920
 here he is here he is here he is well 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.450
 well now i will come in when i go in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.280
 the dungeon is not so terrible lags begin 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.060
 so here it is completely well 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.310
 we just take and jump into our 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.729
 fought I think it will be harder so 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:22.470
 how can you drown yes you can think so i 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:30.690
 put here a stone that was better 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:34.470
 evident that he did not see anything so no 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:42.380
 Now you need somewhere to drop for example here 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:42.380
 even here and and we are immersed in everything so 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:55.919
 This is how we climb now and 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.600
 get into the cave 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.810
 so yes we fall into the cave and you 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.690
 actually get to the cave so i 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.970
 stuck stuck stuck there will be such 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.840
 the door and if you go then come here 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.630
 there is such a place 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.560
 Labyrinth can walk a lot 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.479
 general yanin I found once to the portal 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.220
 then who dug up well and found a place 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.590
 somehow you can just get on top 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.110
 so so its a very long time I look for a background 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.020
 found at night with them splash lags 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.440
 remember it is almost impossible so 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.010
 turkey just a bunch of different rooms they're in 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.169
 basically it looks like he is in the library in 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.650
 the library has a chest and play us 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:50.430
 ripped off here is he comp a paper something else 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.450
 book so there is a spider web you can still 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.510
 climb up 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.860
 there I do not know what to do books to read 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.639
 may up 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.310
 can god turn there fly somewhere 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.090
 the boy grows still you can come down still 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.490
 the cave that is against the gift of the portal can 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.539
 go down to the caves there will be some 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.830
 dungeon 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:18.969
 in general there is very cool but very 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.590
 a lot and shoot it was very long I 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.319
 probably tried to review everything 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.870
 I didn't have to spend 30 minutes 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.620
 I decided to expose a mini review like this 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.419
 Now I think you yourself will not look 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.750
 I studied intriguing to make you more 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.860
 It's interesting to show everything so well, probably 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.229
 put all the likes on it today 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.560
