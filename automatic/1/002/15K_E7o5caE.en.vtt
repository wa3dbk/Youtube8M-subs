top five and i have to say from leading

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.419 
top five and i have to say from leading
lines<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> strongest<00:02:07.429> top

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
lines this is one of the strongest top

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.119 
lines this is one of the strongest top
fives<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.300> had<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.840> date<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> i

very hard selection for you guys to pick

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.960 
very hard selection for you guys to pick
the<00:02:17.680> top<00:02:17.980> winner<00:02:18.610> from<00:02:19.360> leading<00:02:20.260> lines<00:02:20.970> so

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the top winner from leading lines so

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.770 
the top winner from leading lines so
let's<00:02:22.150> get<00:02:22.270> into<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.600> here<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.080> em<00:02:23.880> ECX<00:02:24.880> 65

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
let's get into it here we have em ECX 65

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.980 
let's get into it here we have em ECX 65
this<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.590> an<00:02:26.710> HDR<00:02:27.070> shot<00:02:27.520> but<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.240> incredible

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
this is an HDR shot but it's incredible

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.960 
this is an HDR shot but it's incredible
the<00:02:29.350> color<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.830> awesome<00:02:30.520> even<00:02:30.640> though<00:02:30.850> it's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the color is awesome even though it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.900 
the color is awesome even though it's
pulled<00:02:31.210> back<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:32.020> subtle<00:02:32.580> excuse<00:02:33.580> me<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
pulled back it's subtle excuse me the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.450 
pulled back it's subtle excuse me the
contrast<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.750> really<00:02:35.140> there<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.950> way<00:02:36.280> that

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
contrast is really there the way that

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.880 
contrast is really there the way that
the<00:02:36.580> light<00:02:36.820> hits<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.420> side<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.140> hits<00:02:38.680> this

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
the light hits this side and hits this

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.830 
the light hits this side and hits this
side<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.400> whatever<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.030> monument<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.690> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
side of whatever this monument is I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.440 
side of whatever this monument is I
don't<00:02:41.080> think<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.450> Washington

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
don't think that this is the Washington

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.240 
don't think that this is the Washington
Monument<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.440> certainly<00:02:44.740> hope<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:44.980> it's

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
Monument and I certainly hope that it's

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.180 
Monument and I certainly hope that it's
real<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.730> not<00:02:45.910> fake<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:47.740> this<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
real and not fake but I like this I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.770 
real and not fake but I like this I
think<00:02:48.460> it<00:02:48.550> pops<00:02:48.790> really<00:02:49.150> well<00:02:49.360> especially

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
think it pops really well especially

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.380 
think it pops really well especially
with<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> HDR<00:02:50.800> brought<00:02:51.250> back<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> sky<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
with the HDR brought back in the sky it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.630 
with the HDR brought back in the sky it
just<00:02:52.870> looks<00:02:53.470> really<00:02:53.890> good<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> line<00:02:54.400> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
just looks really good the line is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.200 
just looks really good the line is
leading<00:02:55.180> us<00:02:55.300> somewhere<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.620> leading<00:02:57.040> us<00:02:57.610> to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
leading us somewhere it's leading us to

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.590 
leading us somewhere it's leading us to
where<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.720> are<00:02:58.750> going<00:02:59.460> so<00:03:00.460> very<00:03:01.120> cool<00:03:01.420> that's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
where we are going so very cool that's

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.810 
where we are going so very cool that's
number<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.110> number<00:03:02.350> two<00:03:03.660> Kiku<00:03:04.660> dragos<00:03:05.820> tegel

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
number one number two Kiku dragos tegel

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.920 
number one number two Kiku dragos tegel
dragos<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:08.710> goes<00:03:08.920> anyway<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.060> like<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.720> shot

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
dragos that goes anyway I like the shot

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.420 
dragos that goes anyway I like the shot
it<00:03:10.990> was<00:03:11.110> hard<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.440> tell<00:03:11.590> if<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:11.830> was<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.980> mirror

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
it was hard to tell if it was a mirror

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.120 
it was hard to tell if it was a mirror
or<00:03:12.700> not<00:03:12.970> but<00:03:13.630> really<00:03:13.960> what<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> great<00:03:14.830> job<00:03:15.070> with

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
or not but really what a great job with

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.820 
or not but really what a great job with
symmetry<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.090> then<00:03:16.960> of<00:03:17.230> course<00:03:17.260> leading

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
symmetry and then of course leading

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.850 
symmetry and then of course leading
lines<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.610> lines<00:03:18.640> are<00:03:19.090> drawing<00:03:20.050> us<00:03:20.170> through

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
lines the lines are drawing us through

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.949 
lines the lines are drawing us through
the<00:03:21.280> frame<00:03:21.550> its<00:03:21.970> drawing<00:03:22.150> us<00:03:22.270> down<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:22.750> way

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
the frame its drawing us down this way

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.320 
the frame its drawing us down this way
but<00:03:23.380> then<00:03:23.530> are<00:03:23.830> we<00:03:24.190> crossing<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.880> way<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.240> the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
but then are we crossing this way on the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.910 
but then are we crossing this way on the
track<00:03:25.540> sir<00:03:25.720> are<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:25.930> crossing<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.590> way<00:03:26.770> on

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
track sir are we crossing this way on

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.560 
track sir are we crossing this way on
the<00:03:27.010> tracks<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.640> makes<00:03:27.940> me<00:03:28.090> say<00:03:28.270> what

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
the tracks it makes me say what

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.120 
the tracks it makes me say what
direction<00:03:28.990> are<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> go<00:03:29.620> are<00:03:29.860> we

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
direction are we going to go are we

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.199 
direction are we going to go are we
going<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> go<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.580> left<00:03:30.760> tractor<00:03:31.090> we're

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
going to go to the left tractor we're

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.090 
going to go to the left tractor we're
going<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.390> go<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> right<00:03:31.810> track<00:03:32.110> which<00:03:32.709> way

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
going to go to the right track which way

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.480 
going to go to the right track which way
should<00:03:33.160> we<00:03:33.520> go<00:03:33.810> great<00:03:34.810> shot<00:03:35.110> great<00:03:35.500> processing

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
should we go great shot great processing

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.400 
should we go great shot great processing
really<00:03:37.240> really<00:03:37.570> looks<00:03:37.780> good<00:03:37.990> and<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.170> really

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
really really looks good and it really

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.810 
really really looks good and it really
stands<00:03:38.709> out<00:03:38.860> well<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.280> answers<00:03:39.640> that

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
stands out well and it answers that

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940 
stands out well and it answers that
question<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.330> leading<00:03:40.690> lines<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.110> well<00:03:41.709> as

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
question of leading lines as well as

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.880 
question of leading lines as well as
symmetry<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.180> nice<00:03:43.450> job<00:03:43.810> there<00:03:44.260> let's<00:03:44.709> get

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
symmetry so nice job there let's get

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600 
symmetry so nice job there let's get
down<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.340> third<00:03:45.820> shot<00:03:46.270> we've<00:03:46.540> got<00:03:47.610> evis

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
down to the third shot we've got evis

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.840 
down to the third shot we've got evis

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
then you've got different lines running

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.150 
then you've got different lines running
this<00:04:22.660> way<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:22.930> we<00:04:23.110> go<00:04:23.229> from<00:04:23.260> running<00:04:23.710> this<00:04:23.860> way

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160

of<00:04:38.110> course<00:04:38.410> what<00:04:38.860> cool<00:04:39.100> lines<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.580> mean<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:39.970> is

of course what cool lines I mean this is
cool<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.420> could<00:04:40.600> be<00:04:40.660> like<00:04:40.780> wallpaper<00:04:41.140> if<00:04:41.710> not

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
cool this could be like wallpaper if not

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.710 
cool this could be like wallpaper if not
i'm<00:04:42.340> not<00:04:42.490> talking<00:04:42.700> about<00:04:42.730> wallpaper<00:04:43.510> on<00:04:43.660> your

i'm not talking about wallpaper on your
computer<00:04:44.140> I'm<00:04:44.440> talking<00:04:44.800> about<00:04:44.860> wallpaper<00:04:45.550> on

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
computer I'm talking about wallpaper on

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.390 
computer I'm talking about wallpaper on
your<00:04:45.880> wall<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:47.230> would<00:04:47.500> be<00:04:47.530> really<00:04:47.980> cool<00:04:48.340> to

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
your wall this would be really cool to

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.920 
your wall this would be really cool to
have<00:04:48.670> across<00:04:48.970> your<00:04:49.180> wall<00:04:49.360> well<00:04:49.750> it'd<00:04:49.840> be

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
have across your wall well it'd be

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.480 
have across your wall well it'd be
cooler<00:04:50.170> as<00:04:50.320> if<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.530> could<00:04:50.680> read<00:04:50.890> what<00:04:51.040> albums

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
cooler as if I could read what albums

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.610 
cooler as if I could read what albums
they<00:04:51.700> were<00:04:51.760> but<00:04:52.480> I<00:04:52.630> guess<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.170> that<00:04:53.200> doesn't

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
they were but I guess that that doesn't

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.050 
they were but I guess that that doesn't
really<00:04:53.890> matter<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.400> leaves<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.940> the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
really matter it leaves that to the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.480 
really matter it leaves that to the
imagination<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:56.950> great<00:04:57.220> way<00:04:57.460> of

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
imagination this is a great way of

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.470 
imagination this is a great way of
seeing<00:04:57.970> an<00:04:58.330> image<00:04:59.820> you<00:05:00.820> have<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.060> stack<00:05:01.300> of

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
seeing an image you have the stack of

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.240 
seeing an image you have the stack of
albums<00:05:01.870> they<00:05:01.990> could<00:05:02.200> maybe<00:05:02.350> be<00:05:02.560> laser<00:05:02.770> disks

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
albums they could maybe be laser disks

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.770 
albums they could maybe be laser disks
but<00:05:03.400> they're<00:05:03.640> probably<00:05:03.940> not<00:05:04.150> laser<00:05:04.390> discs<00:05:04.720> I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
but they're probably not laser discs I

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.240 
but they're probably not laser discs I
think<00:05:04.960> I'm<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.080> only<00:05:05.230> person<00:05:05.380> with<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.890> stack

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
think I'm the only person with a stack

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.680 
think I'm the only person with a stack
of<00:05:06.280> laser<00:05:06.640> discs<00:05:07.060> over<00:05:07.330> here<00:05:07.480> in<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.660> corner

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
of laser discs over here in the corner

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.200 
of laser discs over here in the corner
and<00:05:08.080> by<00:05:08.650> stac<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.100> mean<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.310> have<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.550> 90<00:05:10.060> of

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
time but I really think this is a great

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.560 
time but I really think this is a great
shot<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.580> answers<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:15.910> question<00:05:16.060> for

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570
