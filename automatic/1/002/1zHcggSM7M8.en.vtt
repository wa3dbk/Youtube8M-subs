 boris after this elimination play well 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.880
 vincent 3-2 to fight we think about 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.829
 Julian remains too slow which has 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.549
 said I felt in the skin of the guy 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.180
 in pajamas in the middle of the rue vincent 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.390
 moscato 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.400
 no jacques myard budget the worst dorian 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.440
 red of a hall good answer but 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.850
 why this other comes tumbling into the stadium 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.840
 he did not see the match too stressed they 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.190
 tumble the tooth in the context 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.930
 of euphoria said I felt a little like a 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.970
 intruder to the guy in pajamas on the street 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 4 to 2 sebastian breed of shippagan on 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.030
 some world games during all the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.170
 match invest and that's a 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.459
 reference with those who rose to 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.440
 4 am for the match I would have 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.519
 but it was not the case 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.870
 kika says we are not in the 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.859
 best of forms and personally 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.380
 I know I'm not at my 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.739
 best level but I have three months 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.900
 to work there 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:20.459
 lopes lopez gasquet do not have story but 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.229
 I do not think basterds he's even more 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.080
 known as mourinho and how and what 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.760
 tony parker united perhaps lebron james 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.770
 Not everybody knows Kobe Bryant 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.390
 and devices blocked not repainted 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.210
 you all made a grammar shadow 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.960
 no riner is much less known than 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:46.620
 mourinho in the world 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:47.940
 he lost 5 to 2 a minute 40 that's 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.409
 now or never seen the heap that has 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.390
 marked the last test for Toulon 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:57.210
 you know that abbas and mitchell but from 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:07.500
 hole so I meant that it had 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:09.240
 been the best who said smart bison 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.409
 are big nazes because of him I 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.659
 am stuck in the caps I'm going 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.599
 Miss Clermont Toulon I like a lot 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:19.460
 his ball no no it's good no 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.460
 peterborough brings us bruel 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:29.860
 I knew it's always without three 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.899
 I agree I do not want my mouth I 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.129
 risks but that he said he must not the 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.379
 cape to cape town mastering his 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.729
 loose opponent dollars than jean michel 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:41.369
 aulas takes care of his club 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:48.669
 it's Sebastian I think he has but 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:52.089
 julien oliveri joined it's me who reads 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:56.049
 to four questions or not I have 2 left 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:57.639
 3 2 but hey we'll manage Toulon 

00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:58.329
 go down in history and that's it 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.050
 makes sense 

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:05.789
 pinch me the door not basterds the 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.789
 life in these passionate they are 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.860
 numerous 

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:15.279
 no because they do not necessarily think 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.329
 to go greet non locals on all sides 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.939
 but whose story is quite 

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:20.559
 logical eric two first not closed 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:22.119
 but on Thursday they do not necessarily think 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.110
 so maybe he does not think so 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.959
 make him a trial of intent 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.789
 a friend of the deceased speaks only to such name 

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:31.029
 noves our youngsters good answer from 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:35.499
 vincent is that it's 6 to 5 is 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:37.949
 won for strong accent the time is 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.949
 elapsed 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.139
 at
