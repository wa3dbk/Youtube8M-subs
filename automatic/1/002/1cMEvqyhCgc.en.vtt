that<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.549> think<00:01:59.880> would<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.119> awesome

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that you really think would be awesome

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
that you really think would be awesome
in<00:02:00.570> your<00:02:00.689> game<00:02:00.869> why<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.740> add<00:02:01.770> wall<00:02:02.250> running

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
in your game why not add wall running

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039 
in your game why not add wall running
and<00:02:02.700> by<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.030> titanfall<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.840> even

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
and by the way titanfall was not even

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
and by the way titanfall was not even
the<00:02:04.110> first<00:02:04.320> game<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.979> wall<00:02:05.280> running

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
I think water running would be really

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.830 
I think water running would be really
awesome

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
awesome

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.509

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
what that means is all i have to do is

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.869 
what that means is all i have to do is
pre-order<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.769> game<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.579> get<00:03:02.760> into

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
pre-order the game and you can get into

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.910 
pre-order the game and you can get into
the<00:03:03.120> beta<00:03:03.299> they<00:03:03.660> have<00:03:03.870> not<00:03:04.049> had<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> beta<00:03:04.590> for

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
the beta they have not had a beta for

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.069 
the beta they have not had a beta for
call<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.160> duty<00:03:05.549> since<00:03:06.150> world<00:03:06.480> at<00:03:06.629> war<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.019> i

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
call of duty since world at war and i

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.110

actually got to play that beta back man

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.400 
actually got to play that beta back man
i<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.569> was<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.750> same<00:03:09.900> time<00:03:10.110> thank

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
i think it was the same time thank

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.650 
i think it was the same time thank
pre-order<00:03:10.860> or<00:03:10.980> something<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.760> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
pre-order or something like that so that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.270 
pre-order or something like that so that
is<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:12.900> cool<00:03:13.410> dad<00:03:13.650> shows<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.100> me<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
is really cool dad shows to me that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.069 
is really cool dad shows to me that
they're<00:03:14.670> really<00:03:14.880> confident<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.600> their<00:03:15.900> in

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
they're really confident in their in

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.629 
they're really confident in their in
their<00:03:16.109> game<00:03:16.470> because<00:03:16.859> their<00:03:16.980> game<00:03:17.160> has<00:03:17.430> been

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
their game because their game has been

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.069 
their game because their game has been
in<00:03:17.730> development<00:03:17.880> for<00:03:18.269> three<00:03:18.569> years<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:18.989> they

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
in development for three years so they

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.599 
in development for three years so they
might<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.530> more<00:03:19.680> ready<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.250> release

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
might be a little more ready to release

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.849 
might be a little more ready to release
a<00:03:20.639> beta<00:03:20.970> rather<00:03:21.720> than<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.049> two-year<00:03:22.440> cycle

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
a beta rather than the two-year cycle

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.470 
a beta rather than the two-year cycle
that's<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:23.940> interesting<00:03:24.450> to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that's going to be really interesting to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.629 
that's going to be really interesting to
see<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.290> helps<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.069> developers

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
see because that helps the developers

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.910 
see because that helps the developers
really<00:03:27.000> polish<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.690> before<00:03:28.139> release<00:03:28.470> date<00:03:28.769> it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
really polish it before release date it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.559 
really polish it before release date it

about cedar mode coming back the only
thing<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.980> worries<00:03:41.190> me<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.519> I'm<00:03:41.639> not<00:03:41.669> a

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
thing that worries me and I'm not a

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.479 
thing that worries me and I'm not a
developer<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.599> don't<00:03:42.840> know<00:03:43.079> but<00:03:43.889> in<00:03:44.250> black

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
ops 2 I don't know if it was the

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.890 
ops 2 I don't know if it was the
hitboxes<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.730> connection<00:03:48.180> something<00:03:48.599> about

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
hitboxes the connection something about

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.319 
hitboxes the connection something about
it<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.859> hit<00:03:50.340> detection<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
it but the hit detection and just the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.020 
it but the hit detection and just the
connection<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.019> felt<00:03:52.260> super<00:03:52.799> weird<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.250> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
connection just felt super weird and it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.569 
connection just felt super weird and it
feels<00:03:54.419> like<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.690> me<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.319> my<00:03:55.500> personal<00:03:55.889> plane

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
feels like to me in my personal plane

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.300 
feels like to me in my personal plane
opinion<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.780> theater<00:03:58.560> mode<00:03:58.709> might<00:03:59.040> have<00:03:59.190> had

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
opinion that theater mode might have had

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.860 
opinion that theater mode might have had
something<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.730> do<00:03:59.910> with<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.239> because<00:04:00.540> you

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
something to do with that because you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.750 
something to do with that because you
have<00:04:01.049> all<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.709> literally<00:04:02.130> have<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> camera

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
recording everything in the game so like

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.430
