September so like I said it was quite a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.240 
September so like I said it was quite a
significant<00:01:11.700> amount<00:01:11.910> of<00:01:13.070> waiting<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
significant amount of waiting and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.790 
significant amount of waiting and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
haven't had our closing yet so they

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.080 
haven't had our closing yet so they
haven't<00:01:43.470> broken<00:01:43.830> ground<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.610> hopefully

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
haven't broken ground but hopefully

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
haven't broken ground but hopefully
that'll<00:01:45.300> be<00:01:45.390> coming<00:01:45.660> up<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.170> next<00:01:46.530> two<00:01:47.280> or

that'll be coming up in the next two or

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.390 
that'll be coming up in the next two or
three<00:01:47.670> weeks<00:01:47.910> so<00:01:48.270> anyway<00:01:49.080> that's<00:01:49.950> what's<00:01:50.220> been

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
three weeks so anyway that's what's been

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.620 
three weeks so anyway that's what's been
going<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.120> me<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.730> for<00:01:53.730> whatever<00:01:53.910> reason

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
going on with me and for whatever reason

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.140

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
all of that stuff has either taken up

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.690 
all of that stuff has either taken up
all<00:01:57.300> my<00:01:57.450> time<00:01:57.690> or<00:01:58.050> just<00:01:58.080> completely<00:01:58.890> zapped<00:01:59.430> my

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
all my time or just completely zapped my

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.180 
all my time or just completely zapped my
creativity<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:03.440> felt<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:05.040> know

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
creativity I just have not felt you know

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.940 
creativity I just have not felt you know
the<00:02:05.820> urge<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> create<00:02:06.690> anything<00:02:07.350> I've<00:02:07.590> come<00:02:07.830> up

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the urge to create anything I've come up

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.070 
the urge to create anything I've come up
a<00:02:08.069> couple<00:02:08.099> times<00:02:08.369> into<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.209> craft<00:02:09.479> room<00:02:09.690> here

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
a couple times into my craft room here

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.640 
a couple times into my craft room here
and<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:12.090> nothing<00:02:12.300> sparked<00:02:12.930> at<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and just nothing sparked at all so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
and just nothing sparked at all so
hopefully<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.670> over<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.090> now

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
hopefully I'm going to be over that now

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.440 
hopefully I'm going to be over that now
that<00:02:15.690> things<00:02:15.930> are<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.260> upswing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that things are on the upswing

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
which I use constantly but this one has

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.860 
which I use constantly but this one has
a<00:05:08.270> slightly<00:05:08.960> different<00:05:09.820> width<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.600> grass

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
because the lawn fawn one is just a

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.280 
because the lawn fawn one is just a
straight<00:05:18.700> across<00:05:19.700> line<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.510> grass<00:05:20.720> like<00:05:21.080> that

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.410 
straight across line of grass like that
one<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.830> I<00:05:22.310> really<00:05:22.670> wanted<00:05:23.000> something<00:05:23.270> that

one and I really wanted something that

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.420 
one and I really wanted something that
looked<00:05:23.570> more<00:05:24.080> like<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.290> hillside<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.100> can<00:05:25.250> see

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430
