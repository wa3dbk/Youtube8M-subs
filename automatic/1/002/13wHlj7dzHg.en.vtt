flavor essentially if you said yeah this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.539 
flavor essentially if you said yeah this
is<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.930> had<00:01:25.229> some<00:01:25.650> ramen<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
open up the flavor packet and just dump

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.670 
open up the flavor packet and just dump
it<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:29.450> that's<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:31.020> that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.560> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it in there that's that's that's what we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.300 
it in there that's that's that's what we
have<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.070 

and<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> pretty<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.700> tastes<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> too

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
and it pretty much tastes like that too

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.080 
and it pretty much tastes like that too
very<00:01:40.740> bland<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> say<00:01:43.580> not<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
very bland that when I say not a lot of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.109 
very bland that when I say not a lot of
flavor

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.950 

there's<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.200> smallest<00:01:52.979> hint<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.690> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
there's just the smallest hint of what I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.260 
there's just the smallest hint of what I
could<00:01:55.020> describe<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:58.009> tomato<00:01:59.009> sauce<00:01:59.700> with

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
could describe as like tomato sauce with

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.210 
could describe as like tomato sauce with
some<00:02:00.540> Italian<00:02:00.690> seasoning<00:02:01.440> in<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.009> that's

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
some Italian seasoning in it that's

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.890 
some Italian seasoning in it that's
that's<00:02:02.430> pretty<00:02:02.850> much<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.300> only<00:02:03.330> hint<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
that's pretty much the only hint of

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's pretty much the only hint of
flavor<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:07.670> man<00:02:09.500> that's<00:02:10.500> it
