00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.650
 It is a replacement of the small part of the keyboard. It is like an eco. Small part 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.249
 Not only the remaining color has changed, but 8 has come back 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:14.749
 If you leave this as it is, this equipment is for men 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.179
 It's getting tougher 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.099
 This is a strange thing, but it is this part 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.670
 Appointed as an airport 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.160
 The keyboard blows up when you come in contact with the second place 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.619
 I did not come back 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589
 As you can do Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.800
 High school days are accompanied by an understanding The film scene like this 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650
 In the wind 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.860
 The small and integral type is this press but it's worth 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.170
 The proposal is 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.860
 This part and this part tear 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.930
 Head coach is acrylic and it is acrylic 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.150
 Because I used this celluloid, it is a part that I am allowed to make 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.870
 Because it deforms well, so the color also changes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.830
 I'm trying to replace it and I want to try it 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.830
 I think 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 There will always be opportunities for growth 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 I'm looking for my voice 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.990
 It's only inside the airport, so I'm going to change it like this 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.990
 It becomes such a form 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.990
 That's where you are at that time 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.370
 Even though it is eco 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.370
 Apply glue 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.550
 Because with 02 02 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.550
 I do not need it 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 It looks like it's on one side 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.099
 Later this part is a sharp eye 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.589
 I will add it in this 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.400
 British function 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.270
 Because spring is over 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.539
 Pick up the eco-friendly anti-soiling vinyl 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.549
 It is a part that came out of the economy I want to cut the part of the eco 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.549
 I think 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.609
 Ah 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
 I'm off after as much as possible 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 Actually 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.629
 And after all the times are over 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.639
 What is hdd? About 60% of those days 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.090
 About 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.090
 I think from the bottom at 8 o'clock 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.609
 I want to smile and finish it with this 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.869
 It can not be done
