bunch<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.170> stuff<00:01:51.380> now<00:01:51.770> my<00:01:51.950> theory<00:01:52.399> is<00:01:52.609> that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
bunch of stuff now my theory is that

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.429 
bunch of stuff now my theory is that
Microsoft<00:01:53.299> knows<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.200> fuck<00:01:54.380> they're

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
Microsoft knows what the fuck they're

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.529 
Microsoft knows what the fuck they're
doing<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.130> there's<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.729> reason<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.390> these

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
doing and there's a reason that these

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.739 
doing and there's a reason that these
games<00:01:56.840> are<00:01:57.020> 720p<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.159> not<00:01:58.700> pushing<00:01:59.329> the

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
games are 720p and not pushing the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:03.219 
games are 720p and not pushing the
limits<00:02:00.200> at<00:02:00.469> 1080p<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.670> 60<00:02:02.119> frames<00:02:02.359> per<00:02:02.509> second

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
limits at 1080p and 60 frames per second

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.069 
limits at 1080p and 60 frames per second
Microsoft<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.159> playing<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.549> safe<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.240> also

review<00:02:06.710> tech<00:02:06.950> USA<00:02:07.429> came<00:02:07.729> out<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.090> said<00:02:08.300> that

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
review tech USA came out and said that

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.620 
review tech USA came out and said that
the<00:02:08.630> Xbox<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.410> version<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:10.039> Battlefield<00:02:10.880> 4<00:02:11.360> is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
the Xbox one version of Battlefield 4 is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.200 
the Xbox one version of Battlefield 4 is
running<00:02:11.990> much<00:02:12.319> smoother<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.130> has<00:02:13.790> more

running much smoother and has more

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.710 
running much smoother and has more
players<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.620> my<00:02:15.800> theory<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:16.520> guys<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:17.120> that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
players so my theory here guys is that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.140 
players so my theory here guys is that
Microsoft<00:02:18.560> knows<00:02:19.220> what<00:02:19.520> they're<00:02:19.670> doing<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
Microsoft knows what they're doing and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.240 
Microsoft knows what they're doing and
there's<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.480> reason<00:02:20.930> their<00:02:21.080> settings<00:02:21.410> 10%

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
there's a reason their settings 10%

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.520 
there's a reason their settings 10%
aside<00:02:22.580> for

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
aside for

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.110 
aside for
connect<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.130> don't<00:02:24.310> think<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:24.730> really

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
connect and I don't think it's really

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.809 
connect and I don't think it's really
10%<00:02:25.750> needed<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.410> connect<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:27.010> think<00:02:27.640> they

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
10% needed for the connect I think they

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.550 
10% needed for the connect I think they
want<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> make<00:02:28.270> sure<00:02:28.300> their<00:02:28.810> console<00:02:29.290> doesn't

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
want to make sure their console doesn't

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.770 
want to make sure their console doesn't
overheat<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.310> doesn't<00:02:31.060> have<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.209> problems

that doesn't work and I went through the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.050 
that doesn't work and I went through the
red<00:03:58.810> ring<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.260> death<00:03:59.320> on<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> Xbox<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.970> I

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
red ring of death on the Xbox and I

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.420 
red ring of death on the Xbox and I
think<00:04:01.329> that's<00:04:01.570> why<00:04:01.900> Microsoft<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.859> playing<00:04:03.220> it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
think that's why Microsoft is playing it

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.840 
think that's why Microsoft is playing it
smart<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.150> playing<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.989> safe<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.650> not<00:04:05.850> trying

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
smart and playing it safe and not trying

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.150 
smart and playing it safe and not trying
to<00:04:06.970> push<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.390> console<00:04:07.840> past<00:04:08.200> its<00:04:08.530> limits<00:04:08.980> and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
to push the console past its limits and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.009 
to push the console past its limits and
people<00:04:09.790> will<00:04:09.970> say<00:04:10.180> oh<00:04:10.390> you're<00:04:10.690> getting<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
people will say oh you're getting the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.979 
people will say oh you're getting the
shitty<00:04:11.230> console<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.890> has<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.790> know<00:04:12.989> 720p

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
shitty console that has you know 720p

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.279 
shitty console that has you know 720p
and<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.890> isn't<00:04:15.400> trying<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:16.229> compete<00:04:17.229> with

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
and and isn't trying to compete with

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.240 
and and isn't trying to compete with
1080p

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
1080p

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.670 
1080p
well<00:04:18.760> maybe<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.180> games<00:04:19.390> just<00:04:19.539> have<00:04:19.930> so<00:04:20.410> much

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
well maybe the games just have so much

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.370 
well maybe the games just have so much
going<00:04:21.100> on<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.910> if<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.390> put<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.750> at<00:04:22.870> 1080p

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
going on that if you put it at 1080p

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.010 
going on that if you put it at 1080p
there<00:04:24.070> would<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.220> some<00:04:24.550> serious<00:04:25.020> serious

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
there would be some serious serious

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.110 
there would be some serious serious
problems<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:27.039> I<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.789> trust<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.930> Microsoft<00:04:29.470> is

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
problems and I I trust that Microsoft is

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.610 
problems and I I trust that Microsoft is
