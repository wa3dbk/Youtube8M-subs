00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.700
 it's good that if you're with us because the day that today is taking 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.630
 a delicious dessert very old I mean a few cream chicks 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.039
 peanut 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.939
 bollitos is the name with which the homemade kikitos of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.140
 a texture type muffin 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.859
 percent this recipe pretty much is over there from the fifties sixties 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.029
 until then it's worth it to write down 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.730
 If you are not starting to see the only thing we have done good 1 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.010
 is to recommend that you have the butter at room temperature to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.360
 can the cream 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
 I'm going to start this process the crosses also out there place the cream 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.790
 of peanut that is half a cup of peanut butter trochi 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.000
 with three quarters the butter bar tape 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 I go to the apra that the blender 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.650
 avite that we are premiering this 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.900
 this case where you can have better 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.900
 let's start incorporating 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.870
 once this is incorporated correctly 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.420
 I'm going to stop 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.270
 to incorporate sugar once and for all 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.800
 and here we are going to use in these bonitos what is the mascabado sugar 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.310
 which makes this recipe much more nutritious because it is a sugar that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.830
 it digests much more 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.480
 the refined sugar 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.370
 and also gives a delicious flavor that we never have with traditional sugar 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.920
 PS I'm going to stay here your tips I want to tell you the sugar cost yesterday to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.900
 a house 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.080
 important that pedophilia is very good if you bite the super masquerade 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.620
 usually 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.200
 insists that the people who see us in the United States the sugar is the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.720
 opera a city that comes in two colors 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.770
 and here I am currently using the clearest sugar online 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.229
 brown sugar that sees them sometimes they ask us through internet to 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.060
 through our website and facebook and dissipated life service 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.570
 is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.900
 is the sugar muscovado do not know this term so you know by now that 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.079
 The programing 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.189
 when you look at sugar mascabado it is very important that the square in very well 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.669
 because these local has a lot of volume 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:21.259
 then it is important to crush to use the correct amount that 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.839
 in this case it would be a peace 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:24.889
 Yes now 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.999
 I'm going to start beating 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.999
 we have our ingredients injured what the law says 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.379
 together with the baking powder 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.329
 the farc 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.649
 Cecilia join the single occasion and the flour is low protein 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.179
 I come here the two eggs 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.179
 I'm going to start incorporating the game at the same time 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.869
 same I will not stop to move the bottom I ask next to our past 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.139
 add Moscow 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.389
 I'm going to inherit the second act 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.959
 you have to give opportunity to start integrating correctly I will 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:01.229
 do 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.229
 It was a little bit of speed 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.619
 went down a bit of goya integrate 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.559
 and I'm going to aromatize with the vanilla 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.459
 if all goes the thousand in the avenue sinsabor that no 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.519
 highlight the main flavors of a recipe 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.709
 and in this case with a delicious 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.209
 people with what is peanut butter 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.219
 I'm going to stop here 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.119
 and what I'm going to do 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.429
 I'm going to move the bottom and sides of mita are to incorporate everything 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:38.689
 correctly 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.579
 you know that our party hours one of the things that we always have to 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.489
 do 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.300
 is to make sure that everything is being condemned correctly so that 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.839
 Sometimes it is recommended 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:52.849
 stop once or twice to be able to the legislator 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.189
 very well the bottom on the sides i in corporate correctly all the 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.189
 inventions 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.319
 one more step to add 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.739
 in this process of extremadura 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.359
 I'm adding air 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.359
 I'm giving it flight 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.620
 there is a very fine texture 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
 of what is the loaves and 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.490
 a little bit more speed 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.860
 it is important to give 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.069
 for what 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 we can have out there 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.699
 you have to have for and alhama 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.699
 what are the mountains where I am going to vote 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 the rolls 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.490
 one is going to be what is the one Egypt has brought 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.879
 of drowning and all regular size 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.879
 you can use sneakers 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.599
 currently for cyclists 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.599
 and you can also use a tray because I want to make 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 in a special way 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.729
 let's review how they go to that mix 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.490
 I'm going to slow down 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.819
 here it is important to see that it is expected to cremate 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:22.840
 if you notice 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.990
 begins to lower the color of our smoothie 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.150
 begins to take on a more spongy texture and it is important to make sure 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.740
 that we do not have 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.569
 good triumph quotes the speed 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.860
 and in that moment we would be ready to start incorporating 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.669
 alternately lopez or not 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.259
 indeed effect 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.309
 along with the milk that is important to be the people 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:47.289
 in this case three-quarters of success with duckling the speed 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.069
 I know what he will do 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.039
 I'm going to go down to Brazil 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.009
 I'm going to lower the speed again 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.729
 I will lower it to the minimum 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.430
 the aek out there these blenders have a function that says 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.260
 is true what it is to combine in that function at that speed is where are we going 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.939
 to start incorporating 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.260
 what are the tecos 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.930
 seven make nests 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.930
 together with the milk 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:34.809
 today it will begin to incorporate the dry ingredients 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.979
 now we're going to peace year, the only thing I'm going to do 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.479
 incorporate percent as 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.240
 a drill that are the dry ingredients 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.080
 alternating with milk is very important that is finally 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.740
 let's finish with the following texts that is that 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.729
 old 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.610
 that makes the buns for the successes look much better so you 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.319
 I see the return
