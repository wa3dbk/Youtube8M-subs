00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.630 
is not as many as we're a custom buddy
who's<00:02:16.329> playing<00:02:16.599> hurt<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.739> they're<00:02:18.220> obviously

who's playing hurt so they're obviously

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.850 
who's playing hurt so they're obviously
going<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.909> go<00:02:19.030> into<00:02:19.180> preventive<00:02:19.989> training

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
going to go into preventive training

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.530 
going to go into preventive training
where<00:02:21.099> they're<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.670> build<00:02:21.879> up<00:02:22.060> muscles

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
where they're going to build up muscles

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.390 
where they're going to build up muscles
to<00:02:23.110> prevent<00:02:23.530> further<00:02:23.739> injuries<00:02:24.250> from

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
to prevent further injuries from

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.550 
to prevent further injuries from
happening<00:02:24.569> Tim<00:02:25.569> Grover<00:02:25.959> will<00:02:26.140> give<00:02:26.290> him<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
happening Tim Grover will give him a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.319 
happening Tim Grover will give him a
dietary<00:02:27.099> regimen<00:02:27.640> he<00:02:27.819> will<00:02:27.939> give<00:02:28.090> him<00:02:28.239> a

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
dietary regimen he will give him a

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.880 
dietary regimen he will give him a
training<00:02:28.689> regiment<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.290> use<00:02:29.470> throughout<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
training regiment to use throughout the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.250 
training regiment to use throughout the
season<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:31.299> think<00:02:31.540> dwyane<00:02:31.750> wade's<00:02:31.959> in<00:02:32.079> good

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
season and I think dwyane wade's in good

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.990 
season and I think dwyane wade's in good
hands<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.829> think<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.310> rest<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.700> us<00:02:33.849> were

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
hands and I think the rest of us were

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.270 
hands and I think the rest of us were
fans<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.420> other<00:02:34.569> teams<00:02:34.900> could<00:02:35.799> be<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.040> trouble

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
fans of other teams could be in trouble

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.819 
fans of other teams could be in trouble
Dwyane<00:02:37.120> Wade<00:02:37.299> comes<00:02:37.569> back<00:02:37.810> better<00:02:38.439> than<00:02:38.590> ever

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
Dwyane Wade comes back better than ever

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.500 
Dwyane Wade comes back better than ever
well<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.819> guys<00:02:39.970> think<00:02:40.209> i<00:02:40.510> think<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.560> uh<00:02:41.739> i

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
well you guys think i think that uh i

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.119 
well you guys think i think that uh i
think<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.750> he<00:02:43.870> needs<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.409> build<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.769> his<00:02:44.859> body

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
think that he needs to build up his body

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.740 
think that he needs to build up his body
in<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.340> certain<00:02:45.489> way<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> prevent<00:02:46.209> his<00:02:46.420> injury

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
in a certain way to prevent his injury

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.360 
in a certain way to prevent his injury
but<00:02:46.959> i<00:02:46.989> think<00:02:47.290> at<00:02:47.409> this<00:02:47.500> point<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.190> you

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
but i think at this point just like you

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.430 
but i think at this point just like you
had<00:02:48.489> just<00:02:48.609> mentioned<00:02:48.819> Pat<00:02:49.209> Riley<00:02:49.420> said<00:02:49.750> that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
had just mentioned Pat Riley said that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.050 
had just mentioned Pat Riley said that
he<00:02:50.620> needs<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.889> find<00:02:51.220> his<00:02:51.430> basketball<00:02:51.970> skills

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
he needs to find his basketball skills

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.780 
he needs to find his basketball skills
again<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.859> he<00:02:53.950> wants<00:02:54.159> him<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.340> drop<00:02:54.579> weight

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
again and he wants him to drop weight

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.180 
again and he wants him to drop weight
what<00:02:55.629> I<00:02:55.659> take<00:02:55.900> from<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.290> feel<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:56.889> maybe

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
what I take from that I feel like maybe

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.429 
what I take from that I feel like maybe
it<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.819> know<00:02:57.940> when<00:02:58.629> i<00:02:58.659> watch<00:02:58.870> Dwyane<00:02:59.230> Wade

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
it you know when i watch Dwyane Wade

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.740 
it you know when i watch Dwyane Wade
compared<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.099> early<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:00.549> his<00:03:00.670> career<00:03:00.819> he<00:03:01.329> does

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
compared to early in his career he does

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.390 
compared to early in his career he does
feel<00:03:02.049> he<00:03:02.379> doesn't<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.889> know<00:03:02.950> how<00:03:03.129> they<00:03:03.250> used

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
feel he doesn't you know how they used

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.849 
feel he doesn't you know how they used
to<00:03:03.430> comb<00:03:03.670> flash<00:03:04.090> he<00:03:04.329> doesn't<00:03:04.629> that<00:03:05.470> quickness

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
to comb flash he doesn't that quickness

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.979 
to comb flash he doesn't that quickness
and<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.760> first<00:03:07.090> step<00:03:07.359> doesn't<00:03:07.750> seem<00:03:07.870> to

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
and that that first step doesn't seem to

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.140 
and that that first step doesn't seem to
be<00:03:08.109> there<00:03:08.290> as<00:03:08.409> much<00:03:08.590> obviously<00:03:09.069> injuries<00:03:09.970> are

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
be there as much obviously injuries are

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.270 
be there as much obviously injuries are
involved<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.620> he's<00:03:11.829> honestly<00:03:12.220> a

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
involved but I think he's honestly a

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.619 
involved but I think he's honestly a
little<00:03:12.340> bit<00:03:12.579> too<00:03:12.700> muscle-bound<00:03:13.269> at<00:03:13.510> this

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
little bit too muscle-bound at this

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.960 
little bit too muscle-bound at this
point<00:03:13.870> maybe<00:03:14.019> he<00:03:14.200> should<00:03:14.500> drop<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.790> should

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
point maybe he should drop you should

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.429 
point maybe he should drop you should
drop<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.209> little<00:03:16.510> bit<00:03:16.659> of<00:03:16.750> weight<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.349> know

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
drop a little bit of weight and you know

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.589 
drop a little bit of weight and you know
refine<00:03:17.919> his<00:03:18.129> skills<00:03:18.190> again<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.090> working<00:03:19.510> with

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
refine his skills again but working with

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.300 
refine his skills again but working with
a<00:03:19.629> guy<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:19.840> Tim<00:03:20.169> Grover<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.829> mean<00:03:21.010> there's<00:03:21.190> no

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
a guy like Tim Grover I mean there's no

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.759 
a guy like Tim Grover I mean there's no
there's<00:03:21.549> nobody<00:03:21.699> better<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.510> why<00:03:23.290> would<00:03:23.650> you

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
there's nobody better so why would you

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.890 
there's nobody better so why would you
say<00:03:23.889> 15<00:03:24.370> pounds<00:03:24.819> 20<00:03:25.150> pounds<00:03:25.180> i<00:03:25.629> would<00:03:25.750> say

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
say 15 pounds 20 pounds i would say

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.289 
say 15 pounds 20 pounds i would say
about<00:03:25.989> 15<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.590> 20<00:03:26.709> pounds<00:03:27.220> not<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> muscle<00:03:27.819> but

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
about 15 to 20 pounds not a muscle but

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.509 
about 15 to 20 pounds not a muscle but
in<00:03:28.510> general<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:29.109> pounds<00:03:29.709> yeah<00:03:29.889> just<00:03:30.280> drop

in general just pounds yeah just drop

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.729 
in general just pounds yeah just drop
way<00:03:30.730> maybe<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.389> think<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.290> he<00:03:32.440> should<00:03:32.620> I

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
way maybe I think I think he should I

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:33.960 
way maybe I think I think he should I
don't<00:03:32.889> know<00:03:32.949> what<00:03:33.099> he<00:03:33.190> was<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.519> his<00:03:33.609> younger

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
don't know what he was in his younger

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.680 
don't know what he was in his younger
but<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.180> know<00:03:34.299> if<00:03:34.389> he<00:03:34.480> could<00:03:34.629> be<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:34.930> 205

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
but you know if he could be like 205

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.289 
but you know if he could be like 205
something<00:03:37.690> like<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.319> 10<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:40.000> he's

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
something like that to 10 because he's

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.899 
something like that to 10 because he's
probably<00:03:40.449> like<00:03:40.840> 220<00:03:41.409> 225<00:03:41.949> now<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:42.639> I<00:03:42.760> mean

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
probably like 220 225 now but I mean

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.280 
probably like 220 225 now but I mean
it's<00:03:43.060> not<00:03:43.180> all<00:03:43.329> about<00:03:43.359> his<00:03:43.720> weight<00:03:43.930> he<00:03:44.109> needs

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
it's not all about his weight he needs

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.469 
it's not all about his weight he needs
to<00:03:44.379> refine<00:03:44.739> his<00:03:44.919> skills<00:03:44.979> too<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.419> think

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
to refine his skills too and I think

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.899 
to refine his skills too and I think
motivation<00:03:47.379> plays<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> factor<00:03:47.979> in<00:03:48.250> injuries<00:03:48.699> so

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
motivation plays a factor in injuries so

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.059 
motivation plays a factor in injuries so
it<00:03:49.209> all<00:03:49.359> goes<00:03:49.540> together<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.079> think<00:03:50.319> maybe

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
it all goes together but I think maybe

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.129 
it all goes together but I think maybe
Pat<00:03:51.459> Riley's<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.849> little<00:03:52.299> fire<00:03:52.540> under<00:03:52.569> his<00:03:52.959> ass

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
Pat Riley's a little fire under his ass

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.229 
Pat Riley's a little fire under his ass
which<00:03:53.829> would<00:03:54.040> be<00:03:54.069> scary<00:03:54.519> for<00:03:54.609> someone<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.120> lot

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
which would be scary for someone a lot

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.460 
which would be scary for someone a lot
of<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.419> other<00:03:55.540> team's<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.989> league<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.349> you

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
of the other team's the league like you

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.490 
of the other team's the league like you
already<00:03:56.709> said<00:03:56.949> but<00:03:57.909> uh<00:03:57.970> yeah<00:03:58.720> nobody<00:03:59.260> there's

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
already said but uh yeah nobody there's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.740 
already said but uh yeah nobody there's
nobody<00:03:59.560> else<00:03:59.889> better<00:04:00.340> there's<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.329> a<00:04:01.389> better

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
nobody else better there's not a better

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.939 
nobody else better there's not a better
trainer<00:04:02.169> out<00:04:02.500> there<00:04:02.799> so<00:04:03.069> I<00:04:03.340> mean<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:05.319> know<00:04:05.409> if

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.219 
trainer out there so I mean you know if
for<00:04:06.190> some<00:04:06.220> reason<00:04:06.400> Tim<00:04:07.329> Grover<00:04:07.720> doesn't

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
for some reason Tim Grover doesn't

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.439 
for some reason Tim Grover doesn't
change<00:04:08.620> Wade<00:04:08.979> nobody<00:04:09.430> else's<00:04:09.879> but<00:04:10.120> I'm<00:04:10.239> pretty

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
change Wade nobody else's but I'm pretty

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.020 
change Wade nobody else's but I'm pretty
I'm<00:04:10.690> it's<00:04:11.229> like<00:04:11.379> a<00:04:11.409> it's<00:04:11.799> very<00:04:12.579> likely<00:04:12.849> that

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
I'm it's like a it's very likely that

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.460 
I'm it's like a it's very likely that
Duane<00:04:13.359> will<00:04:13.540> probably<00:04:13.959> come<00:04:14.079> back<00:04:14.229> pretty

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
Duane will probably come back pretty

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.869 
Duane will probably come back pretty
strongly<00:04:14.769> next<00:04:15.099> you're<00:04:15.310> working<00:04:15.549> with<00:04:15.639> go

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
strongly next you're working with go

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.710 
strongly next you're working with go
over<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.329> well<00:04:16.949> that<00:04:17.949> happens<00:04:18.430> yeah<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.299> I

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
over so well that happens yeah and I

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.390 
over so well that happens yeah and I
think<00:04:19.989> one<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.500> biggest<00:04:20.709> reasons<00:04:21.159> you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
think one of the biggest reasons you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.879 
think one of the biggest reasons you
alluded<00:04:21.969> to<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:23.080> join<00:04:23.349> we'd<00:04:23.590> would<00:04:23.680> need

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
alluded to it that join we'd would need

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.969 
alluded to it that join we'd would need
to<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:25.150> know<00:04:25.240> get<00:04:25.719> a<00:04:25.779> little<00:04:26.080> more<00:04:26.229> lean<00:04:26.590> and

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
to you know get a little more lean and

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.060 
to you know get a little more lean and
trim<00:04:27.490> down

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
trim down

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.500 
trim down
a<00:04:28.160> little<00:04:28.490> bit<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.970> take<00:04:29.150> some<00:04:29.390> of<00:04:29.420> that

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
a little bit is to take some of that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.500 
a little bit is to take some of that
pressure<00:04:29.720> off<00:04:30.080> those<00:04:30.320> knee<00:04:30.890> joints<00:04:31.510> biggest

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510
