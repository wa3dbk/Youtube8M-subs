00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.130
 nice competition and it started very 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.640
 strong in this series xiii with already a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.339
 big opposition to the screen is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.000
 someone a number look this is the 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.980
 loose and that's worth us 1 ton 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 the amplitude and the extent of the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.699
 difficulty of this maneuver 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 but at this game of the most beautiful maneuvers 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.140

 start it started a little bit more 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.550
 gently than the previous series 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 until the Brazilian recalls 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.250
 tech what's on the screen that was in 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.260
 be careful of them wave one to 9 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 points 17 one to eight points 23 thanks to 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.760
 maneuvers like that with the magnifying glass 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 tail hype perfectly mastered for the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.810
 Brazilian and he flies to the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.170
 victory and qualification to the next 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170
 tower 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.460
 see these life style a little we get 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.050
 prepare in wax we take the shower with 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.710
 the marshall pitch and we chained so 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.650
 with the series 15 with matt lewis the neo 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.570
 Zelander and two Americans and with it 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.280
 still a surfer who broke loose and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.470
 we'll find on this board 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.220
 ludivine in a few moments with 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.880
 peeters with an 8 43 there also the fate of 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.070
 high flight 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.620
 you have it on the screen the American one on it 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.989
 will find in a few minutes on this 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.709
 plateau rdse nothing sad to say this 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:22.220
 back in the wave with the magnifying glass and 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.110
 projection of two sheaves 8.43 and the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.030
 victory for the American last 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 series ah it was the 16 series again 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.040
 a French race in the person of 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 naming mignot and it's him who opened 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.410
 the debates 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.660
 it was very hard 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.810
 tight than in the previous series we 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.380
 missed a bit of a wave at mid-race 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.299
 but it's joshua afraid you have a 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.049
 the surfer's image of the barbados who 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.810
 prevailed in front of the French cocorico 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.120
 we have a French who has qualified 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.840
 named mignot it was hot stressful 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.760
 for the four surfers and that's it 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.630
 low-end spot that is all about 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.780
 made 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.730
 his promises 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.730
 I was wondering
