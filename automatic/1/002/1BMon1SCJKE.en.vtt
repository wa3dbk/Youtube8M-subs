professional lenses are getting now is a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
professional lenses are getting now is a
nano<00:01:35.070> crystal<00:01:35.700> coating<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
nano crystal coating and what this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300 
nano crystal coating and what this
basically<00:01:37.110> does<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.950> gonna<00:01:38.100> reduce

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
basically does is it's gonna reduce

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.590 
basically does is it's gonna reduce
flare<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.509> ghosting<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.799> image<00:01:41.600> now

then not really all that impressed with

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.770 
then not really all that impressed with

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the VR system in it it does help a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.280 
the VR system in it it does help a
little<00:02:58.900> bit<00:02:59.170> but<00:02:59.410> not<00:03:00.220> not<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.390> much<00:03:01.660> however

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
little bit but not not that much however

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.289

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
impressed with and I'm very glad to see

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.479 
impressed with and I'm very glad to see
that<00:03:07.480> Nikon<00:03:07.870> decided<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.739> put<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.310> their

that Nikon decided to put that in their

that Nikon decided to put that in their

new 72 20 millimeter lens and that

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.020 
new 72 20 millimeter lens and that
should<00:03:11.950> definitely<00:03:12.130> make<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.819> great

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
should definitely make the great

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.509 
should definitely make the great
improvement<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.900> lens<00:03:14.109> especially<00:03:14.739> at

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
improvement to the lens especially at

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.400 
improvement to the lens especially at
slower<00:03:15.790> shutter<00:03:15.880> speeds<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.600> low-light

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.729 
changes are in the body of course the
body<00:03:22.150> looks<00:03:22.389> completely<00:03:22.930> different<00:03:23.319> than

before<00:03:24.130> it's<00:03:24.880> actually<00:03:25.359> a<00:03:25.569> little<00:03:26.019> bit

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
before it's actually a little bit

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.479 
before it's actually a little bit
shorter<00:03:26.650> than<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:26.980> lens<00:03:27.250> right<00:03:27.370> here

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489

and<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.650> still<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:38.130> great<00:04:38.610> great<00:04:39.060> lens<00:04:39.419> my

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
and it's still a great great lens my

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.710 
and it's still a great great lens my
personal<00:04:40.979> opinion<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.639> if<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.150> already<00:04:42.180> own

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
personal opinion is if you already own

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.990 
personal opinion is if you already own
the<00:04:43.020> older<00:04:43.380> Nikon<00:04:43.740> Sonia<00:04:44.039> 200<00:04:44.460> millimeter<00:04:44.820> I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
the older Nikon Sonia 200 millimeter I

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.180 
the older Nikon Sonia 200 millimeter I
would<00:04:45.419> suggest<00:04:45.570> just<00:04:46.050> keeping<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.830> not

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
would suggest just keeping it and not

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.980 
would suggest just keeping it and not
selling<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.699> to<00:04:47.789> get<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.060> newer<00:04:48.270> version<00:04:48.780> for

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
selling it to get the newer version for

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.779 
selling it to get the newer version for
a<00:04:49.020> little<00:04:49.229> extra<00:04:49.470> sharpness<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.250> vo<00:04:50.430> -

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
a little extra sharpness and vo -

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.730 
a little extra sharpness and vo -
because<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.479> lens<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:52.080> already<00:04:52.530> pretty

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
because this lens is already pretty

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.219 
because this lens is already pretty
phenomenal<00:04:53.330> however<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.419> you<00:04:54.630> do<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:54.840> homes

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
phenomenal however if you do not homes

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.379 
phenomenal however if you do not homes
on<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.950> lens<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.430> would<00:04:56.850> probably<00:04:57.060> buy<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
on the lens I would probably buy the

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.870 
on the lens I would probably buy the
newer<00:04:57.810> version<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.770> lens<00:04:59.100> because<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.610> VR

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
newer version of the lens because the VR

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.909 
newer version of the lens because the VR

shutter<00:05:02.280> speeds<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.510> sharpness<00:05:03.840> also<00:05:04.710> is

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
shutter speeds and the sharpness also is

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.860
