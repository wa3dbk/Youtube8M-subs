00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:10.930
 what's up with everyone talking to them next and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.630
 some guys because today I bring you the best 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.390
 class to take the flag only then 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.800
 is that it is a model not very played I 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.750
 Personally , there was almost no 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.400
 player except when he says this 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.590
 gameplay that is the exam of justly 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.410
 right now it was a game I was pretty 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.990
 well catch the flag I defended quite 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.220
 and well, I liked it in general, so 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.810
 the boys, as you can see here 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.510
 he brought the flag and you can even see 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.850
 that they give 200 points for each loss that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.679
 do while behind the flag so 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.530
 some guys well now we start yes to 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.019
 for the class the first thing that there is 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.780
 do is the gusts of let's 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.239
 define them as you can see in the video 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.519
 I wore the wow that is fundamental to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.429
 know where the enemies are the bird of 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.739
 answer that basically because it's very 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.749
 very useful however you can also 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.999
 be super useful the guard nothing but 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.129
 good in my case I preferred the egg of 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.830
 answer book guys for the third 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.780
 streak as you can see are not gusts 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.300
 high because obviously it's not a way to 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.000
 game 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.310
 lend a lot to say letters 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.200
 high gusts so the support gusts 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.030
 to the low gusts are going to be super 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.830
 fundamentals so in the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.440
 sentinel can go great 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.240
 I provide enough use in the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.010
 game that I played and then I was 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.470
 wonder killed many defended my 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.560
 flag and even put a sentinel in 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.240
 let's say in the enemy base and then hit 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.280
 to kill so good guys for 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.410
 know if we're going to go through the class and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.230
 as you can see I was wearing the mms and 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.050
 truth is a weapon that was me really well 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.300
 since it goes both well and closely as 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.300
 from far away so one I recommend a 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.200
 Fuse that is your preference 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.360
 to put pro grip and charger and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.880
 good in high school practically not 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.920
 I put nothing because then game smoke 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.050
 where he said I did not lend 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.750
 too much use a secondary weapon but 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.460
 in advantage 1 fundamental vest 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.050
 bulletproof and it's basically because if 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.480
 you are in your glass you are in the base 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.460
 enemy you can throw a c4 or you can 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.319
 have a c4 even there when they say 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.079
 they took your flag because they detonate it 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.489
 so they do not kill you and others do not do 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.889
 you go in vain the other base then 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.099
 basically bulletproof vest for it 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:25.530
 and in advantage 1 we have to put weight 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.739
 light because it is fundamental to move 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.230
 super fast on lead 2 and let's say 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.450
 what most in fusion is scavenger and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.920
 advantage 3 here is something super super 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.599
 fundamental in this game mode is 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.730
 extreme condition because it is a way of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.340
 game where you spend it running but 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.319
 we go the whole game of the note in what 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.719
 that I was playing to take the flag in 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.329
 lethal let's get 4 fundamental and it's 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.930
 what is best for me personally is 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.389
 the lethal team that better and in tactics 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.549
 This chair depends on you can use 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.430
 tactical insertion however you can 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.639
 go super super well the pomegranate of pm by 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.919
 if they put you some guardian or some 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.500
 center or some let's say this of 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.659
 switchboards that are placed and even in 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.760
 the game I played because they put me 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.219
 two in the enemy base so with a 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.139
 granada pm destroy the two and I went with 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.710
 the flag very happy life so 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.050
 well guys this is basically everything 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.060
 I do not know if they have any suggestions what 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.580
 they would change him but well I say it is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.590
 something pretty good a class very very 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.390
 adequate to this game mode so 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.670
 please vote the video with I like 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.610

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.610
