00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.880
 rotors carry 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.260
 very good everyone I am one more day with 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.970
 you to enjoy to pass it to me 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.070
 well because you always pass it to me 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 big and it is that two weeks ago as 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 You saw the broken since 5.13 so 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.330
 I told you that if you liked that if in a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.220
 series that had attention for people 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.290
 that I really liked I would follow 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.450
 doing so good yesterday has already 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.510
 I say oh my god how I'm ulises like 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.030
 I'm last week the 5.14 came out 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
 Well let's see a little bit this 5.14 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.050
 as affected to the goal what changes 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.149
 we have and also as more affected in 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.800
 general let's quickly review me 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.809
 I jump to champions that I think have not 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.179
 had enough impact and I refer 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.679
 to certain reasons first let's talk about 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.499
 champions game plan camps land was 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.030
 totally rigor created for me the rigor 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.499
 of game plan has been very good 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.659
 it seems that the pairs bring something very 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.829
 positive but it's too easy for you 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.879
 break the barrel before you 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.069
 can explode to make a good 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.929
 chain of achievement so if not 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.819
 you have a special surprise factor not 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.649
 you get a lot the evolution of the 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.420
 definitive is not bad but it is also 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.960
 complicated to have can you get the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.240
 easy but 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.070
 how complicated it is to get them with 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.710
 The benefit it gives you does not end 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 worth it so it's not bad game 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.619
 plan but I do not think it's one of the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.540
 top top lines of the moment 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.580
 I finish to fit it jump and I go 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.380
 know towards the said that it was broken 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.790
 broken broken but not broken from the positive 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 but that it was commissioned 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.140
 key put in the trunk I still have the same 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.430
 opinion is more if you look at the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.649
 profiles of the great players of 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.320
 do they have stopped playing it they have 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.640
 left totally obsolete and there's only 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.710
 some brave one who works get it out 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.690
 how is mini duke minedu that took it out 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.369
 with a very much like what he did 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.560
 with oriana with crush in this case 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.090
 power or football playing good with a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.039
 combination of items that did not work 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 nothing bad had a good effect is more my 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.490
 duke trusts him so much to see 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.020
 if you finish showing us that wil is 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.060
 totally effective for someone else 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.380
 be encouraged in the competition and give us a 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.910
 surprise with this action for the moment 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.909
 I still leave a little in the post Amen 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.679
 we jump we carry with rise rice 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.990
 Well, I think it 's the same as I said 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.000
 in the patch is in the well of the early 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.860
 game from a thousand day who when 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.019
 get the items you still have the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.179
 same effectiveness but it has a point 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.909
 negative 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.079
 before it was easy to keep the charges 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.150
 for 10 seconds to search 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.159
 initiations with crumb 2 in beats now 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.019
 you have to be much more decisive now 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.359
 is if you have the charges has to be the 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.859
 right time to act are a lot 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.450
 less seconds to react in this 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.280
 moment that the four remain 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.829
 loads before getting the fifth and 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.939
 they go into combat so well then 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.920
 a little more skill needed 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.269
 to play with rise and I think it's a 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.129
 character that is still totally 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.689
 useful that we can see it for fights of 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.239
 late game that has a long year held 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.829
 but that now is much more difficult 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.480
 get to that point where 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.400
 it really stands out again like the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.919
 rise earlier than in late burst to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 but you'll get to him and we'll see maybe 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.829
 in competition yes they follow us 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.349
 surprising with him but what is that 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.700
 what I think disappears for 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.159
 talk about the next two champions 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.049
 I refer to an item the needle room and here 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.230
 I said that it had completely broken 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.819
 that disappeared from the game error lie 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.019
 the truth is that until after 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.849
 try it has not been able to assess it 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.980
 correctly and it's more many games of 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.959
 competition like they can be amazing a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.909
 clear example of origin the some with 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.130
 most of the time European like lou le 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.930
 examine peeked at those lists 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.570
 is giving use but only gan with two 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.250
 nesting champions and on the one hand the fact 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.140
 of having the rune needle makes it much easier 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 cleaning this character if by 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.440
 yes you have many you and a lot of endurance and 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 is able to easily change the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.650
 made of using the roneeka needle with 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.180
 this new bus that you have given in which 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.100
 has a better cleaning in the jungle 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.870
 because it facilitates so that it can arrive 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.970
 better to the ganglia and that forms more 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.620
 fast trying to match up a bit 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.480
 with those who use the devourer and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.950
 also nest and is a good character for 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.660
 do jungle counter to go for these 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.310
 characters that are devourer where 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.470
 invades them if you leave them a little bit outside 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.630
 so they bid up very worth ica with 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.890
 nesting and working very well maybe 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.600
 lose a little more impact on the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.860
 early game because it does not have the same damage 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.600
 what was done before in area is high such 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.040
 but you do not notice much difference to a 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.420
 level and of the late who to accompany 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.010
 characters of little half follows 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.390
 working very well and to combine it 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.340
 with a trista with healing and shooting the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.990
 objective remains a brutality like that 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.420
 that in the ali with if it was not tested 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.040
 we jump and we go with him and elise the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.660
 character that with his modifications 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.760
 the changes in the stud has made 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.230
 come back completely and it's that before we have 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.000
 to raise the stop a little so that it was 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.190
 really useful now since the first 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.650
 level of this is already very 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.380
 forceful is brutal so the is 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.990
 come back with great force 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.460
 two options one is the mole of ash 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.340
 as we could also see in competitive 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.960
 last week playing one on one 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.230
 occasion and the other is with the needle 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.520
 roneeka turning afterwards like a tank 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.380
 Both work, I like the one in the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.820
 re unique needle because if the same thing 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.990
 than the past level and has a lot of support 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.250
 Holds very well thanks to the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.530
 generation that has will do with the passive 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.450
 of the definitive one instead of with the w in 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.530
 the cleanliness were also good but 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.970
 now you also add the damage of 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.800
 single hole in area to clean more 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.660
 quickly the camps and reach 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.930
 it becomes good to tell jungle 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.120
 une return safe 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.020
 sure it 's very good to also do 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.760
 Some others that I like 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.380
 you always go and two of character and also 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.210
 with the improvement in this it becomes even 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.560
 better with goals as important as 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.450
 the birth of the dragon has always been the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.560
 key to get it quickly like this 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.180
 that you can not ask for more from this 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.810
 Ellis character that comes back and shape 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.620
 forceful point of this because 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.530
 remember that the next time 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.900
 we will see the 5.14 in competition will be the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.030
 playoff days 8 and 9 where they will play the 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.140
 Giants game and h2 here and there are two 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.760
 There are players who use it very well 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.560
 what flex has always been your mail 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.940
 Alice and on the other hand we also 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.800
 we found with fredrik that he used it 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.340
 very much so two players that 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.860
 before 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.419
 lc s used many 'champion n times 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.220
 and they have also played with him and that 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.690
 possibly they will and will fight for him 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.900
 if they were not in this champion 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.160
 in the quarterfinals of the playoff 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.500
 following with the line of the items was 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.940
 aldo since I for me was a better 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.530
 absolute an idem that had to sound 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.370
 enough but people have dared us to 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.680
 remove it 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.080
 I tried it is not bad the only thing 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.880
 did not finish finding him maybe that 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.199
 point as strong as it gets 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.150
 find easily with other items 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.800
 so that's why maybe they do not end 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.270
 to go out in competition we will wait for 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.620
 see without competition they take it out so that the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.240
 people are encouraged more to play us as 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.160
 always save a subsidiary to the whole world 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.950
 plays cillian this works like this is not going to 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.690
 sell never and finally the timers I've 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.570
 created a lot of dispute with these and if I've 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.070
 created a lot of dispute I continue 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.810
 saying the same thing to me the goalkeeper 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.180
 also dragon and the biggest has been a 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.100
 mistake I do not like it and there will be people who 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.139
 you will not like it but respect you have things 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.970
 positive and has bad things now for 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.410
 example is not a goal that you know 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.670
