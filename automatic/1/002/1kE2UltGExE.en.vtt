00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
anywhere from 16 to 20 hours if you had

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.840 
anywhere from 16 to 20 hours if you had
a<00:03:35.580> smaller<00:03:35.880> roast<00:03:36.590> closer<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.950> 5<00:03:38.160> pound<00:03:38.700> or

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
a smaller roast closer to the 5 pound or

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.780 
a smaller roast closer to the 5 pound or
less<00:03:39.560> 2.3<00:03:40.560> kilos<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.100> probably<00:03:41.489> could<00:03:41.640> go

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
less 2.3 kilos you probably could go

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.030 
less 2.3 kilos you probably could go
closer<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.209> 16<00:03:42.600> if<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.050> maybe<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.380> 6<00:03:43.620> pounder

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
closer to 16 if it's maybe a 6 pounder

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.960 
closer to 16 if it's maybe a 6 pounder
2.7<00:03:44.670> kilos<00:03:44.940> closer<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:46.320> 18<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:46.890> really<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.340> as

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
2.7 kilos closer to 18 but really it as

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.400 
2.7 kilos closer to 18 but really it as
long<00:03:48.150> as<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.420> tender<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.780> shreds<00:03:49.140> apart

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
long as it's tender and shreds apart

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.390 
long as it's tender and shreds apart
easily<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.980> done<00:03:51.860> okay<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.100> has<00:03:53.220> been

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
easily it's done okay so this has been

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.720 
easily it's done okay so this has been
going<00:03:53.610> for<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.970> over<00:03:54.120> 17<00:03:54.810> hours<00:03:55.730> which

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
going for just over 17 hours which

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.520 
going for just over 17 hours which
should<00:03:56.760> be<00:03:56.970> plenty<00:03:57.180> anywhere<00:03:57.630> from<00:03:57.780> 16<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.200> 20

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
should be plenty anywhere from 16 to 20

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.289 
should be plenty anywhere from 16 to 20
would<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.680> fine<00:03:58.980> I'm<00:03:59.790> just<00:03:59.970> going<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.150> turn

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
you can see there's plenty of liquid in

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.750 
you can see there's plenty of liquid in

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
separate container for shredding I don't

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.479 
separate container for shredding I don't
just<00:04:12.140> put<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.379> right<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.890> liquid<00:04:13.190> just<00:04:13.340> in
