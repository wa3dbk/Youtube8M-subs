I am now in Minecraft 1.8 point 4 and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.080 
I am now in Minecraft 1.8 point 4 and
you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> probably<00:01:01.590> tell<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.370> difference<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you can probably tell the difference and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
you can probably tell the difference and
the<00:01:03.510> problem<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.260> check<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> right

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the problem if you check on the right

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
the problem if you check on the right
hand<00:01:05.369> side<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> screen<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.960> unique

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740

identifier for this armorstand has been

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
identifier for this armorstand has been
cut<00:01:10.320> off<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> check<00:01:12.060> for

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
cut off so if I would like to check for

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.990 
cut off so if I would like to check for
this<00:01:12.960> armorstands<00:01:13.920> score<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> scoreboard

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this armorstands score in the scoreboard

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
this armorstands score in the scoreboard
I<00:01:15.119> would<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> wrong<00:01:15.600> results<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I would get the wrong results so I can

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.179 
I would get the wrong results so I can
even<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> score<00:01:17.009> board<00:01:17.689> players<00:01:18.689> add<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.830> II

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
even the score board players add that II

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.490 
even the score board players add that II
type<00:01:20.610> equals<00:01:21.000> armors<00:01:22.130> understand<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:24.080> 1<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.380> if

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
type equals armors understand a 1 so if

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.670 
type equals armors understand a 1 so if
I<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.740> add<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.640> armor<00:01:26.970> sin<00:01:27.150> score

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
I just add one to this armor sin score

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
I just add one to this armor sin score
we<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.070> second<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> same

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we get a second one it's not the same

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.179 
we get a second one it's not the same
one<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.619> command<00:01:35.070> block

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
one so if we had a command block

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
one so if we had a command block
contraption<00:01:36.090> which<00:01:36.659> requires<00:01:37.079> scoreboards

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
