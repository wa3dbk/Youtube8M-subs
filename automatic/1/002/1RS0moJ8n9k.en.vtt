00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.869
 very good everyone here sergio 49 in a 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.570
 new video where I teach you my first 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.270
 a boxing is about an order I made 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.250
 about three weeks ago right now to a 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.439
 company called ccs or competitive 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.950
 control spain and they have brought it to me 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.640
 from this past Friday, day 16 of 3 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.370
 of 2013 as you can see is a small box 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.350
 where I will show you what it contains but 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.180
 I do not turn around since they are my 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 data behind so let's go with the 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.280
 content 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.590
 inside the box there is a paper where they give 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.590
 all the data to contact them 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.870
 and I had to take everything that came 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.640
 since you open the box with one hand and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.150
 hold the mobile recording as it is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.000
 a little bit difficult 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.920
 well here you have the bubble paper 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.210
 which is to protect the content in the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.640
 trip 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.890
 On the other hand you have a little paper 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.840
 that goes to the sides good inside the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.030
 box to also protect it after 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.010
 you have a key that serves to regulate 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.130
 to your liking the triggers of the command 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.860
 competitive then you have two 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 letters where you put again the data of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.400
 the company and behind have a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.630
 calendar so therefore it's very 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.560
 Useful 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 and finally you have the manual of the command 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.960
 where it comes to you whenever you buy a 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.240
 xbox 360 command 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.210
 In short this company what it does is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 sell equipment 360 and play 3 commands to 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.369
 an economic price comparing it less 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.170
 comparing it with other companies also 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.330
 when you buy a remote you can 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.070
 customize it to your liking as I 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.610
 I've done with mine that I'm going to teach 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.610
 right now 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 and well here you have my command 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.960
 personalized that as you can see it takes 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 I am that left of the team if 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 the right of play 3 also carries a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.250
 epic camouflage you are green and black and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.399
 my gamer such if you look well written 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.140
 on the left of the command the black is a 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.470
 control with cable because the batteries 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.690
 rechargeable or are not the truth is that a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.810
 great start 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.240
 on the back of the remote it carries the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.260
 lever that are two buttons that make the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.260
 same function as the equipment key or 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 the X and the circle of the play 3 that 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.930
 provides a little more speed to the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.300
 time to play then take the joystick 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.820
 and the other buttons except the crosshead 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.770
 yellow color in the castles of 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.690
 command carries some stops that what they do 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.220
 is that you do not have to lower the trigger 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.350
 down and that therefore 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.250
 provides more speed when it comes to 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.880
 to play 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.010
 and good to conclude commenting that the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.800
 control colors and all that I've 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.140
 purposely chosen to make it a bit 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.870
 weird at the time of seeing it and also 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.910
 tell you that from here I will return to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.860
 upload again videos and also to 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.140
 apply them in some of them the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.930
 absence on youtube I've had and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.020
 others so guys I say goodbye 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.020
 and favorites if you liked it and goodbye 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.230
 and I am
