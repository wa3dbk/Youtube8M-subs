00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
food in here and then the lynches tongue

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.110 
food in here and then the lynches tongue
goes<00:04:01.590> right<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.040> very<00:04:02.310> easily<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:02.820> yeah

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
goes right on very easily I think yeah
