00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.120
 Good 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.340
 Ha ha ha ha 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.510
 That's that 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.140
 high who 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.140
 Please put buono kerosene 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.570
 I think but No. 2 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:37.560
 Well- during my lessons I often advise on ball disease, but it is 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 The distance between the body and the ball is actually an important factor in order not to break the swing 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.000
 That ball it means Nai' in its orbit to have a good swing at was signal 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.380
 Suppose it happened 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.270
 Then the player does the feeling that the ec brother is not the ball 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.550
 It means that I have to strike 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.140
 So for example, here in the goal there were three 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.100
 In a 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.240
 Let's say that all three of them 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.530
 Then it is what that not stable after all the Tteyuu the person's swing 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.610
 When this three balls is how to get off the thing Tsu Chau Te all of the only change once a time when there 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.159
 It's such to say 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:22.549
 So when you have the best swing among them you have to be at a certain place 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.999
 It is golf to put the ball on the way that the club passes 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:31.869
 So my usual advice is that the ball is a little bit more or less close 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:37.369
 The sound is often said that the advice is because there is no ball on the path of the person 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.270
 Now that the person is in good bedding and the ball 1 work can be reworked so it's easy 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.150
 Even though I 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.159
 That this time 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.749
 Huh 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.549
 When it changes to the position of a good ball to some extent and it becomes unbeatable , the fall of the Honda swing 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:52.310
 It means that I have to 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:55.980
 It is very important these days, but put a ball on the path of a good swing and practice 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.870
 I think that is very important 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.240
 It is said that you should not be delighted with shots that the ball does not hit Oita in different places 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.990
 It's going to be a matter 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.540
 a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.840
 Rin that did not go out swing to sleep distance 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.470
 Because it happens that it is not straight and thin 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.390
 This is a golf course with a good swing path 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.690
 Unique a 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 It is the way, but for example to silk pitcher 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.700
 The head speed is the fastest here, so if you say that you should buy and throw it 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.970
 I will not give you 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.910
 But I tend to play golf If I change my standing position 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.740
 The position of the water ball can be adjusted freely, so a good swing can be made and that day 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 With the idea of ​​putting a ball 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.069
 a 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.219
 Is that setup when you set a very ball Order from 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.519
 I think you understand that it's very important 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:52.560
 So even if you watch a professional golfer's TV game 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:55.530
 The procedure for setting up is completely the same, saying that the irrigation water always comes from the stand at the same distance 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.329
 And setup of the 窯 entry at that time 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.090
 I'm doing it very politely You can put the ball somewhere else 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.980
 After swing 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.269
 Because not also at the moment hit the different places the ball is that the swing collapses 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.510
 It will happen 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:16.189
 So when you also that you practice in mind the place of there 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.000
 That at the time of the ball house is not exposed to the difference between whether the swing is the difference whether that is divided Kichitto 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.110
 I want you to do it 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 Even if it is a good swing, the all character is different or I do n't know, but the swing is good 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:30.260
 But the position of the finish is wrong from the position of the toilet 3 top which does not always hit 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.530
 Does it mean not that I'd check over there in the wind a previously First waited in front of 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.350
 Ball ball 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.120
 Just check the distance Please check the way a 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.050
 Their checks much the introduction maintenance at the time of shook me Na I want to send something like 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.500
 You should just look 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.560
 You can do it by putting the ball in that position 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.060
 This is a simple check method of 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.880
 There is also a check method from scratch, which swung down I 1 you turn the body 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:02.480
 While using it so kind of Nogata 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:06.980
 Please try to practice in the always constant and Puchi' the leave of his toe and ball 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:13.240
 If you do so then the position of the top or pc person will rotate your body 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.240
 As I think that's the case, I carefully practice that place and practice
