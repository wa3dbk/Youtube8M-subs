00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.229
 hello everyone here the churqui is we're 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.910
 in a new gta 5 video online and today 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.339
 I bring you a very cool trick very 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.500
 interesting and very curious how to enter 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:14.349
 in the house of michael be in the interior 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.759
 ok it's something the truth that to me 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.519
 it astonishes a little because it is a bliss 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.920
 So simple that you say how the fuck has 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.269
 past this I know now you will see it and the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.689
 true that it is very simple simply 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.460
 need the help of a friend of someone 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.900
 that you have in the online and you understand 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.380
 because the guiris are sometimes very 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.570
 bastards 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.330
 but good, they need someone's help 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.980
 and that that someone caught his car is worth and 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.150
 as I'm seeing now in the video I've 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 done what we have to do things your 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.040
 car we ride with him and he has to 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.740
 do it accelerates against the corner of the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.410
 maikel garage is worth as you see there is 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.700
 recording and there corner with the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.530
 for about five seconds with the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.150
 corner of the garage good when we do 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.150
 this is as simple as that as 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.950
 when we do this we go out in 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.270
 we just need a friend but I 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.060
 I was here with another that the visor 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.420
 subscriber and I got in the car with 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.530
 another subscriber and this one killed me 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.930
 that is, he does not have to kill me and the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.390
 car to the owner of the car and reappear 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.090
 we have close to michael's house and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 we will have to approach quickly to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.009
 the house of michael and surprisingly 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.200
 seriously surprisingly we 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.030
 we found how you are seeing there the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.830
 garage door open I stayed 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.259
 fuck it's true that it works because 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.500
 I saw this trick and I say this is a fake 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.140
 that you shit but it is not incredible the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.670
 truth I kept saying lol I can 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.450
 enter to see what is inside that opens 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.610
 will be the family of michael that bravo 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.670
 there will be people, no, I do not know, no 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.679
 you see in a house of nobody in gta online 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.149
 but well there you see the other 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.429
 nano subscriber could not enter not be 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.250
 the door was closed but then if 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.170
 We put a car we ride and put 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.729
 the garage in the garage with him inside the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.860
 car yes you can enter but good 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.610
 as you are seeing now it is all 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.000
 identical to how in campaign mode the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.190
 michael's house here I got to see if yes 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.140
 there would be some door or something but the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.609
 truth that nothing is opened is like 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.410
 everything closed and good as you see here the 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.989
 lounge I thought I could interact 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.250
 with the TV but in the end I could not 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.079
 interacting with her seems to not be 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.209
 can interact with that in particular 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.109
 because now we will see that yes you can 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.959
 interact for example with the 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.989
 computer above the child's house 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.269
 jimmy ie as you see here now 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.890
 he entered the room there is no one 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.359
 there is simply a mirror that you can 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 look to make yourself a little picture 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.980
 tuenti but good is simply this what 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.750
 what's in this room there's nothing in the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.329
 house is simply that it is very curious 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.069
 it's not being in a michael house in the 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.500
 fucking online and the truth that that then I 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.190
 it seemed very cool the truth is good 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.750
 as here 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.310
 the first thing that came to my mind I say to see 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.600
 if I can smoke the pipe but not 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.280
 you can not smoke the pipe simply 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.190
 as you can see there can interact with the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.780
 jimmy laptop and nothing else 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.270
 can not play or play and I do not 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.790
 Can I smoke 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.320
 the pipe of peace but good here now 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.050
 As you can see inside my room, I say that if 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.360
 Find me michael here and with the woman 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.330
 or something there is nothing I say to see if here I 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.650
 he gives his clothes nothing is already all the same 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.030
 in campaign mode and there is no one no 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.530
 it seems that in this house for now 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.730
 nobody lives and the truth that is very 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.110
 curious here I said yes to see if it 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.430
 I could kill through that window 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.110
 truth is that I know with the franc 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.380
 then you can mark a little girl like that 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.740
 I know that the old uefa like pussy 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.230
 has killed but good the truth that a 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.050
 through the glass now I'm going to check 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.069
 you can not kill anyone as you see 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.590
 now I told 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.629
 to my subscriber to be put on the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.760
 source from outside to see if with a 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.200
 fran sauce because it could burst the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.440
 skull but apparently not 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.599
 do not go through this window as you see 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.510
 It's a cliché and as you can see, it does not die 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.650
 window is armored is the house of 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.709
 michael who gets into many problems 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.629
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.760
 true that a very curious gray and you can 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.340
 mess it up here you can get in here and I 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.930
 I know 10 people 8 and good is the only 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.200
 way out again with the garage and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.329
 something very curious that I thought was this 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.180
 ball is that with this ball we can 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.880
 do many things like for example the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.919
 pomme ball or the ball bomb that is 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.479
 get 4 in this ball take it out 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.240
 because you can take it out even though the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.240
 others do not see the others or in the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.160
 people do not see it the ball I took it 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.720
 does outside and told me that ball I do not know what 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.330
 I say that I can see the ball myself and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.550
 others can not do a hype the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.440
 invisible , you can play with this 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.780
 also so good I thought 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.760
 interesting I found it very curious and 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.320
 I hope that you too, so 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.330
 well I hope you liked a layún 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.590
 favorite would help a lot and see you 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.540
 to the next 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.689
 goodbye
