00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.980 

okay<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:02.040> let's<00:00:02.340> get<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.580> electronics<00:00:03.179> so<00:00:03.780> we

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay so let's get to electronics so we

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.110 
okay so let's get to electronics so we
have<00:00:04.520> ripped<00:00:05.520> forward<00:00:05.970> inside<00:00:06.240> here<00:00:11.090> we<00:00:12.090> have

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
have ripped forward inside here we have

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.269 
have ripped forward inside here we have
-<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:18.740> inside<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> ramp<00:00:20.010> sport

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
- you can see inside the ramp sport

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.480 
- you can see inside the ramp sport
there's<00:00:20.490> jumpers<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.740> jumpers<00:00:23.100> control

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
there's jumpers so the jumpers control

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
there's jumpers so the jumpers control
how<00:00:23.820> many<00:00:24.119> steps<00:00:26.990> to<00:00:27.990> turn<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> motor<00:00:30.349> for

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
how many steps to turn the motor for

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.799 
how many steps to turn the motor for
every<00:00:31.500> pull<00:00:31.710> services<00:00:33.200> so<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.980> board<00:00:35.160> has

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
every pull services so the board has

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.610 
every pull services so the board has
five<00:00:38.120> steppers<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.600> meta<00:00:39.780> stepper<00:00:40.110> drivers

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
five steppers these meta stepper drivers

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
five steppers these meta stepper drivers
so<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:41.700> eventually<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so these are eventually going to go in

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.690 
so these are eventually going to go in
here<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.680> fits<00:00:43.890> five<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.550> only

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
here it fits five of them but you only

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940 
here it fits five of them but you only
need<00:00:44.850> four<00:00:45.200> if<00:00:46.200> you're<00:00:46.350> doing<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.620> two-color

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
need four if you're doing a two-color

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.450 
need four if you're doing a two-color
system<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:47.789> use<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> fifth<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
system then use the fifth but we have to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970 
system then use the fifth but we have to
put<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> jumpers<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.410> tell<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
put the jumpers in there to tell it to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.840 
put the jumpers in there to tell it to
do<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.719> sixteenth<00:00:55.170> stepping<00:00:55.730> there's<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
do like one sixteenth stepping there's a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.810 
do like one sixteenth stepping there's a
quarter<00:00:57.210> step<00:00:57.420> bang<00:00:57.690> -<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.440> bang

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.479 

but<00:01:02.420> instead<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.500> each<00:01:03.590> of<00:01:04.070> these<00:01:04.220> blocks

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
but instead of each of these blocks

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.850 
but instead of each of these blocks
there's<00:01:05.059> three<00:01:05.540> sets<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.990> pins<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.680> just

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
there's three sets of pins and you just

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.160 
there's three sets of pins and you just
need<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.040> close<00:01:07.370> all<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.760> pins<00:01:10.630> okay<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:11.810> those

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
need to close all the pins okay so those

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.710 
need to close all the pins okay so those
are<00:01:12.350> set<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:12.740> now<00:01:12.950> we<00:01:13.010> have<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.430> prep<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
are set so now we have to prep the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.330 
are set so now we have to prep the
stepper<00:01:15.080> boards<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:17.920> actually<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.220> to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
stepper boards and actually I like to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.090 
stepper boards and actually I like to
put<00:01:19.520> these<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:21.020> RAM<00:01:21.170> support<00:01:21.530> first<00:01:21.830> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
put these on the RAM support first and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:37.690 
put these on the RAM support first and
then<00:01:22.310> stick<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.640> eat<00:01:22.850> sink

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.550 

okay<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.740> orders

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
okay so orders

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.359 
okay so orders
they'll<00:01:43.130> plug<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:43.670> right<00:01:44.180> above<00:01:44.479> them<00:01:45.369> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
they'll plug in right above them the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.480 
they'll plug in right above them the
temperature<00:01:46.970> sensors<00:01:47.950> are<00:01:48.950> right<00:01:49.159> above<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
temperature sensors are right above the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.050 
temperature sensors are right above the
Z<00:01:49.640> motor<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:51.979> just<00:01:52.220> use<00:01:52.430> one<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.880> ours<00:01:55.060> so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
Z motor and we just use one of ours so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.580 
Z motor and we just use one of ours so
this<00:01:56.210> guy<00:01:56.360> will<00:01:56.420> just<00:01:56.630> be<00:01:56.960> connected<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
this guy will just be connected to the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.930 
this guy will just be connected to the
first<00:01:57.890> set<00:01:58.159> of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.940 

there<00:02:01.570> mr.<00:02:01.870> connections<00:02:02.350> it's<00:02:02.500> labeled<00:02:02.830> T

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
there mr. connections it's labeled T

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.520 
there mr. connections it's labeled T
zero<00:02:03.600> all<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.810> our<00:02:04.930> switches<00:02:07.410> are<00:02:08.410> connected

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
zero all of our switches are connected

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.460 
zero all of our switches are connected
up<00:02:08.920> here<00:02:09.160> there's<00:02:09.430> three<00:02:10.060> pins<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:11.290> we'll

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
up here there's three pins but we'll

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.610 
up here there's three pins but we'll
just<00:02:11.500> use<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.070> top<00:02:12.310> two<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.570> they're<00:02:16.810> X<00:02:17.080> Y<00:02:17.320> Z

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
just use the top two and they're X Y Z

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.080 
just use the top two and they're X Y Z
and<00:02:18.390> then<00:02:20.040> there's<00:02:21.040> two<00:02:21.220> sets<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.700> two<00:02:21.760> sets

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
and then there's two sets so two sets

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.680 
and then there's two sets so two sets
for<00:02:22.180> X<00:02:22.360> 2<00:02:22.870> sets<00:02:23.080> for<00:02:23.260> y<00:02:23.410> 2<00:02:24.040> sets<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.400> Z<00:02:24.610> min<00:02:25.450> max

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
for X 2 sets for y 2 sets for Z min max

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.370 
for X 2 sets for y 2 sets for Z min max
at<00:02:25.990> X<00:02:26.230> min<00:02:26.920> x<00:02:27.220> max<00:02:27.340> Y<00:02:28.120> min<00:02:28.420> Y<00:02:28.930> max<00:02:29.200> Z<00:02:29.800> men<00:02:30.010> Z<00:02:30.280> max

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
at X min x max Y min Y max Z men Z max

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.020 
at X min x max Y min Y max Z men Z max
so<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.530> our<00:02:32.650> configuration<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
so in our configuration that we have a

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080 
so in our configuration that we have a
max<00:02:34.570> for<00:02:35.260> our<00:02:35.610> ax

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
max for our ax

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.430 
max for our ax
so<00:02:37.960> we'd<00:02:38.110> skip<00:02:38.380> them<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:39.010> plug<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.310> 2<00:02:39.430> max

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
so we'd skip them in and plug in 2 max

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.380 
so we'd skip them in and plug in 2 max
for<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.530> Y<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:42.040> wasn't<00:02:42.460> actually<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.790> min<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
for the Y that wasn't actually a min so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.850 
for the Y that wasn't actually a min so
we<00:02:43.780> need<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.020> connect<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.800> first

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
we need to connect right to that first

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.120 
we need to connect right to that first
one<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.760> then<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.630> Z<00:02:46.870> we're<00:02:47.380> at<00:02:47.500> max<00:02:47.770> so

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
one and then for the Z we're at max so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.100 
one and then for the Z we're at max so
you<00:02:48.190> skip<00:02:48.550> them<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.880> matok<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.810> gonna<00:02:49.930> be

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
you skip them in matok so it's gonna be

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.810 
you skip them in matok so it's gonna be
like<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.290> skip<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> set<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.190> pins<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.670> then

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
like a skip a set of pins and then

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.900 
like a skip a set of pins and then
connect<00:02:52.150> your<00:02:52.210> connector<00:02:52.830> then<00:02:53.830> give<00:02:54.490> two

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
connect your connector then give two

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.230 
connect your connector then give two
sets<00:02:55.210> of<00:02:55.300> pins<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:55.810> connector

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.460 

so<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:01.680> will<00:03:01.980> plug<00:03:02.460> this<00:03:02.580> into<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.880> Arduino

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
so we will plug this into the Arduino

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.920 
so we will plug this into the Arduino
this<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.830> be<00:03:04.950> very<00:03:05.190> difficult<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.120> sometimes

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
this can be very difficult and sometimes

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.270 
this can be very difficult and sometimes
these<00:03:08.540> leads<00:03:09.540> right<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.140> will<00:03:10.920> actually

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
these leads right here will actually

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.620 
these leads right here will actually
bump<00:03:11.820> onto<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.510> connector<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.830> typically

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
bump onto this connector so I typically

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.410 
bump onto this connector so I typically
trim<00:03:15.630> them<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> bit

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:32.630 

so<00:03:22.050> it's<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.560> two<00:03:22.710> metal<00:03:23.040> ones

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.250 

yeah

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.860 

okay<00:03:42.129> so<00:03:42.400> there's<00:03:42.790> some<00:03:43.030> screws<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:43.599> can<00:03:43.750> go

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
okay so there's some screws that can go

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.600 
okay so there's some screws that can go
through<00:03:44.050> there

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
through there

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.149 
through there
looks<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.390> we'll<00:03:46.599> just<00:03:46.870> use<00:03:47.260> two<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.709> em<00:03:48.010> I

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
looks like we'll just use two of em I

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:56.339 
looks like we'll just use two of em I
think<00:03:51.900> these<00:03:52.900> are<00:03:52.989> number<00:03:53.379> four<00:03:53.590> screws<00:03:55.349> so

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
think these are number four screws so

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.530 
think these are number four screws so
that<00:03:56.379> will<00:03:56.590> go<00:03:56.709> on<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.040> inside<00:03:57.340> wall<00:03:57.670> here<00:04:00.540> and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
that will go on the inside wall here and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:13.740 
that will go on the inside wall here and
then<00:04:02.200> we'll<00:04:02.349> also<00:04:02.440> have<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> power<00:04:03.069> supply

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.659 

you

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.670 

so<00:04:21.539> I've<00:04:21.629> got<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:21.989> place<00:04:22.409> so<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:25.020> can't

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
so I've got that in place so I can't

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.649 
so I've got that in place so I can't
hook<00:04:25.919> up<00:04:26.069> the<00:04:27.379> limit<00:04:28.379> switches<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:30.270> we<00:04:30.449> have

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
hook up the limit switches and we have

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:36.469 
hook up the limit switches and we have
the<00:04:31.560> temperature<00:04:32.099> sensor<00:04:34.819> we<00:04:35.819> can<00:04:35.999> move<00:04:36.120> to

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
the temperature sensor we can move to

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:45.510 
the temperature sensor we can move to
the<00:04:37.110> power<00:04:37.319> cords

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.670 

you

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.820 

so<00:04:50.680> next<00:04:51.460> we<00:04:51.700> can<00:04:51.910> do<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.660> motors<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.470> motor

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
so next we can do the motors the motor

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.170 
so next we can do the motors the motor
wires

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:27.370 

Oh

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.990 

okay<00:05:27.950> so<00:05:28.490> these<00:05:28.670> go<00:05:29.030> in<00:05:29.390> these<00:05:29.890> ten<00:05:30.890> two<00:05:31.760> top

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
okay so these go in these ten two top

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.559 
okay so these go in these ten two top
ones

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:43.199 

a<00:05:37.839> couple<00:05:38.839> of<00:05:38.899> wires<00:05:39.139> to<00:05:39.439> use<00:05:39.589> for<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:39.919> fan

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.209 

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:50.780 

just<00:05:44.209> put<00:05:44.449> some<00:05:44.629> electrical<00:05:45.469> tape<00:05:45.679> over<00:05:45.830> here

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:06:00.330 

don't<00:05:51.750> go<00:05:51.870> anywhere<00:05:52.560> touch<00:05:52.800> each<00:05:52.830> other

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.210 

so<00:06:01.340> here

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.000 

we<00:06:04.730> can<00:06:04.880> go<00:06:05.030> through<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.600> start<00:06:05.780> a<00:06:06.200> zip<00:06:06.800> tying

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
we can go through and start a zip tying

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.810 
we can go through and start a zip tying
these<00:06:07.670> wires<00:06:07.940> together<00:06:09.130> to<00:06:10.130> sort<00:06:10.460> of<00:06:10.520> clean<00:06:10.790> up

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
these wires together to sort of clean up

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.560 
these wires together to sort of clean up
all<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.420> mess<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:12.550> here<00:06:13.550> we<00:06:13.670> are<00:06:13.700> a<00:06:14.450> little

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
all the mess and here we are a little

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.930 
all the mess and here we are a little
bit<00:06:15.080> cleaned<00:06:15.350> up<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.920> still<00:06:16.340> has<00:06:16.490> a<00:06:16.520> lot<00:06:16.880> of

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
bit cleaned up it still has a lot of

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.180 
bit cleaned up it still has a lot of
improvements<00:06:17.600> to<00:06:17.720> make<00:06:17.900> but<00:06:18.230> they<00:06:19.010> should

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
improvements to make but they should

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.550 
improvements to make but they should
have<00:06:19.280> let<00:06:19.490> us<00:06:19.610> continue<00:06:20.480> without<00:06:20.780> like<00:06:20.990> making

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
have let us continue without like making

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.440 
have let us continue without like making
a<00:06:21.620> mess<00:06:21.770> of<00:06:21.890> everything

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
a mess of everything

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.440 
a mess of everything
so<00:06:23.450> I'll<00:06:23.750> Transpac<00:06:24.140> around
