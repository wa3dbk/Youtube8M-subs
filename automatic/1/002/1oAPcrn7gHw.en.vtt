colorway goes I really liked it and that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
colorway goes I really liked it and that
it<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> black<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> gold<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.930> never<00:01:25.110> go

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it is black and gold you can never go

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719 
it is black and gold you can never go
wrong<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.460> course<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
wrong with that and then of course you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
wrong with that and then of course you
have<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.390> white<00:01:27.600> accenting

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
have a little bit of white accenting

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.929 
have a little bit of white accenting
through<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> midsole<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> wish<00:01:29.610> they<00:01:29.759> would

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
through the midsole I wish they would

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.399 
through the midsole I wish they would
have<00:01:30.030> done<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> black<00:01:30.720> speckling<00:01:31.259> or

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
have done like a black speckling or

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.390 
have done like a black speckling or
something<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.369> really

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
something like that I think it really

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.429 
something like that I think it really
would<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.909> looked<00:01:33.509> good<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
would have looked good on this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.749 
would have looked good on this

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
screws and it's kind of difficult to see

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.390 
screws and it's kind of difficult to see
the<00:05:04.139> traction<00:05:04.560> pattern<00:05:04.740> because<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.160> is

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
the traction pattern because it is

in but basically you have this kind of

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.680 
in but basically you have this kind of
turf<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:11.100> friendly<00:05:11.729> pattern<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:12.389> you<00:05:12.510> will

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
turf a friendly pattern if you will

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.150

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.980 
where you have these little kind of
diamonds<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.820> then<00:05:14.910> these<00:05:15.060> little<00:05:15.270> kind<00:05:15.870> of

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
diamonds and then these little kind of

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.480 
diamonds and then these little kind of
picks<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.680> would<00:05:16.800> find<00:05:17.010> similar<00:05:17.370> to

Calvin Johnson's on feet with a pair of
pins<00:06:43.409> and<00:06:43.679> again<00:06:44.249> I<00:06:44.279> think<00:06:44.429> this<00:06:44.729> shoe<00:06:44.999> looks

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360

really<00:06:45.809> good

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
really good

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.589 
really good

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:51.059 
model I think that it comes in enough

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.609 
model I think that it comes in enough
color<00:06:51.300> ways<00:06:51.509> that<00:06:51.689> are<00:06:51.809> subtle<00:06:52.169> enough<00:06:52.439> to

00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:52.619
