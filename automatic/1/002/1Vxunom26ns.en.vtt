00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Let's do this the hard way. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 could hurt less come make me repeat 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 Time is not on your side. 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.500
 I should have walked away. I like to hit. 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.730
 You 're good to be at any time. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 reckless 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.070
 you never saw this coming which amy 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
 show a novelty welcome the reason 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.810
 I'll help you this time with gas. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.300
 My notices are over, that's how we say it. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 because of the last chance to be 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.019
 anywhere else will me 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.529
 provoking, it's old enough to buy 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.340
 that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.440
 angel I quit 10 is let the angel work 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 I'm going to take a break and I know that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.730
 I will not need it but I will take it. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 so even second chance 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.079
 I thought I was on the fifth some 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 things really get better with time. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 Dad, this trunk has a bright future. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.160
 sometimes aging has its good side 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 three forces together 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.110
 triple hat does not make my style more 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.309
 this one is angrily abandonment must have been 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 a very nice guy 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.010
 Bet my destiny well I'll buy 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.789
 This and who loses are you with nails and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.090
 teeth 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.250
 literally it is that it is then that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 Trick me it can not hide your 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 weaknesses of me I love to attack 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 pilots with their own toys by 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.610
 a weapon on a sword 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.040
 well, that's a freezing thing. 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.119
 interesting time this for the weather 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.369
 I really needed a break. 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.759
 It's like it's made for me, of course. 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.759
 that I'm going to buy 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:46.440
 I is not a champion el el el mother did not 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.250
 will have to do better than this to 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.409
 police 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.560
 Next time I hit wherever I am. 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.560
 all trying to hit me miss again 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 topper 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.470
 this smell of a new beginning 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 time to get into trouble the day of 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.459
 someone is about to be detonated will 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.390
 have to teach this trick of yours I would have 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.640
 survived okay but it was still up 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.290
 Has anyone seen my paradox? 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.850
 You ask him today that I have the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.750
 time line was already broken when 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.110
 I thought 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.450
 I swear to goodness I have no idea what 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.070
 I'm doing this is the second 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.470
 Throughout my life 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.480
 travel on the brain do not time my some 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.650
 how many pilots are needed to 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.450
 make a screen all of them 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.290
 while pilots are needed to 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.450
 make a hammer no effect on zau 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.690
 how many pilots are needed to 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:03.350
 do the hammer two if you count the reflex 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.350
 from jaci angeles 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.060
 I've never been lucky 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.359
 I never needed every second it matters 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.160
 You know it will cause doubt 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.500
 I love that no one can hold me 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.940
 time does not heal all wounds 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.070
 I give up until I hit 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.750
 we make the future not progress 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.220
 belongs only one city 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.380
 tomorrow is the last of my 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.180
 Worries Never Look Back 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.380
 nothing will improve on its own 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.359
 back to move forward 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.700
 I am my own double vision is the 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.060
 future every rule needs to be broken to 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.070
 Science that is it, do not win once I 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.239
 I 'm just going to rewind I hate being 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.120
 responsible 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.380
 my past chases me I'd rather go wrong 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.080
 than doing nothing 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.270
 I do not owe them anything, I finish everything 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.590
 I always start there will be consequences if 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.960
 there are limits 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.300
 I have not found it yet, I need to 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.410
 rethink a few stops I'll be back sooner 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.150
 to realize what I've been 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.670
 I'll take a breath, they 'll 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.650
 They wanted me to stay here rolled 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.790
 exactly the way I did not want it 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.810
 back to the 7th best not to do 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.580
 this again 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.370
 there is a second time to 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:21.540
 everything worked out in another timeline 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:27.300
 catch attention do not blink think fast do not 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:30.560
 Come here and get a surprise. 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.560
 frozen in time 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.350
 though careful 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.710
 I already calculated your chances 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.730
 sorry I saw your future nothing more 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.220

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.490
