Suicide Squad movie that that just
doesn't<00:00:43.020> seem<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:43.890> big-name

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
doesn't seem to be the right big-name

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
doesn't seem to be the right big-name
hero<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.329> into<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> Suicide<00:00:46.170> Squad<00:00:46.320> movie

hero to put into a Suicide Squad movie
doesn't<00:00:46.920> fit<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> big<00:00:48.930> fan<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
doesn't fit all so I'm a big fan of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260 
doesn't fit all so I'm a big fan of
common<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.250> does<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> sport<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.820> loved<00:00:51.120> him

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
common when he does a sport I loved him

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.779 
common when he does a sport I loved him
and<00:00:51.360> wanted<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.890> he's<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.219> these

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and wanted actually when he's in these

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
and wanted actually when he's in these
smaller<00:00:54.180> supporting<00:00:54.420> roles<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.170> he

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
smaller supporting roles I think he

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.250 
smaller supporting roles I think he
shines<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.879> he<00:00:57.180> carry<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> put

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
shines can he carry because if you put

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.389 
shines can he carry because if you put
him<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.440> heroes<00:00:58.620> Green<00:00:58.829> Lantern<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.250> means

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
him in heroes Green Lantern that means

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.529 
him in heroes Green Lantern that means
he's<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.640> Green<00:00:59.789> Lantern<00:01:00.090> moving<00:01:00.300> forward

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
he's your Green Lantern moving forward

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
he's your Green Lantern moving forward
can<00:01:00.960> he<00:01:01.079> carry<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.440> franchise<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.850> think

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
can he carry a franchise I don't think

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.759

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
he can I love him in the roles that he

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.630 
he can I love him in the roles that he
takes<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.400> he<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.519> carry

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.699 
splayed it but he may play someone
clearly<00:02:18.780> different<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> tone<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
clearly different but the tone of the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.660 
clearly different but the tone of the
carrot<00:02:19.950> he's<00:02:20.040> played<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.370> past

in<00:02:40.410> there<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> quick<00:02:41.130> scene<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.239> don't

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
in there for a quick scene but I don't

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.490 
in there for a quick scene but I don't
know<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.720> bring<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:42.989> comment<00:02:43.319> for<00:02:43.440> a

quick<00:02:43.650> scene<00:02:43.890> he<00:02:43.980> probably<00:02:44.130> has<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> little

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
quick scene he probably has a little

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.500 
quick scene he probably has a little
juice<00:02:44.760> year<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.180> roll
