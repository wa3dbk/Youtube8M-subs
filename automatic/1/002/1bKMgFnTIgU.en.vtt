00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850
 so defended spirit and empress to come 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:05.650
 how to get the pad for this trick 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.180
 Steins have a very cool pad with the 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.980
 pretty new model we are in cala 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.599
 d'or we are below this post 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.669
 where to get that scared butt that big 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.249
 must annihilate annoying cannon and allowed this 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.680
 cave with slow slay sun and 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.050
 the whole stuff such quasi the patch 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.970
 but the greedy luther protect 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.770
 Of course that does not just protect that 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.090
 dark frogs so easy that's us 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.010
 have to be careful here that does it all 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 very well hurt her see that here ne 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.390
 we can hedge ourselves a bit 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.429
 abilities but otherwise we as well 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.159
 People who are trained by the sound 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.379
 of the sun king here respectively 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.879
 here sweetheart where louder such 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.530
 things have not been a thing for 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.409
 us and there is then the chest with the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.149
 patch of coordinates 54 27 approximately 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.519
 could trace that up at the minimap 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.170
 and on the right you can not go up you have to 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.289
 nor are then but relatively safe 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.929
 in front of this laser and could then from 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.769
 I had to bleed down for three hours 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.210
 use to try high up there 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.100
 so i jump that looks pretty cool 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.319
 like bob the builder lets greet 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.639
 steinheimer cool pet also has 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.140
 a little extra animation if you want it 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.520
 unpacks then also stick around the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.280
 the skills screeching gears 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.310
 thunder lightning pikachu style 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.530
 we also cleaned up quite nice 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.210
 thing we have the woodcarver 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.950
 Of course then only in the second row 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.960
 we have a classic so we charge 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.880
 mechanics skills and rebuild 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.920
 So a really nice social 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.870
 mechanical pad and in addition sees that 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.850
 Also pretty good if we look 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.690
 he would look without shadow 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.400
 not bad so that's what it looks like 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.240
 also makes a lot of noise 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.730
 go down well 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.170
 and so then like a stone because 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.160
 hand would not wander in yes me 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.080
 I hope I could guide you with this 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.250
 help answer your questions wishes 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.020
 have fun with yours 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.940
 Steinheimer pad and say goodbye 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.940
 until the next party 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 judge
