in<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.760> am<00:00:03.030> gonna<00:00:03.300> show<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:04.160> how<00:00:05.160> I

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
in this video I am gonna show you how I

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.540 
in this video I am gonna show you how I
rejuvenate<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.390> couple<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.080> NiCad<00:00:07.950> batteries

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
rejuvenate a couple of NiCad batteries

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.660 
rejuvenate a couple of NiCad batteries
now<00:00:09.440> after<00:00:10.440> doing<00:00:10.679> some<00:00:10.830> research<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.519> even

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
now after doing some research and even

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.930 
now after doing some research and even
looking<00:00:12.000> at<00:00:12.090> other<00:00:12.320> YouTube<00:00:13.320> videos<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:14.040> see

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
looking at other YouTube videos I see

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.310 
looking at other YouTube videos I see
that<00:00:15.179> some<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> people<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:17.420> using<00:00:18.420> an<00:00:18.690> arc

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that some of the people are using an arc

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.849 
that some of the people are using an arc
welder<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.510> give<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.930> amperage<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
welder to give you the amperage and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.929 
welder to give you the amperage and
voltage<00:00:23.449> to<00:00:24.920> rejuvenate<00:00:25.920> these<00:00:26.519> NiCad

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
voltage to rejuvenate these NiCad

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.790 
voltage to rejuvenate these NiCad
batteries<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> those<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
batteries I don't have one of those and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310 
batteries I don't have one of those and
I<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:29.970> thinking<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.599> long<00:00:30.630> time<00:00:30.960> where<00:00:31.199> I'm

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I was thinking for a long time where I'm

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.850 
I was thinking for a long time where I'm
going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> find<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:33.680> 36<00:00:34.680> volt<00:00:34.770> source<00:00:35.809> to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
going to find a 36 volt source to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.970 
going to find a 36 volt source to
rejuvenate<00:00:37.860> my<00:00:38.610> dead<00:00:38.910> NiCad<00:00:39.390> batteries<00:00:40.050> so

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
rejuvenate my dead NiCad batteries so

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
rejuvenate my dead NiCad batteries so
after<00:00:41.760> thinking<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.899> bit<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
after thinking for a little bit I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.040 
after thinking for a little bit I
realized<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.280> actually<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.910> two<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
realized that I can actually use two of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.369 
realized that I can actually use two of
my<00:00:46.200> existing<00:00:46.710> ryobi<00:00:47.250> 18v<00:00:48.050> batteries<00:00:49.050> lisa

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
my existing ryobi 18v batteries lisa

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
my existing ryobi 18v batteries lisa
NiCad<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:51.050> use<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.530> series<00:00:53.360> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
NiCad and use these two in series to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.479 
NiCad and use these two in series to
jumpstart<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> rejuvenate<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.730> old<00:00:57.000> Sears

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
jumpstart and rejuvenate these old Sears

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.110 
jumpstart and rejuvenate these old Sears
16.8<00:00:59.489> volt<00:00:59.870> batteries<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.949> had<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
16.8 volt batteries and I had to do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.070 
16.8 volt batteries and I had to do
these<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:04.339> these<00:01:05.339> batteries<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.330> are

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
these because these batteries here are

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.280 
these because these batteries here are
completely<00:01:07.590> dead<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:09.290> probably

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
completely dead they are about probably

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.760 
completely dead they are about probably
7<00:01:10.740> years<00:01:10.770> old<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.320> that's<00:01:13.320> another<00:01:13.560> reason

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
7 years old and that's another reason

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
7 years old and that's another reason
actually<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.189> went<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> ryobi<00:01:15.030> because

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
actually I went with the ryobi because

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.620 
actually I went with the ryobi because
after<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.470> ones<00:01:16.710> died<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.310> basically<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
after these ones died I basically put it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.399 
after these ones died I basically put it
aside<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.140> never<00:01:19.409> used<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:21.630> started

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
aside I never used it and I started

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.249 
aside I never used it and I started
using<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.680> Ryobi<00:01:23.280> tools<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
using my Ryobi tools and this is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.819 
using my Ryobi tools and this is
actually<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.710> year's<00:01:27.350> drill<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.560> cordless

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
actually this year's drill the cordless

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.300 
actually this year's drill the cordless
drill<00:01:29.720> that<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.900> used<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.710> these<00:01:31.860> NiCad

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
drill that are used for these NiCad

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
drill that are used for these NiCad
batteries<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.509> technique<00:01:33.840> only<00:01:33.960> works

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
batteries now this technique only works

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
batteries now this technique only works
for<00:01:34.530> Nikon<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.700> use<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.299> nickel<00:01:36.659> metal

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
for Nikon do not use it for nickel metal

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.410 
for Nikon do not use it for nickel metal
hydride<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.520> any<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.729> type<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> batteries

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
hydride or any other type of batteries

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
hydride or any other type of batteries
because<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.500> probably<00:01:40.619> blow<00:01:40.950> up

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
because we do it will probably blow up

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.690 
because we do it will probably blow up
and<00:01:41.420> cause<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> lot<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.659> damage<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.610> what<00:01:44.610> I've

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and cause a lot of damage so what I've

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
and cause a lot of damage so what I've
done<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:46.049> my<00:01:46.259> 36<00:01:47.070> volt<00:01:47.540> in<00:01:48.540> series

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
done here is to get my 36 volt in series

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
done here is to get my 36 volt in series
I<00:01:49.640> actually<00:01:50.640> used<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:52.020> pretty<00:01:52.850> good<00:01:53.850> sized

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I actually used a pretty good sized

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
I actually used a pretty good sized
gauge<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:55.079> 16<00:01:55.560> gauge<00:01:55.740> wires

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
gauge I think these are 16 gauge wires

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.499 
gauge I think these are 16 gauge wires
and<00:01:56.780> let<00:01:57.780> me<00:01:57.899> zoom<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.259> here<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.299> see

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and let me zoom in here and you can see

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.499 
and let me zoom in here and you can see
that<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.670> don't<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> solder<00:02:03.149> these

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that I don't want to solder these

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969 
that I don't want to solder these
terminals<00:02:04.079> obviously<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> still

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
terminals obviously because I still

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.609 
terminals obviously because I still
gotta<00:02:05.189> use<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.460> batteries<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.899> stripped

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
gotta use these batteries so I stripped

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.449 
gotta use these batteries so I stripped
away<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> wire<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.450> put<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> jumper<00:02:10.110> from

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
away the wire and I put a jumper from

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.580 
away the wire and I put a jumper from
the<00:02:11.459> positive<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> negative

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the positive here to the negative

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.040 
the positive here to the negative
okay<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.670> site<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.450> negative<00:02:15.750> side

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
okay so the site is the negative side

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.220 
okay so the site is the negative side
and<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> positive<00:02:17.550> side<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and this is the positive side so if I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.040 
and this is the positive side so if I
measure<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.739> voltage<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.319> negative

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
measure the voltage this is the negative

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.070 
measure the voltage this is the negative
and<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> look<00:02:25.380> at<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> multimeter<00:02:27.080> ship

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
and if you look at the multimeter ship

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.300 
and if you look at the multimeter ship
it<00:02:28.230> over<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:30.769> see<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> will

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it over a little bit you see that I will

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.990 
it over a little bit you see that I will
get<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.950> actually<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.370> little<00:02:35.519> bit<00:02:35.670> more<00:02:35.790> than

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
get it's actually a little bit more than

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.690 
get it's actually a little bit more than
36<00:02:36.450> volt<00:02:36.660> because<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.830> output<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.220> these<00:02:38.400> are

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
36 volt because the output on these are

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.130 
36 volt because the output on these are
almost<00:02:39.500> 20<00:02:40.500> volt<00:02:40.709> each<00:02:41.010> almost<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.989> is

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
almost 20 volt each almost so this is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.990 
almost 20 volt each almost so this is
where<00:02:43.319> my<00:02:43.349> power<00:02:44.340> source<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.880> be

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
where my power source is going to be

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.750 
where my power source is going to be
coming<00:02:45.269> from<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.950> once<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.580> hooked

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
coming from and once I have this hooked

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.390 
coming from and once I have this hooked
up<00:02:47.940> oh<00:02:48.260> yes<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.410> more<00:02:49.500> thing<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.830> you'll

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
up oh yes one more thing is you'll

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.229 
up oh yes one more thing is you'll
notice<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:52.310> wire<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.819> way<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> attached

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
notice that the wire the way I attached

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.960 
notice that the wire the way I attached
it<00:02:54.450> was<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> couple<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.430> nylon<00:02:56.430> straps<00:02:56.730> or

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
it was with a couple of nylon straps or

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.630 
it was with a couple of nylon straps or
tie<00:02:57.600> wraps<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.590> basically<00:02:58.799> cinched<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.519> up

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
tie wraps and I basically cinched it up

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.350 
tie wraps and I basically cinched it up
really<00:03:00.000> tight<00:03:00.650> after<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:02.090> stripped<00:03:03.090> off<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
really tight after I stripped off the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.650 
really tight after I stripped off the
wire<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.810> bent<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.890> over<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:06.420> made<00:03:06.540> it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
wire I bent it over and then made it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.100 
wire I bent it over and then made it
thick<00:03:06.840> enough<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:08.099> would<00:03:08.250> basically<00:03:08.519> be

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
thick enough so it would basically be

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.470 
thick enough so it would basically be
fitted<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.290> press<00:03:10.980> against<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> contacts<00:03:11.760> so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
fitted to press against the contacts so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.729 
fitted to press against the contacts so
these<00:03:12.630> are<00:03:12.780> pretty<00:03:12.930> tight<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.200> won't<00:03:13.380> won't

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
these are pretty tight you won't won't

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.490 
these are pretty tight you won't won't
come<00:03:13.980> loose<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.870> jump-start<00:03:19.170> these

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
come loose so now to jump-start these

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.449 
come loose so now to jump-start these
batteries<00:03:20.100> what<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> did<00:03:21.329> was<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.660> with<00:03:21.959> the

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
batteries what I did was that with the

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.430 
batteries what I did was that with the
old<00:03:23.459> batteries<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.120> let<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.750> actually<00:03:25.109> train

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
old batteries I let it actually train

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.270 
old batteries I let it actually train
and<00:03:25.709> die

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
and die

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.170 
and die
so<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.900> would<00:03:28.049> be<00:03:28.170> zero<00:03:28.470> volt<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.180> I

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
so that it would be zero volt and I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.930 
so that it would be zero volt and I
actually<00:03:30.540> pulled<00:03:30.840> these<00:03:30.959> out<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:32.579> morning

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
actually pulled these out this morning

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.520 
actually pulled these out this morning
after<00:03:33.269> sitting<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> shelf<00:03:34.079> for<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> good

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
after sitting on the shelf for a good

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.759 
after sitting on the shelf for a good
couple<00:03:34.769> years<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:36.200> you'll<00:03:37.200> notice<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
couple years and you'll notice on the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.789 
couple years and you'll notice on the
top<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> battery<00:03:38.670> terminal<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
top of the battery terminal you have the

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.740 
top of the battery terminal you have the
positive<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.180> negative<00:03:42.959> terminal<00:03:43.709> okay

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
positive and the negative terminal okay

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.350 
positive and the negative terminal okay
let<00:03:45.750> me<00:03:45.840> zoom<00:03:46.019> back<00:03:46.079> out<00:03:46.350> here<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.769> see

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.170 

and<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:52.410> procedure<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.520> need<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
and the procedure you need to do is this

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.280 
and the procedure you need to do is this
the<00:03:55.020> negative<00:03:55.260> terminal<00:03:56.240> okay<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.510> your<00:03:58.080> power

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
the negative terminal okay of your power

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.610 
the negative terminal okay of your power
source<00:03:58.530> will<00:03:59.430> connected<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.880> negative<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.620> your

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
source will connected a negative of your

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.970 
source will connected a negative of your
NiCad<00:04:01.950> battery<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:03.290> then<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> positive

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
NiCad battery and then on the positive

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.210 
NiCad battery and then on the positive
terminal<00:04:05.430> okay<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:07.110> quickly<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.980> hold<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
terminal okay you quickly just hold it

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.830 
terminal okay you quickly just hold it
really<00:04:08.340> tightly<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.120> don't<00:04:09.270> drop<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.600> or

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
really tightly so you don't drop it or

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.710 
really tightly so you don't drop it or
lose<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.020> okay<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:11.250> zap<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:12.240> positive

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
lose it okay you zap the positive

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.090 
lose it okay you zap the positive
contact<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:15.000> will<00:04:15.120> give<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.630> spark<00:04:16.100> now

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
contact and it will give you a spark now

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.160 
contact and it will give you a spark now
I'm<00:04:17.880> not<00:04:18.090> going<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.780> battery

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
I'm not going to do it on this battery

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.590 
I'm not going to do it on this battery
because<00:04:19.440> both<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.890> these<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.280> already<00:04:21.239> tried<00:04:21.570> it

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
because both of these I already tried it

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.080 
because both of these I already tried it
couple<00:04:22.350> hours<00:04:22.530> ago<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.040> these<00:04:23.760> are<00:04:23.880> fully

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
couple hours ago and these are fully

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.730 
couple hours ago and these are fully
charged<00:04:24.510> actually<00:04:24.930> charge<00:04:25.170> these<00:04:25.350> up<00:04:25.530> and

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
charged actually charge these up and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.170 
charged actually charge these up and
it's<00:04:26.100> working<00:04:26.310> right<00:04:26.580> now<00:04:26.670> that's<00:04:26.880> why<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.000> want

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
it's working right now that's why I want

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.080 
it's working right now that's why I want
to<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.450> video<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.530> can<00:04:28.680> see<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.090> but

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
to do this video so you can see it but

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.330 
to do this video so you can see it but
the<00:04:30.180> procedure<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.900> okay<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.860> put<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.190> on

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
the procedure is this okay you put it on

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.810 
the procedure is this okay you put it on
the<00:04:32.490> negative<00:04:33.480> okay<00:04:34.200> grab<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.310> positive

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
the negative okay grab the positive

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.780 
the negative okay grab the positive
touch<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.600> positive<00:04:37.020> lead<00:04:37.200> okay<00:04:37.950> now<00:04:38.730> I'm

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
touch the positive lead okay now I'm

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.190 
touch the positive lead okay now I'm
just<00:04:38.820> going<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.090> simulate<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:39.960> know

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
just going to simulate it so you know

you stop if you measure the terminal

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.750 
you stop if you measure the terminal
you'll<00:05:02.460> see<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:03.990> your<00:05:04.140> volt<00:05:04.350> meter

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
you'll see that on your volt meter

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.580 
you'll see that on your volt meter
you'll<00:05:05.760> get<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.180> voltage<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:07.410> say

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
you'll get a voltage and as you say

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.890 
you'll get a voltage and as you say
about<00:05:07.800> well<00:05:08.370> for<00:05:08.550> these<00:05:08.700> sixteen<00:05:09.570> point<00:05:09.780> eight

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
about well for these sixteen point eight

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.659 
about well for these sixteen point eight
volt<00:05:10.169> batteries<00:05:10.650> it'll<00:05:11.040> gave<00:05:11.250> me<00:05:11.460> about

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
volt batteries it'll gave me about

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.159 
volt batteries it'll gave me about
eighteen<00:05:12.120> volt<00:05:12.620> after<00:05:13.620> zapping<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.419> now<00:05:15.419> that

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
eighteen volt after zapping it now that

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.320 
eighteen volt after zapping it now that
initial<00:05:17.040> jolt<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:19.610> voltage<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.940> measured

initial jolt the voltage is measured

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.620 
initial jolt the voltage is measured
here<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.690> not<00:05:22.650> going<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.860> stay<00:05:23.070> long<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.700> at

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
here is not going to stay long so at

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.920 
here is not going to stay long so at
this<00:05:24.870> point<00:05:25.640> you<00:05:26.640> need<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:26.850> let<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.510> battery

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
this point you need to let this battery

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.170 
this point you need to let this battery
after<00:05:28.140> zapping<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.740> let<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.160> sit<00:05:29.580> for<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.970> good

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
after zapping it let it sit for a good

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.720 
after zapping it let it sit for a good
fifteen<00:05:30.570> minutes<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.500> just<00:05:32.370> let<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.520> cool

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
fifteen minutes and just let it cool

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.760 
fifteen minutes and just let it cool
down<00:05:32.790> internally<00:05:33.570> there's<00:05:34.440> some<00:05:34.590> heat

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
down internally there's some heat

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.120 
down internally there's some heat
buildup<00:05:35.100> in<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.310> cells<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:36.180> let<00:05:36.360> it<00:05:36.450> cool<00:05:36.870> down

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
buildup in the cells so let it cool down

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.730 
buildup in the cells so let it cool down
okay<00:05:38.130> after<00:05:38.490> fifteen<00:05:39.030> minutes

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
okay after fifteen minutes

it<00:05:47.270> okay<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:49.410> procedure<00:05:49.860> that<00:05:50.190> I've<00:05:50.370> read

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
it okay and the procedure that I've read

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.630 
it okay and the procedure that I've read
on<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.790> Internet<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.479> if<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:53.160> do<00:05:53.400> this

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
on the Internet is that if you do this

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.690 
on the Internet is that if you do this
you<00:05:54.090> zap<00:05:54.390> it<00:05:54.630> wait<00:05:55.020> 15<00:05:55.560> minutes<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.160> you

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
you zap it wait 15 minutes and you

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.110 
you zap it wait 15 minutes and you
charge<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.620> if<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:58.770> doesn't<00:05:58.979> work<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.940> can

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
charge it and if it doesn't work you can

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.010 
charge it and if it doesn't work you can
try<00:06:00.150> zapping<00:06:00.870> it<00:06:00.990> again

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
try zapping it again

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.310 
try zapping it again
if<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.950> try<00:06:03.280> this<00:06:03.340> a<00:06:03.820> couple<00:06:03.880> of<00:06:04.570> times<00:06:04.870> and

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
if you try this a couple of times and

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.380 
if you try this a couple of times and
it's<00:06:06.280> still<00:06:06.460> not<00:06:06.610> working

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
it's still not working

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.020 
it's still not working
then<00:06:08.110> one<00:06:08.380> of<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.560> cell<00:06:08.830> one<00:06:09.190> or<00:06:09.340> more<00:06:09.520> cell<00:06:09.850> in

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
then one of the cell one or more cell in

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.670 
then one of the cell one or more cell in
there<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:10.300> could<00:06:10.480> be<00:06:10.600> just<00:06:10.840> completely<00:06:11.200> dead

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
there it could be just completely dead

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.280 
there it could be just completely dead
it<00:06:11.800> could<00:06:11.950> be<00:06:12.040> just<00:06:12.250> bad<00:06:12.460> so<00:06:12.910> and<00:06:13.180> and<00:06:14.080> there's

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
it could be just bad so and and there's

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.000 
it could be just bad so and and there's
no<00:06:14.410> rejuvenation<00:06:15.220> on<00:06:15.370> that<00:06:15.550> cell<00:06:15.790> so<00:06:17.010> but

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
no rejuvenation on that cell so but

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.800 
no rejuvenation on that cell so but
right<00:06:18.160> now<00:06:18.250> I'm<00:06:18.340> very<00:06:18.400> happy<00:06:18.580> because<00:06:19.060> as<00:06:19.330> you

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
right now I'm very happy because as you

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.090 
right now I'm very happy because as you
know<00:06:19.930> replacing<00:06:20.410> these<00:06:20.500> cells<00:06:20.770> are<00:06:20.920> very

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
know replacing these cells are very

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.220 
know replacing these cells are very
expensive<00:06:21.340> and<00:06:21.700> I'm<00:06:22.600> able<00:06:22.780> to<00:06:22.960> bring<00:06:23.800> my<00:06:24.040> old

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
expensive and I'm able to bring my old

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.650 
expensive and I'm able to bring my old
NiCad<00:06:26.230> batteries<00:06:26.590> back<00:06:26.800> to<00:06:26.950> life<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.880> I<00:06:28.450> can

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
NiCad batteries back to life and I can

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.290 
NiCad batteries back to life and I can
start<00:06:28.900> using<00:06:29.050> another<00:06:29.410> drill<00:06:29.710> so<00:06:30.700> that<00:06:31.030> I<00:06:31.060> have

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
start using another drill so that I have

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.590 
start using another drill so that I have
a<00:06:31.330> spare<00:06:31.720> now<00:06:32.280> anyways<00:06:33.280> I<00:06:33.520> hope<00:06:33.970> this<00:06:34.240> helps

you<00:06:34.720> in<00:06:34.960> case<00:06:35.470> you<00:06:35.680> guys<00:06:35.890> want<00:06:36.640> to<00:06:36.790> know<00:06:36.910> how<00:06:37.030> to

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
you in case you guys want to know how to

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.730 
you in case you guys want to know how to
do<00:06:37.300> this<00:06:37.420> because<00:06:37.600> people<00:06:37.930> were<00:06:38.170> saying<00:06:38.470> you

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
do this because people were saying you

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.210 
do this because people were saying you
can<00:06:39.700> use<00:06:40.330> car<00:06:40.900> batteries<00:06:41.560> you<00:06:41.920> can<00:06:42.040> use

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
can use car batteries you can use

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.400 
can use car batteries you can use
lantern<00:06:42.880> batteries

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
lantern batteries

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.830 
lantern batteries
a<00:06:44.440> lot<00:06:45.070> of<00:06:45.100> these<00:06:45.270> for<00:06:46.270> most<00:06:46.450> people<00:06:46.720> I<00:06:46.750> don't

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
a lot of these for most people I don't

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.380 
a lot of these for most people I don't
think<00:06:46.930> is<00:06:47.110> very<00:06:47.140> common<00:06:47.710> so<00:06:48.190> if<00:06:49.030> you<00:06:49.210> have

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
think is very common so if you have
