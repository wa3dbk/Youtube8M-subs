JAROSLAV KULHAVY: Hi.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.410
I'm Jaroslav Kulhavy.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.540
We are in Tirol in Austria.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.330
And we are just before the World
Marathon Championship.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.030
The Epic is perfect for
me, for my body.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.320
And I like the full suspension,
because--

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.300
and it just worked.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.490
Worked [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.140
And traction is very difficult,
very technical,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.450
very bumpy.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.420
And this bike is pretty
good for this

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.480
condition for this terrain.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.040
And I love the brand, because
when I go on the road, the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.760
bike is pretty safe, and the
terrain is amazing, soft.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.410
And I can go really fast, and
the bike saves my energy.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.200
I mean because it's way hard,
because the first climb I went

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.330
yesterday about one hour.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.020
And I think not so good for me
because the climbs are pretty

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.720
steep, pretty long,
and no technical.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.280
I don't say, just now, what
it will be on Saturday.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.300
But I mean the course
will be best for

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.122
lightweight riders, and--

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:28.565
yeah.

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:36.250
The Marathon World Champ is last
day, which I'm missing

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.330
because I won everything--

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.710
Olympic gold medal, World
Champs, World Cup.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.480
So I would like to win same time
Marathon Worlds, but I

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.410
don't know win this year, or
next year, or next time.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.740
But it's one of mine, one of
mine aim for future to win

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.990
Marathon Worlds.
