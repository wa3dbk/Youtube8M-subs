00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.509
 It was a good day. 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.420
 today I will teach to do flowers and glass 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.420
 let's not make peach blossoms 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 violet attention to the elements that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 they need 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.430
 this is a support for the forest 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 to make flowers clana a beak for 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 petal garden any minute for one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 little icing on support for 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 flower to the globe and stick a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.670
 paper square was you can 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 use cellophane foil 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.460
 the one you already have at home 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.170
 Let's do the coursework, let's do it. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.950
 very slowly so that you can 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 learn the thicker side because this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.539
 spout on one side is thicker and then 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.770
 other thinner support in the middle and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.320
 press the subject by rotating short bracket 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.379
 and there's a play to bring here live in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 low down on the stump and left 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.439
 and so we always do by supporting the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 beak under the previous and coastline is 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.299
 we do this again and the last one that gives 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 more work requires more 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.820
 cut find there I try to stay 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 some point in time to tell the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.860
 you can correct with the brush with a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 bit of cornstarch and then with a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.140
 Xinhua cartridge try to make three 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.040
 in the middle and we have the flower already 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 finished and ready to use we remove 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.540
 the support we put in any 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.049
 surface to stay is another 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:49.740
 Let's make another stick the paper and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:56.960
 note the 1 passed a two three 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:59.690
 stump 4 and 5 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.940
 yesterday 30 the good guys in the middle and when 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.400
 already practiced in this have 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.220
 fast they can make these kitchen alone 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.580
 I shoot and put it to dry and I'm not going to use it. 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.750
 now another bag of confectionery also with 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.600
 petal beak a little smaller and with 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.340
 violet icing has a little themed 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.120
 We're going to arrive with a black spot. 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.190
 earth and air 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.440
 the guaranÃ­ then remember that we are 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.510
 using real icing because after all 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.760
 This is followed by just putting the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:37.250
 paper and we make three stones a 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.610
 three turns support her and I make two 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.150
 longer legs one and two in 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.580
 poem and also put three dots 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.019
 yellow in the middle 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.850
 they will transfer or another 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.190
 Quickly she goes to the wall and let's go 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.950
 use aluminum foil to show how 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.790
 with any one can perform these 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:09.650
 flowers and do so see a 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 two three short one and 2006 and with practice 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.049
 You're already going to make these little flowers with 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.180
 very quickly and withdraw and I will tell 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.150
 we do with it should be allowed 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.650
 dry for 24 hours at room temperature 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680
 environment 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.850
 here I have some already dried 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.670
 I bring it here in different roles and 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.850
 see how it unfolds 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.880
 gently and are already free of the 14 years 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.200
 I feel that you can keep 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.200
 reuse again 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.030
 We have 14 years of various types. 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.519
 these flowers should be stored in 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.870
 The boxes are ready to 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.390
 decorate the mouth 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.940
 now let's see how to apply these 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.660
 flowers on the cake already finished let's go 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.660
 continue to learn
