it's pretty big 475 it's got some really
s<00:01:19.190> had<00:01:19.460> some<00:01:19.610> serious<00:01:20.149> growth<00:01:20.899> spurts<00:01:21.350> when<00:01:21.560> it

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
s had some serious growth spurts when it

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
s had some serious growth spurts when it
was<00:01:21.799> young<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.940> can<00:01:23.149> see<00:01:23.390> here<00:01:24.130> how<00:01:25.130> big<00:01:25.460> those

the<00:01:26.000> distance<00:01:26.390> between<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.810> Rings<00:01:27.100> of<00:01:28.100> course

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
the distance between the Rings of course

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.850 
the distance between the Rings of course
each<00:01:28.550> ring<00:01:28.819> is<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.060> years<00:01:29.300> with<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.569> growth

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
each ring is the years with the growth

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.730 
each ring is the years with the growth
it<00:01:30.860> tells<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.220> how<00:01:31.399> quickly<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.330> grew<00:01:32.740> you

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
it tells you how quickly it grew you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.760 
it tells you how quickly it grew you
know<00:01:33.830> up<00:01:34.069> especially<00:01:34.490> out<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:34.970> way<00:01:35.500> up<00:01:36.500> until

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
know up especially out this way up until

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.760 
know up especially out this way up until
this<00:01:37.220> point<00:01:37.340> here<00:01:37.789> you<00:01:37.819> know<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.390> first

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
this point here you know so it's first

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.830 
this point here you know so it's first
25<00:01:39.770> or<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.100> years<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.909> really<00:01:41.360> took<00:01:41.600> off<00:01:41.810> and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
25 or so years it it really took off and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.630 
25 or so years it it really took off and
then<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.229> slowed<00:01:42.590> down<00:01:42.789> precipitously<00:01:45.640> then

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
then it slowed down precipitously then

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.249 
then it slowed down precipitously then
started<00:01:47.119> getting<00:01:47.179> slower<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.690> slower<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
started getting slower and slower so the

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.880 
started getting slower and slower so the
best<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:48.530> can<00:01:48.590> count<00:01:48.890> about<00:01:49.009> 75<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:51.530> got<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.709> lot

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
best I can count about 75 it's got a lot

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.670 
best I can count about 75 it's got a lot
of<00:01:51.920> color<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:55.520> gray<00:01:55.820> color

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
of color in it that gray color

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.139 
of color in it that gray color
you<00:01:57.680> know<00:01:57.799> pine<00:01:58.100> is<00:01:58.430> usually<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> real<00:01:59.030> nice

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
you know pine is usually a real nice

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.999 
you know pine is usually a real nice
yellow<00:02:02.149> color<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:05.649> so<00:02:06.649> that's<00:02:06.859> I<00:02:08.890> don't<00:02:09.890> know

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
yellow color and so that's I don't know

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.280 
yellow color and so that's I don't know
what<00:02:10.190> causes<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.729> great<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.570> seems<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.019> me<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
what causes that great it seems to me to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.020 
what causes that great it seems to me to
be<00:02:12.579> maybe<00:02:13.579> water<00:02:13.910> stained<00:02:15.400> step<00:02:16.400> water<00:02:16.730> in

can<00:05:00.400> get<00:05:00.490> some<00:05:00.639> Timbers<00:05:00.970> out<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.360> I

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
can get some Timbers out of there I

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.670 
can get some Timbers out of there I
really<00:05:04.210> do<00:05:04.330> think<00:05:04.509> this<00:05:04.690> pine<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:05.139> gonna<00:05:05.289> do<00:05:07.680> it

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
really do think this pine is gonna do it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.379 
really do think this pine is gonna do it
feels<00:05:08.889> funny<00:05:09.190> sound<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.759> think<00:05:10.060> I'll<00:05:10.210> go<00:05:10.360> ahead

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
feels funny sound I think I'll go ahead

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.450 
feels funny sound I think I'll go ahead
and<00:05:10.840> cut<00:05:10.990> some<00:05:11.169> Timbers<00:05:11.590> or<00:05:11.800> at<00:05:12.250> least<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
and cut some Timbers or at least a

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.520 
and cut some Timbers or at least a
couple<00:05:12.669> see<00:05:13.509> how<00:05:13.630> they<00:05:13.750> turn<00:05:13.960> out<00:05:13.990> see<00:05:14.349> what

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
couple see how they turn out see what

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.450 
couple see how they turn out see what
happens<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.180> this<00:05:16.180> might<00:05:17.099> might<00:05:18.099> just<00:05:18.310> work

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
happens and this might might just work

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.150 
happens and this might might just work
out<00:05:18.669> if<00:05:19.419> you<00:05:19.599> guys<00:05:19.720> remember<00:05:20.139> the<00:05:20.500> back<00:05:21.009> to

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
out if you guys remember the back to

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.730 
out if you guys remember the back to
basics<00:05:21.310> series<00:05:21.610> where<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.090> kind<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.870> did<00:05:23.380> steps

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
basics series where I kind of did steps

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.529 
basics series where I kind of did steps
step<00:05:25.080> incremental<00:05:26.080> steps<00:05:26.320> of<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:27.539> bridge

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
step incremental steps of that bridge

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.570 
step incremental steps of that bridge
I'm<00:05:29.440> going<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.680> do<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.860> same<00:05:30.009> thing<00:05:30.280> here<00:05:30.490> I'm

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
I'm going to do the same thing here I'm

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.890 
I'm going to do the same thing here I'm
not<00:05:30.729> going<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:30.970> let<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.300> cat<00:05:31.479> out<00:05:31.509> of<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.720> bag

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
not going to let the cat out of the bag

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.480 
not going to let the cat out of the bag
of<00:05:32.110> what<00:05:32.229> I'm<00:05:32.349> building<00:05:32.740> but<00:05:33.130> it's<00:05:33.280> something

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
of what I'm building but it's something

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.339 
of what I'm building but it's something
it's<00:05:33.759> gonna<00:05:33.880> be<00:05:34.030> really<00:05:34.180> cool<00:05:34.479> and<00:05:34.780> it's

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
it's gonna be really cool and it's

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.589 
it's gonna be really cool and it's
something<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:36.419> timber-framed

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
something that is timber-framed

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.600 
something that is timber-framed
it's<00:05:37.870> going<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.110> depend<00:05:38.889> on<00:05:39.069> how<00:05:39.220> well<00:05:39.400> these

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
it's going to depend on how well these

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.240 
it's going to depend on how well these
Timbers<00:05:39.940> come<00:05:40.150> out<00:05:40.300> so<00:05:41.229> it<00:05:41.470> still<00:05:41.710> remains<00:05:42.159> to

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
Timbers come out so it still remains to

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.890 
Timbers come out so it still remains to
be<00:05:42.310> seen<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:42.610> I'm<00:05:42.849> pretty<00:05:43.000> sure<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.509> I<00:05:43.599> think

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
be seen but I'm pretty sure that I think

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.469 
be seen but I'm pretty sure that I think
so<00:05:44.169> far<00:05:44.380> it<00:05:44.440> should<00:05:44.470> work<00:05:44.740> out<00:05:45.090> so<00:05:46.090> one<00:05:46.270> thing<00:05:46.419> I

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
so far it should work out so one thing I

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.360 
so far it should work out so one thing I
might<00:05:46.630> do<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:47.500> make<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.860> little<00:05:48.009> bit<00:05:48.190> more

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
might do to make this a little bit more

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.050 
might do to make this a little bit more
fun<00:05:48.880> and<00:05:48.909> interactive<00:05:49.620> is<00:05:50.669> this<00:05:51.669> will<00:05:51.789> be<00:05:51.880> kind

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
fun and interactive is this will be kind

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.550 
fun and interactive is this will be kind
of<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.180> learning<00:05:52.300> process<00:05:52.659> for<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:53.139> lot<00:05:53.289> of<00:05:53.380> guys
