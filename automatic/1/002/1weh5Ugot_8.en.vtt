00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
we're taking a look at an expansion for

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.040 
we're taking a look at an expansion for
this<00:00:23.590> zen-like<00:00:24.590> game<00:00:25.039> Tokaido<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:26.720> game<00:00:26.900> was

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
this zen-like game Tokaido this game was

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.250 
this zen-like game Tokaido this game was
really<00:00:27.230> popular<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:28.250> whole<00:00:28.580> moving<00:00:29.269> on<00:00:29.960> a

really popular the whole moving on a
linear<00:00:30.590> route

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
linear route

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.190 
linear route
well<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> expansion<00:00:31.820> is<00:00:31.970> a<00:00:32.210> lot<00:00:32.750> smaller<00:00:32.960> than

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
well the expansion is a lot smaller than

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.959 
well the expansion is a lot smaller than
the<00:00:33.290> original<00:00:33.380> game<00:00:33.649> yes<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.550> keidel

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
the original game yes it is the keidel

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.500 
the original game yes it is the keidel
crossroads<00:00:36.010> more<00:00:37.010> Zen<00:00:37.610> goodness

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
crossroads more Zen goodness

crossroads more Zen goodness
I<00:00:38.540> was<00:00:38.989> actually<00:00:39.370> this<00:00:40.370> one<00:00:40.579> they<00:00:40.670> announced

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
I was actually this one they announced

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.549 
I was actually this one they announced
the<00:00:41.030> expansion<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.570> was<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:41.840> does<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.320> game

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
the expansion I was like does this game

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.220 
the expansion I was like does this game
even<00:00:42.860> mean<00:00:43.129> we're<00:00:43.579> two<00:00:43.879> impossibly<00:00:44.629> add<00:00:44.930> are

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
even mean we're two impossibly add are

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.560 
even mean we're two impossibly add are
you<00:00:45.320> having<00:00:45.530> like<00:00:45.680> another<00:00:45.829> track<00:00:46.190> at<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.489> end

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
you having like another track at the end

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:55.919 
you having like another track at the end
let<00:00:47.570> me<00:00:47.660> show<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:47.899> what<00:00:48.020> they've<00:00:48.140> added

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.569 

so<00:00:56.929> what<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.140> expansion<00:00:57.710> adds<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.280> an

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
so what the expansion adds is an

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.759 
so what the expansion adds is an
entirely<00:00:58.940> new<00:00:59.239> board<00:00:59.570> with<00:00:59.899> a<00:00:59.929> stack<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.469> cards

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
entirely new board with a stack of cards

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.160 
entirely new board with a stack of cards
on<00:01:01.100> each<00:01:01.699> of<00:01:01.850> these<00:01:01.940> sections<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.659> what<00:01:02.929> this

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
on each of these sections and what this

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.550 
on each of these sections and what this
board<00:01:03.500> does<00:01:03.799> is<00:01:04.100> with<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.119> exception<00:01:05.899> of<00:01:06.049> the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
board does is with the exception of the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.639 
board does is with the exception of the
ends<00:01:07.130> each<00:01:07.759> spot<00:01:08.420> on<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.689> board<00:01:08.899> now<00:01:09.170> offers

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
ends each spot on the board now offers

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.450 
ends each spot on the board now offers
two<00:01:10.039> different<00:01:10.960> possibilities<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.830> let's<00:01:13.310> go

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
two different possibilities so let's go

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.350 
two different possibilities so let's go
through<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.759> different<00:01:13.850> ones<00:01:14.149> that<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.270> can

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
through the different ones that you can

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.859 
through the different ones that you can
do<00:01:14.630> first<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.560> all<00:01:15.680> whenever<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.640> stop<00:01:17.000> at<00:01:17.240> F

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
do first of all whenever you stop at F

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.440 
do first of all whenever you stop at F
form<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:19.220> forms<00:01:19.549> normally<00:01:19.729> give<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.119> three

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
form the forms normally give you three

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.380 
form the forms normally give you three
coins<00:01:20.689> you<00:01:21.409> can<00:01:21.619> take<00:01:21.890> three<00:01:22.250> coins<00:01:22.520> or<00:01:22.939> you

fewer roll times three get them back
plus<00:01:42.110> four<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.709> if<00:01:43.069> you're<00:01:43.190> all<00:01:43.340> four<00:01:43.610> times

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
plus four and if you're all four times

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.300

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.330 
four you get them back plus six more
coins<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.509> really<00:01:48.049> only<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.470> x<00:01:48.709> threes<00:01:49.130> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
coins so really only the x threes and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.940 
coins so really only the x threes and
fours<00:01:49.610> are<00:01:49.940> better<00:01:50.330> than<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.080> taking<00:01:51.530> three

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
fours are better than just taking three

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.309 
fours are better than just taking three
coins<00:01:52.189> but<00:01:52.909> gambling<00:01:53.479> works<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.229> to

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
coins but gambling works and you have to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.859 
coins but gambling works and you have to
have<00:01:54.409> some<00:01:54.590> coins<00:01:54.799> to<00:01:55.280> pull<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.670> off<00:01:55.880> when

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
have some coins to pull that off when

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.380 
have some coins to pull that off when
you<00:01:56.959> stop<00:01:57.229> at<00:01:57.379> any<00:01:57.560> panorama<00:01:58.220> spot<00:01:58.580> instead<00:01:59.269> of

you stop at any panorama spot instead of

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.389 
you stop at any panorama spot instead of

and<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.900> can<00:04:09.050> see<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:09.350> have<00:04:09.500> various<00:04:10.190> other

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
and so you can see we have various other

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.340 
and so you can see we have various other
people<00:04:10.820> some<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.390> them<00:04:11.540> let<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.840> take<00:04:12.050> both

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
people some of them let you take both

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.260 
people some of them let you take both
actions<00:04:12.800> when<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.100> go<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.280> certain<00:04:13.610> spots<00:04:13.880> and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
actions when you go to certain spots and

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.720 
actions when you go to certain spots and
they<00:04:15.140> guess<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:15.410> they're<00:04:15.590> really<00:04:15.800> only<00:04:16.130> usable

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
they guess so they're really only usable

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.370 
they guess so they're really only usable
with<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.090> expansion<00:04:17.750> but<00:04:18.049> that's<00:04:18.200> what<00:04:18.290> the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
with the expansion but that's what the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.880 
with the expansion but that's what the
expansion<00:04:18.770> adds<00:04:19.720> alright<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:20.840> here<00:04:20.989> was<00:04:21.170> my<00:04:21.200> my

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
expansion adds alright so here was my my

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.530 
expansion adds alright so here was my my
initial<00:04:22.220> impression<00:04:22.640> was<00:04:22.670> largely<00:04:23.180> what<00:04:23.510> we

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
initial impression was largely what we

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.310 
initial impression was largely what we
just<00:04:23.870> said<00:04:24.140> which<00:04:25.100> was<00:04:25.400> I'm<00:04:26.150> not<00:04:26.210> sure<00:04:26.630> what

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
just said which was I'm not sure what

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.470 
just said which was I'm not sure what
this<00:04:27.440> expansion<00:04:28.100> could<00:04:28.340> possibly<00:04:28.850> bring<00:04:29.210> to

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
this expansion could possibly bring to

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.140 
this expansion could possibly bring to
the<00:04:29.660> table<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.110> at<00:04:30.170> first<00:04:30.410> blush<00:04:30.920> I<00:04:31.340> thought

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
the table and at first blush I thought

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.820 
the table and at first blush I thought
okay<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:32.570> basically<00:04:32.900> what<00:04:33.140> they're<00:04:33.350> doing<00:04:33.740> is

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
okay so basically what they're doing is

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.540 
okay so basically what they're doing is
they're<00:04:33.980> adding<00:04:34.990> basically<00:04:36.130> twice<00:04:37.130> as<00:04:37.400> many

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
they're adding basically twice as many

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.280 
they're adding basically twice as many
they<00:04:37.790> have<00:04:37.910> twice<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.240> many<00:04:38.480> options<00:04:38.840> now

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
they have twice as many options now

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.840 
they have twice as many options now
every<00:04:39.890> single<00:04:40.250> thing<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.460> could<00:04:40.640> do<00:04:40.730> before

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
every single thing you could do before

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.270 
every single thing you could do before
you<00:04:41.690> can<00:04:41.840> now<00:04:41.990> do<00:04:42.050> two<00:04:42.560> things<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:43.100> is

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
you can now do two things that is

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.970 
you can now do two things that is
literally<00:04:44.060> twice<00:04:44.240> as<00:04:44.480> many<00:04:44.630> things<00:04:44.990> which

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
literally twice as many things which

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.490 
literally twice as many things which
concerns<00:04:46.670> me<00:04:46.880> because<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.360> feel<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.810> pushes<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
concerns me because I feel it pushes the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.820 
concerns me because I feel it pushes the
game<00:04:48.770> out<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.570> where<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.870> lived<00:04:51.200> which<00:04:51.560> was

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
game out of where it lived which was

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.040 
game out of where it lived which was
great<00:04:52.670> game<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:53.060> non-gamers<00:04:53.690> great

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
great game for non-gamers great

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.340 
great game for non-gamers great
introductory<00:04:54.730> gateway<00:04:55.730> style<00:04:56.150> game<00:04:56.420> with<00:04:57.020> now

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
introductory gateway style game with now

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.940 
introductory gateway style game with now
too<00:04:57.410> much<00:04:57.980> however<00:04:58.990> stepping<00:04:59.990> back<00:05:00.260> from<00:05:00.620> that

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
too much however stepping back from that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.080 
too much however stepping back from that
observation<00:05:01.790> for<00:05:02.690> me<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:04.070> makes<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.610> better

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
observation for me this makes a better

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.570 
observation for me this makes a better
game<00:05:05.390> I<00:05:05.690> don't<00:05:06.650> know<00:05:06.710> what<00:05:06.890> I<00:05:06.920> can<00:05:07.130> say<00:05:07.340> now

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
game I don't know what I can say now

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.370 
game I don't know what I can say now
since<00:05:07.880> Xena<00:05:08.210> said<00:05:08.420> exactly<00:05:08.750> really<00:05:09.230> what<00:05:09.350> I

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
since Xena said exactly really what I

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.320 
since Xena said exactly really what I
thought<00:05:09.680> too<00:05:09.920> and<00:05:10.460> in<00:05:10.670> fact<00:05:10.880> this<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.180> one<00:05:11.300> of

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
thought too and in fact this is one of

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.670 
thought too and in fact this is one of
those<00:05:11.420> times<00:05:11.660> where<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:11.900> would<00:05:11.960> deliberately

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
those times where I would deliberately

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.560 
those times where I would deliberately
keep<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:13.190> expansion<00:05:13.610> separate<00:05:14.300> from<00:05:14.480> the

keep this expansion separate from the

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
we play the bass game with them and not

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.950 
we play the bass game with them and not

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
throw this in the mix because it does

you're like should I go there and then

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.890 
you're like should I go there and then
I'll<00:05:32.490> pick<00:05:32.580> up<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.789> stack<00:05:32.969> of<00:05:32.999> cards<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.809> look

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
I'll pick up the stack of cards and look

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.390 
I'll pick up the stack of cards and look
through<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.110> second<00:05:34.409> car<00:05:34.589> to<00:05:35.009> pick<00:05:35.159> one<00:05:35.309> of

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
through that second car to pick one of

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.100 
through that second car to pick one of
those<00:05:35.490> that's<00:05:36.029> a<00:05:36.120> whole<00:05:36.389> lot<00:05:36.599> more<00:05:36.749> options

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
those that's a whole lot more options

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.629 
those that's a whole lot more options
but<00:05:37.259> actually<00:05:37.589> more<00:05:37.919> than<00:05:38.129> doubles<00:05:38.550> the

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
but actually more than doubles the

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.700 
but actually more than doubles the
options<00:05:38.999> it<00:05:39.689> does<00:05:39.900> because<00:05:40.169> there<00:05:40.319> are<00:05:40.439> stacks

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
options it does because there are stacks

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.260 
options it does because there are stacks
you<00:05:40.889> can<00:05:41.039> look<00:05:41.400> through<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.699> pick<00:05:41.939> the<00:05:42.059> one

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
you can look through and pick the one

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.820 
you can look through and pick the one
card<00:05:42.599> you<00:05:42.659> need<00:05:42.900> yes<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:43.469> then<00:05:43.589> you<00:05:43.650> have

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
card you need yes and then you have

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.860 
card you need yes and then you have
those<00:05:43.979> cards<00:05:44.249> that<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:44.639> can<00:05:44.849> play<00:05:45.089> right<00:05:45.569> so

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
those cards that you can play right so

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.450 
those cards that you can play right so
when's<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.139> best<00:05:46.199> time<00:05:46.319> to<00:05:46.469> play<00:05:46.710> up<00:05:46.919> so<00:05:47.339> it

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
when's the best time to play up so it

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.549 
when's the best time to play up so it
makes<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:47.819> much<00:05:48.089> more<00:05:48.330> gamer<00:05:48.689> it's<00:05:48.990> not<00:05:49.139> heavy

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.559 
makes it much more gamer it's not heavy

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:51.920 
makes it much more gamer it's not heavy
game<00:05:49.889> amazing<00:05:50.789> but<00:05:51.270> it's<00:05:51.449> it's<00:05:51.870> very

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
different I agree I think it's a good

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.129 
different I agree I think it's a good
observation<00:05:54.419> this<00:05:54.509> is<00:05:54.659> not<00:05:54.839> one<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.020> those

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
observation this is not one of those

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.159 
observation this is not one of those
expansions<00:05:55.559> you<00:05:55.949> say<00:05:56.219> ooh<00:05:56.719> more<00:05:57.719> good<00:05:57.930> stuff

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:00.809 
throw it right in no and in fact there's

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:02.659 
throw it right in no and in fact there's
people<00:06:00.990> who<00:06:01.199> might<00:06:01.439> not<00:06:01.589> be<00:06:01.800> interested<00:06:02.490> in

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
people who might not be interested in

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.369 
people who might not be interested in
this<00:06:02.939> in<00:06:03.210> making<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.409> game<00:06:04.830> experience<00:06:06.379> more

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
this in making that game experience more

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.369 
this in making that game experience more
complicated<00:06:08.249> giving<00:06:08.819> their<00:06:09.360> players<00:06:09.749> more

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
complicated giving their players more

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.040 
complicated giving their players more
options<00:06:11.069> but<00:06:11.370> if<00:06:11.490> you<00:06:11.699> are<00:06:12.210> a<00:06:12.270> gamer<00:06:12.659> if<00:06:12.930> you

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
people are gonna like this expansion

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.329 
people are gonna like this expansion
maybe<00:06:48.659> it's<00:06:48.870> a<00:06:48.990> next<00:06:49.349> step<00:06:49.499> thing<00:06:49.770> -<00:06:49.949> someone

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:50.339 
maybe it's a next step thing - someone

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:51.739 
maybe it's a next step thing - someone
gets<00:06:50.520> in<00:06:50.639> the<00:06:50.729> gaming<00:06:50.939> matsukata<00:06:51.360> they<00:06:51.599> buy

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:51.749 
gets in the gaming matsukata they buy

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:53.329 
gets in the gaming matsukata they buy
this<00:06:51.809> like<00:06:51.959> gaming<00:06:52.680> it's<00:06:52.860> bigger<00:06:53.009> than<00:06:53.219> I

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:53.339 
this like gaming it's bigger than I

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.679 
this like gaming it's bigger than I
thought<00:06:53.520> so<00:06:53.729> there's<00:06:54.240> that<00:06:54.419> possibility

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:54.689 
thought so there's that possibility

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.260 
thought so there's that possibility
anyway<00:06:55.649> it's<00:06:55.919> still<00:06:56.129> very<00:06:56.309> there's<00:06:56.849> a<00:06:56.939> lot<00:06:57.149> of

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
anyway it's still very there's a lot of

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.850 
anyway it's still very there's a lot of
expansion<00:06:57.569> here<00:06:57.870> really<00:06:58.139> for<00:06:58.439> such<00:06:58.559> a<00:06:58.589> small

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
expansion here really for such a small

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.219 
expansion here really for such a small
