00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
alright so you know that he kind of

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.290 
alright so you know that he kind of
breezed<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.930> lot<00:04:30.170> it's<00:04:30.950> kind<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.340> like<00:04:31.460> he<00:04:31.640> he<00:04:32.060> it

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
breezed a lot it's kind of like he he it

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.030 
breezed a lot it's kind of like he he it
feels<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:32.810> he<00:04:32.960> has<00:04:32.990> he's<00:04:33.440> gonna<00:04:33.770> have<00:04:34.010> a

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
feels like he has he's gonna have a

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.610 
feels like he has he's gonna have a
heart<00:04:34.310> attack<00:04:34.400> or<00:04:34.850> something<00:04:35.500> all<00:04:36.500> right

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
heart attack or something all right

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.160 
heart attack or something all right
there<00:04:36.770> he<00:04:36.950> is<00:04:36.980> he's<00:04:37.340> kind<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.610> meditating<00:04:38.300> why

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
there he is he's kind of meditating why

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.230 
there he is he's kind of meditating why
I<00:04:39.530> guess<00:04:40.010> that's<00:04:40.190> why<00:04:40.310> he<00:04:40.490> needs<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.790> meditate

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
I guess that's why he needs to meditate

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.210 
I guess that's why he needs to meditate
because<00:04:41.600> he's<00:04:42.110> gonna<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.860> heart<00:04:43.100> attack

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
because he's gonna have a heart attack

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.650 
because he's gonna have a heart attack
or<00:04:43.400> something<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.000> then<00:04:44.090> he<00:04:44.180> slashes<00:04:44.480> the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
or something and then he slashes the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.960 
or something and then he slashes the
bamboo<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:45.500> then<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.280> kind<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.490> flings<00:04:46.820> it

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970
