00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
and then cut off the tail if you're

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.310 
and then cut off the tail if you're
using<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.980> leaf<00:05:17.160> without<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.700> edging<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.330> will

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
using a leaf without the edging you will

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.050 
using a leaf without the edging you will
take<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.800> attach<00:05:20.100> it<00:05:20.430> wherever<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.330> want<00:05:21.389> it

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.250 
take and attach it wherever you want it
maybe<00:05:24.060> want<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.480> up<00:05:24.600> here<00:05:24.870> a<00:05:24.900> little<00:05:25.050> bit

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
maybe want it up here a little bit

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.030 
maybe want it up here a little bit
higher<00:05:25.530> on<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.830> stem<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.880> then<00:05:27.750> just<00:05:28.139> start

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
higher on the stem and then just start

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.720 
higher on the stem and then just start
sewing<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.610> down<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:31.470> I'm<00:05:31.830> using<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.400> tail

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
sewing it down and I'm using the tail

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:40.870 
sewing it down and I'm using the tail
that<00:05:33.180> was<00:05:33.300> from<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.570> beginning<00:05:33.690> of<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.169> leaf

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:50.740 

my<00:05:41.880> tail<00:05:42.180> was<00:05:42.330> not<00:05:42.540> very<00:05:42.810> long

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.900 

and<00:05:51.290> I<00:05:51.410> think<00:05:51.650> that's<00:05:51.890> pretty<00:05:52.160> good<00:05:52.490> so<00:05:52.760> I'm

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
and I think that's pretty good so I'm

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.630 
and I think that's pretty good so I'm
going<00:05:53.120> to<00:05:53.470> flip<00:05:54.470> it<00:05:54.590> on<00:05:54.740> around<00:05:54.770> here<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.520> the

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
going to flip it on around here to the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:12.820 
going to flip it on around here to the
backside

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:21.440 

I'm<00:06:13.490> going<00:06:13.730> to<00:06:13.820> make<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.150> knot

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.930 

and<00:06:21.840> then<00:06:22.230> weave<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:23.100> tail<00:06:23.310> between<00:06:23.610> the

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
and then weave the tail between the

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:32.210 
and then weave the tail between the
stitches

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.230 

and<00:06:32.790> then<00:06:32.970> cut<00:06:33.240> off<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.570> yarn<00:06:33.600> you<00:06:34.970> can<00:06:35.970> decide

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
and then cut off the yarn you can decide

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.260 
and then cut off the yarn you can decide
if<00:06:36.360> you<00:06:36.450> want<00:06:36.660> to<00:06:36.810> sew<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.170> leaf<00:06:37.350> down<00:06:37.760> or<00:06:38.760> let

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
if you want to sew the leaf down or let

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:49.620 
if you want to sew the leaf down or let
it<00:06:39.300> move<00:06:39.540> around<00:06:39.690> freely<00:06:40.200> that's<00:06:40.890> up<00:06:41.100> to<00:06:41.280> you

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.690 

you
