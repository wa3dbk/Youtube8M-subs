come video we have news from Intel and
we<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.340> updates<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.330> brief<00:00:09.840> roared<00:00:10.769> well

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.540 
it wants some of the pie basically and
so<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> be<00:02:34.890> pushing<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so it's going to be pushing that so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.650 
so it's going to be pushing that so
although<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.450> exactly

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
although it's not going to be exactly

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.680 
although it's not going to be exactly
equal<00:02:37.490> they<00:02:38.490> are<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.120> pushing<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.600> to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
equal they are going to be pushing it to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.330 
equal they are going to be pushing it to
the<00:02:39.750> point<00:02:40.080> where<00:02:40.350> they're<00:02:40.770> on<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> much<00:02:41.160> more

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the point where they're on a much more

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.450 
the point where they're on a much more
level<00:02:41.670> playing<00:02:41.700> field<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> what<00:02:44.280> they're

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
level playing field so what they're

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.150 
level playing field so what they're
doing<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:45.000> pushing<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:46.350> leading<00:02:46.950> no

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
doing is now pushing for leading no

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.810 
doing is now pushing for leading no
technology<00:02:47.670> they're<00:02:48.240> no<00:02:48.390> longer<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.470> a
