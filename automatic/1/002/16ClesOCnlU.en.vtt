00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.670
 very good to all guys and girls and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260
 welcome back to the seitor channel and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.840
 Valbuena and here I bring you the special 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.000
 characters of lego star wars 3 the clone 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.160
 wars as I promised you and what is promised is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.619
 debt here you have it so I'm going to spend 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
 to show you all the characters I 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.039
 I will teach them in the following way 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.079
 that is , number 1, I'm not going to 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.339
 teach full body because because 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.480
 this game has a system a little bit 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.220
 strange when choosing the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.079
 characters you have to choose them from the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 central panel of the console you have to 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.810
 load you have to put them and this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 It would take a long time to make an edition 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.560
 and for this reason because now 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 I do not have too much time to do 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.700
 this type of editions I'm going to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.320
 teach directly like that in one in one of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900
 right from left to right and from 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.680
 right to left I hope you tell me 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.810
 on the comments 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 what are your favorite characters and 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.070
 why do you like mine so much is late and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.350
 later I like the dark side and if I 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.700
 like wood and well here we have the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.890
 old acquaintance who asks you what 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.470
 said is what it was called party kit in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 concrete is called the gentleman but hey 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.579
 let's move on to the second row and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.409
 little by little it will be happening to the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 I'm having a lot of characters 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.280
 fast because most of them and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 We know if you want to see it with more 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 luxury 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.360
 details, you just have to pause the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.610
 video and enjoy all the time that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 you want them in the bottom 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.000
 of the video sorry at the bottom in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.590
 the back in the last row 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 you are watching a row with silhouettes 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.170
 black these silhouettes are reserved 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 for the character editor like them 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.280
 we have a lot of reserved slots 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 so we could create a lot of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 characters if we wanted and in these 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 moments I do not have any created because 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 good because I did not feel like creating myself 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.430
 none but if you want to do it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 you can do it from this ship where 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.030
 we found there is a room in the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.039
 back that allows us to create 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.840
 characters and some can be very 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.009
 pimps I will not show you any 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.390
 because I do not plan to do a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.850
 special of these of this 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.440
 of this editor in particular but good if 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.030
 you want to do it is very easy 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.909
 you go around the ship and you find 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.550
 the safe room let's continue 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.020
 happening a little more and as you see 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.940
 some are very cool but the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.070
 best will come from one moment to another 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.630
 which are the classic characters that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.729
 find in the last two rows if 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.260
 I do not remember badly therefore we are going to 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.720
 spend this a little bit quick because 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.420
 I really want to show you those 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.580
 characters and I take the opportunity to tell you and 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.860
 to remind you that next week I will 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.270
 I'm going to teach that I'm going to upload you two 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.520
 specials of laymen the hobbits god 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.680
 was a how to create characters and the 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.260
 another is how to modify the color of 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.850
 animals agree and after this 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.709
 I will start with my new series that will be the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.420
 lego indiana jones that many of you have 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.459
 asked and apart I also have many 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.380
 I want to play melo because that game 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.970
 I had a great time 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.709
 a lot of time and I do not remember 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.120
 absolutely nothing yes it was 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.980
 pretty short so it's going to be a 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.739
 very short series but once the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.360
 let's finish up, came batman and 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.489
 subsequently of lego batman also 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.260
 I will go up lego indiana jones 2 of agreement 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.620
 so the thing will be then in flame 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.330
 jones then batman came and then 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.830
 jones 2 agree to vary a 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.750
 little bit of so much lega indiana jones 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.370
 Now I do believe that they are going to be series that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.290
 you're going to like it a lot once it's just 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.290
 upload these series I thought maybe 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.640
 there is one or several specials of all 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.760
 the lego games that you have been uploading to 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.379
 over time according to the two 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.030
 only lego games that I will not upload 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.980
 they're going to be lego rock band because they do not 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.560
 I have and because it's a musical game 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.450
 brings nothing to nothing of adventures or anything 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 for style and the second game that does not 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.560
 I 'm going to upload but I would love it but 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.390
 obviously it's exclusive to wii and me 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.640
 I do not have wow and I will not buy a 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.349
 console just for a game would be lego 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.299
 city under cover this game I'm not going 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.609
 to be able to climb is a pity I know but 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.109
 I'm not going to spend 300 euros on a 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.390
 video game console just to upload them a 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.739
 series although it tastes bad not me but I 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.079
 I would like very much to share that series with 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.299
 you but it will not be able to be 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.129
 feeling it a lot and we are about to 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.359
 get to the classic characters I speak 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.180
 so much that I did not notice if I passed 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.159
 some already but I think here they come 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.859

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.440

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.410
 my favorite characters without any 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.900
 I doubt I remember you again I hope that I 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.010
 say in the comments 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.450

 comments which are yours 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.910
 favorite characters and the reason for 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.440

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.789
 step if you wait with desire the new 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.280
 ego series that as has already been said 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.810
 will be lega indiana jones a game that already 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.389
 Strong was the first that came out of 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.460
 laymen and I do not remember badly was the second or 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.530
 the third one that came out because first 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.479
 left lego star wars 2 and then I think that 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.460
 came out this layman indiana jones correct and 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.150
 then left lego indiana sorry then 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.979
 left lego star wars lego star wars 3 or 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.630
 that is to say the game that came with the 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.700
 complete saga no 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.650

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.390
 see how you see some of the last ones are 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.590

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.940
 all that is down in the all to the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.920
 right now you are going to see it in a 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.780
 moment and toxic here we have darth 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.750
 This damaged vader is also from my 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.390
 favorites and not that I say of my favorites 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.100

 that little has been taken out but 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.390

 abc etcetera etcetera are 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.530
 reserved for the characters that are created 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.650
 in the character editor and last 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.060
