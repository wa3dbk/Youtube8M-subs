00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.980
 surprises purely Russian such as for now I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.320
 tell a European who thanks 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 cars themselves registered to stubbornness 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.350
 your dream ben khalid dude who 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.969
 bought a real plane that is a business in 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.760
 1974 release or rather his fezyulyazha 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.740
 sparks and turned wah chic limousine 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 called him lima jed 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 graduation weddings corporate parties is something 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.280
 can only be rented in chicago to him 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 buy this thing worth a million bucks and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 flight attendants not included 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 not bad business dude muddied with 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.659
 planes yes at least suggest 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 denied all this rather and here on this 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 Here it all is said here as 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.579
 the plane must fly you know fly 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.409
 they drive like a car this is illogical 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.210
 understand illogical not like that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.820
 illogical like a train 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 yacht train i'm the author understand and if this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 illogical it means it can not be 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.490
 true 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.740
 yes yes yes you are right but I want my 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.180
 rating understand guy in these classes 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.180
 in Odessa classes 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.190
 using a walk way logic to undermine 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.380
 answer without thinking who wants to be 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.750
 passive every man on earth batman 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.580
 correct it is difficult to realize this dream but 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 for a hundred thousand bucks at least 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.050
 you can go to work like florida 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 firm pepper and manually built lunch 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.410
 under like from a dark knight 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.270
 here is their website and landing can buy bad 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.840
 under it certainly differs from 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.580
 of the original 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 only that he has room for 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 numbers rearview mirror and stop 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.540
 signals to what the real batman was 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 spit deep inside his chassis then 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.110
 admission on the result 50 cubes 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.210
 so if the salute of this batman is 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.320
 driving trouble then and being real then 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.600
 which are in real 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.560
 and the difference is certainly palpable 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.400
 see this beta 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.080
 and it will work out not stupid again and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.210
 let be 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.540
 bryndin beta again 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.939
 but again he went to the sea 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.280
 Well, as if yes a sump a little bit when 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.439
 notice until the difference is of course fit 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.030
 on the walls to drive letters are unlikely to succeed 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.890
 but you don't have to ride 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.510
 like this bald man on video dash 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.409
 board pushed forward could 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.329
 there is already an even cooler bike 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.760
 one that a film in the morning he stands still 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.159
 cheaper than 55 thousand bucks it all 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810
 really inexpensive children only 55 pieces 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.760
 bucks you get a live embodiment 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.590
 computer program or rather 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.939
 drawn by a motorcycle which 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.060
 never supposed to do 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.700
 real absolutely working motie strictly 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.310
 with wheels without axles of hard tires 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.739
 for trucks and cool neon inside 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.319
 shaft work such a thing on electricity 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.359
 charges in half an hour and passes 150 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.609
 kilometers plus everything you can 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.109
 buy the costumes of the countries 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.180
 motorcycle rider suit who 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.889
 glow with such a quote and such 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.439
 a motorcycle any everyday task 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.919
 becomes a heroic superhero and 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.299
 houses 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.370
 if you have such a motorcycle you 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.230
 be sure to behave like this 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.689
 we have no milk who will go for milk 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.540
 pits i understand need to pick up grandma from 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:01.620
 hospital jam where they go pick up now 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.729
 there is no bread, I now go on 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.750
 intergalactic skill giving saucer 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.639
 strollers engineers teacher floor 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.609
 Moller has spent 40 years in order to 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.870
 build a flying machine and built and 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.000
 called her moller international 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.190
 p and the strangest that judging by the pictures 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.820
 boiler not only reinvent and engineer but 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.199
 and the most dissatisfied customer own 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.910
 companies but it is used for landing 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.800
 a bunch of vertical screws so she and 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.330
 different from other flying machines 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.639
 raise the plate to the maximum 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.470
 height of 3 meters well, well at least fences 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.060
 it will be possible to fly us 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.280
 But here on roads she can fly and 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.320
 say what 10 liters per hour is 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.710
 perfect speed just perfect 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.490
 speed in order to glow from 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.370
 cheetah yes you guessed it all that 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.130
 it was up to this little thing really all 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:05:04.150
 we want all the damn to drive through the streets 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:05:09.330
 cities but then when now I donâ€™t 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:15.600
 affairs i need coffee and a hamburger here 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.600
 likes then I guessed your desires 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.409
 Moreover in Russia you can straight 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.050
 buy a tank now and charge it 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.090
 as a vehicle, but for example 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.560
 site where you can buy for a million three hundred 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.080
 bt to real but over just bought 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.629
 took an ordinary tank gone maybe 500 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.669
 thousand rubles would be powerful for 300 well with 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.039
 the presence of giant units take eggs 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.819

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.509
 bread easy reconnaissance tanks safe in 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.610
 1974 release 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.560
 This machine actually visited the fighting in 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.449
 askew you might have killed hundreds of people a 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.419
 now harsh Englishman rides on not for 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.120
 tea is cool but everyone is interested in smoke 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.800

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.849
 vehicle stylish 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.639

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.219
 lining the truck and deactivating the gun i 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.860
 I understand now you say hy chair 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:21.330
