and etc etc etc anyway so let me go
ahead<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.840> start<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.590> conventional

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
ahead and start with my conventional

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.020 
ahead and start with my conventional
panel<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> my<00:00:36.930> syenite<00:00:37.620> sk2<00:00:38.129> file

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
panel this here is my syenite sk2 file

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.110 
panel this here is my syenite sk2 file
our<00:00:39.210> control<00:00:39.570> panel<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:40.020> conventional<00:00:41.120> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
our control panel that's conventional it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.470 
our control panel that's conventional it
has<00:00:42.500> 1n<00:00:43.500> AC<00:00:43.800> circuit<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.640> two<00:00:45.180> zones

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
has 1n AC circuit and two zones

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
has 1n AC circuit and two zones
basically<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> need<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> control

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
basically if you need for a control

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
basically if you need for a control
panel<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.780> definitely<00:00:52.289> recommend

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
panel I would definitely recommend

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.160 
panel I would definitely recommend
starting<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.100> conventional<00:00:53.399> panel

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
starting with a conventional panel

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.240 
starting with a conventional panel
because<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.440> easy<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.920> work<00:00:56.039> with

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
because it's very easy to work with

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
because it's very easy to work with
especially<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.699> Cylon<00:00:57.030> sk2<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
especially the Cylon sk2 because the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
especially the Cylon sk2 because the
programming<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.739> done<00:00:58.920> by<00:00:59.180> these<00:01:00.180> dip

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
programming is done by these dip

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.130 
programming is done by these dip
switches<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.899> you're<00:01:04.049> going

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to need to start off with the fire alarm

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.170

I<00:02:09.170> haven't<00:02:10.170> done<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> thank<00:02:10.679> goodness<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
I haven't done it thank goodness but you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.730 
I haven't done it thank goodness but you
will<00:02:11.819> electrocute<00:02:12.150> yourself

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
will electrocute yourself

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.630 
will electrocute yourself
anyway<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.010> next<00:02:15.220> thing<00:02:15.340> you're<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.580> to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
anyway the next thing you're going to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.580 
anyway the next thing you're going to
need<00:02:15.819> is<00:02:17.430> fire<00:02:18.430> alarm<00:02:18.700> wire<00:02:18.940> or<00:02:19.270> any<00:02:20.140> type<00:02:20.410> of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
need is fire alarm wire or any type of

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.070 
need is fire alarm wire or any type of
wire<00:02:20.800> pretty<00:02:21.220> much<00:02:21.400> my<00:02:22.240> recommendation<00:02:22.900> is

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
wire pretty much my recommendation is

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.150 
wire pretty much my recommendation is
using<00:02:23.560> solid<00:02:24.220> stranded<00:02:24.610> wiring<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.920> use<00:02:26.920> in

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
using solid stranded wiring to use in

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.970 
using solid stranded wiring to use in
your<00:02:27.310> control<00:02:27.670> panel

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
your control panel

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.100 
your control panel
so<00:02:29.980> solid<00:02:30.430> wiring<00:02:30.820> helps<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.450> make<00:02:31.959> it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
so solid wiring helps make make it

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.320 
so solid wiring helps make make it
easier<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.620> loop<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.610> wire<00:02:33.760> into<00:02:34.300> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
easier to loop the wire into the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.790 
easier to loop the wire into the
terminals<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.900> can<00:02:38.050> power<00:02:38.200> up<00:02:38.320> your<00:02:38.590> fire

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
terminals so you can power up your fire

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.920 
terminals so you can power up your fire
your<00:02:39.070> power<00:02:39.250> up<00:02:39.370> your<00:02:39.520> horns<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.090> your<00:02:40.360> whole

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
your power up your horns and your whole

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.360 
your power up your horns and your whole

currently set to zero zero zero is this
a<00:05:58.599> 2-1<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.560> think<00:05:59.860> it's<00:05:59.949> I<00:06:00.039> think<00:06:00.069> I<00:06:00.250> said<00:06:00.430> to

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
a 2-1 I think it's I think I said to

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.730 
a 2-1 I think it's I think I said to
entwine<00:06:00.639> yeah<00:06:01.389> I<00:06:01.690> don't<00:06:02.259> have<00:06:02.409> to<00:06:02.529> look

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
entwine yeah I don't have to look

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.399 
entwine yeah I don't have to look
closely<00:06:03.219> in<00:06:03.460> order<00:06:03.669> for<00:06:03.879> it<00:06:03.969> that<00:06:04.750> I<00:06:04.990> actually

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
closely in order for it that I actually

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.260 
closely in order for it that I actually
understand<00:06:05.919> which<00:06:06.039> one<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:06.279> is<00:06:06.400> but<00:06:07.120> that's

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
understand which one it is but that's

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.269 
understand which one it is but that's
actually<00:06:07.659> how<00:06:07.779> you<00:06:07.810> program<00:06:08.229> an<00:06:08.830> addressable

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
actually how you program an addressable

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.360 
actually how you program an addressable
point<00:06:09.580> is<00:06:09.729> by<00:06:10.379> setting<00:06:11.379> the<00:06:11.529> dip<00:06:11.680> switches<00:06:11.949> to

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
point is by setting the dip switches to

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.360 
point is by setting the dip switches to
the<00:06:12.779> address<00:06:13.779> and<00:06:14.139> then<00:06:14.529> program<00:06:14.919> the<00:06:15.069> address

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
the address and then program the address

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.129 
the address and then program the address
to<00:06:15.550> say<00:06:15.879> what<00:06:16.090> it<00:06:16.180> actually<00:06:16.479> is<00:06:16.659> so<00:06:16.690> this<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.110> a

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
to say what it actually is so this is a

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.649 
to say what it actually is so this is a
pull<00:06:17.379> station<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:18.009> whenever<00:06:18.610> I<00:06:18.789> pull<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.449> pull

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
pull station so whenever I pull the pull

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.189 
pull station so whenever I pull the pull
station<00:06:20.110> it<00:06:20.319> says<00:06:21.190> pull<00:06:22.000> station<00:06:22.479> firewall

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
station it says pull station firewall

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.769 
station it says pull station firewall
basically<00:06:24.180> because<00:06:25.180> this<00:06:25.300> is<00:06:25.449> the<00:06:25.509> location

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
basically because this is the location

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.080 
basically because this is the location
it's<00:06:26.050> on<00:06:26.110> my<00:06:26.229> firewall<00:06:28.319> anyway

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
it's on my firewall anyway

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.160 
it's on my firewall anyway
that's<00:06:32.090> pretty<00:06:32.240> much<00:06:32.360> all<00:06:32.540> you<00:06:32.720> need<00:06:32.750> to<00:06:32.990> know

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
that's pretty much all you need to know

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.810 
that's pretty much all you need to know
