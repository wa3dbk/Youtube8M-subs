00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.880
 all there is a plastic retainer 3 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.220

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.990
 equipment now go to our 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.100
 models which were my first impressions 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.180
 about this device first 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.649
 the smartphone is really very cool 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 he looks pretty big 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.820
 screen but still pretty 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.090
 small case is allowed compared to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.010
 my same 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.489
 u g2 will show you four 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.110
 an inch 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:27.150
 see the centimeter difference in height and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:30.010
 literally there are 4 millimeters wide 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.260
 the thickness of the smartphone is also very impressive 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.930
 compact model in general design for me 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.849
 I really liked the smartphone very much 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.660
 dark good screen stylishly solid 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.390
 The body also looks here without any complaints 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.860
 here is matte soft-touch plastic all 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.660
 the buttons are pretty comfortable 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.599
 on / off button 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.739
 volume 5 or rather the rocker on top of us 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.000
 second speaker 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.160
 second microphone jack for headphones 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.849
 front we have front camera sensors 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.500
 lighting proximity speaker sensors 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.150
 there are no touch buttons here 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.350
 are located right here right below the screen 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.290
 below we have speakers and usb connector 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:18.880
 cable hitting the main camera at 13 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.690
 megapixels flash nexus logo and here 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.010
 logo and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.440
 aljay similar so what happened 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.049
 further natural smartphone 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.049
 inside a really cool screen 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.280
 very cool assembled this model to 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.459
 you all understood on a snapdragon processor 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.500
 800 with all relevant 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:46.389
 technical characteristics here fouls 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.410
 wait here 8 camera 2 giga pirates here 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.150
 snapdragon and this adreno 330 that is 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.799
 real processor frequency in the range 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.489
 300 2265 processor is just very 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.849
 495 serious diagonal smartphone 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.889
 ips-matrix I started to like everything 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.690
 of ours, so I deal with it 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:11.889
 the smartphone began to test it 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.760
 and here I understand that firstly the smartphone 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.769
 absolutely no sound 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.090
 absolutely not where it is i can go to 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.980
 profile and sound and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.620
 try to include some 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.040
 melody 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 try to include some kind of ringtone 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.729
 nothing sounds like 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.800
 further I thought there might be a voice recorder 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.919
 when we want to record our voice 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.740
 then there is the same problem that is both 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.410
 still so superficially what I 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.400
 just managed to watch it here youtube 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.570
 Now my smartphone is connected to Wi-Fi 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.210
 youtube just i want to watch 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.020
 some video video just just me 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.790
 does not start 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.550
 Well, I think that this firmware 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.630
 what needs to be changed although it is worth it 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.100
 android 4 4 version android 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.479
 system update is also available here 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.560
 however this is an update I have to install 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:20.000
 It did not work, that is, such sensations 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.090
 I am twofold I really hope that all these 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.180
 moments of improvement and renewal and these all 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.650
 errors will disappear with the advent of the new 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.810
 firmware more precisely after we 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.150
 We will ask him another firmware also when 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.580
 inserted headphones not music does not sound not 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.720
 headphones icon does not appear any where that 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.389
 Well, there is something for the firmware 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.099
 some kind of rubbish got 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.720
 to us this she got us this model for 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.560
 crazy money won't even 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.800
 damn well damn it is very expensive 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.660
 just bought to make you 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.070
 let's say a introductory review for you 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.700
 that's all 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:59.150
 I will continue then when we ask, we 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.490
 and then I will tell you in detail what and 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.349
 like what's right here in this smartphone but by 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.590
 I definitely like the design 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.300
 again I repeat minus these all 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.120
 models is that they are one 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.910
 A sim card would be this model for 2 sim cards 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.280
 I would easily take it with confidence 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.960
 this model for yourself that's all thanks 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.030
