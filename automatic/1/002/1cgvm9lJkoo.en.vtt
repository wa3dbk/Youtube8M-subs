00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.500
 the red pill or the pill 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.260
 fuck a little hard ass battery 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 rif welcome to legends and videogames 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.670
 in his weekly that after thirteen chapters 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.439
 replaces the legends by chickens to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 I think it's a good change to happen 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.980
 started as a project that starter 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.300
 arriving to receive approximately 2 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.579
 million and a half dollars in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.750
 donations of almost 10 thousand people who 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.820
 I would not want a reality device 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.040
 virtual by the price of water and a whole 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 success without a doubt and a future 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.430
 promising until facebook buys a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.470
 company prepared for future 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 news like candy crush simulator or 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.980
 super fan milk 3d 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.720
 in any case happened opens a new 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 world of possibilities in video games and 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.890
 pornography in equal parts but what 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 It happens when someone decides to take everything 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 the project a little beyond him 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 one more turn to the thread and surprise 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.330
 to the world with radical ideas I present to you 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 the project of 'hosting' stuart second 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.500
 life top 1 ass rif or at least one 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.990
 virtual reality device thought 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 only and exclusively for chickens with 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.940
 the purpose that they feel free and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.410
 grow healthier and with less stress 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.410
 I'll give you a while to similes 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.640
 virtual reality 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.900
 and go down randomly that appears in 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.200
 screen 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.610
 a chicken worth less than ten euros 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.909
 one that is worth more than two hundred 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.189
 Dollars 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.869
 it is a lie by luck or by 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.520
 misfortune it is a fake project 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.899
 created for the purpose of consciousness 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.819
 socially by excessive use 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.590
 of electronic gadgets and gadgets 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.609
 some quite unnecessary that the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.859
 inhabitants of developed countries 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.450
 We use everyday but I do not mean 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.039
 internet and youtube are completely 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.689
 essential in the development of 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.979
 our lives to see the news 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.679
 I expected exaggerated reactions 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.329
 news on television in magazines the 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.679
 typical logo that is running naked by 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.380
 the street while you scream the end of 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.789
 world however the exhibition of the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 experiment in chickens has been in 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.599
 certain controversial way but in general 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.159
 quite accepted if there have been 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.709
 discussions there there but neither 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.299
 too much to imagine the reactions of 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.670
 means if the experiment had been in 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.500
 human babies that can grow more 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.229
 healthy and strong in virtual environments 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.970
 the media would have exploded in criticism 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.500
 and complaints and before this gentleman 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.690
 I could explain that it was a joke 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.560
 I would have finished the race forever 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.450
 personally when I see the image of coming 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.120
 to the head a word a concept 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.170
 several movies a video game not very 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.030
 good matrix 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.680
 already have more than 10 years old but in their 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.209
 moment they raised some controversy the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.310
 matrix trilogy is based on the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.599
 simulated reality principle that like 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.130
 its name suggests suggests that what 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.390
 we know how reality is 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.459
 really a simulation so 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.950
 technologically advanced that we are not 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.239
 able to notice any difference 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.650
 maybe it sounds very paranoid and maybe 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.090
 sound like the typical talk that gives you the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.280
 vague world of turn that you cross by the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.500
 street but many reputable scientists 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.060
 they value this theory and each incongruity 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.040
 in calculations every inexplicable phenomenon 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.470
 every mystery of science makes 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.510
 this theory grows stronger it sounds 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.010
 crazy but imagine that a new 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.660
 born they put a reality helmet on 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.430
 virtual with a maximum screen 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.980
 resolution and a suit with sensor 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.390
 Very sophisticated movement the child 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.060
 will grow believing that what he sees in his 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.590
 eyes is real is your world but it would be 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.720
 able to realize that it actually 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.950
 it's about a simulation currently 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.299
 anyone is aware of whether he is 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.430
 using a virtual reality viewer 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.170
 or not especially used only with 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.940
 more than 10 years however the technology 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.410
 advances with giant steps with 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.760
 TVs that exceed the resolution 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.049
 of the human eye and devices 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.489
 virtual reality every day more 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.140
 sophisticated may one day come in 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.200
 that we are not able to differentiate what 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.050
 which is real of what is fictional 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.530
 and with this final reflection we finish and do not 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.739
 forget it the technology is good 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.720
 youtube is your friend that has been all for 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.670
 today if you liked to give it to and 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.500
 subscribe to see upcoming videos 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.709
 a new one every Friday until the week 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.709
 coming
