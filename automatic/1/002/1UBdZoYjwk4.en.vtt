genjutsu<00:01:02.609> mean<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.180> only<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.750> that

genjutsu mean that's only one time that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.440 
genjutsu mean that's only one time that
have<00:01:04.710> passed<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.250> might<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.580> idea<00:01:05.670> but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
have passed it might be an idea but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660 
have passed it might be an idea but
honestly<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.220> fake

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
know why did this they all seem to be

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
know why did this they all seem to be
like<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.590> regular<00:01:26.070> old<00:01:26.130> shin<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.390> old

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
ordinary miss you know bean I was like

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
ordinary miss you know bean I was like
well<00:01:31.049> bloody<00:01:31.320> miss<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.770> me<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.610> felt

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
well bloody miss you know me and I felt

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
well bloody miss you know me and I felt
like<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.240> don't<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.079> could<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.560> don't

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
like I don't think could be I don't

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
like I don't think could be I don't
think<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.250> could<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.460> controlling<00:01:36.030> Kakashi

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
think they could be controlling Kakashi

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
think they could be controlling Kakashi
so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.549> two<00:01:39.060> assumptions<00:01:39.420> either<00:01:40.070> in

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so I have two assumptions either in

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
so I have two assumptions either in
either<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.909> real<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> I'm<00:01:42.960> going

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
either this is real you know I'm going

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
either this is real you know I'm going
for<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.860> guess<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.299> again

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
for that I guess or this is again

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.270 
for that I guess or this is again
jewtube<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.590> no<00:01:46.710> justification<00:01:47.250> for

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
feel like there is somewhat of a

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.930 
feel like there is somewhat of a
correlation<00:03:48.690> between<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:49.049> two<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:50.430> know<00:03:50.549> so

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
correlation between the two you know so

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.990 
correlation between the two you know so
it's<00:03:51.239> like<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:52.280> maybe<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.489> can<00:03:53.639> see<00:03:53.790> through

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
it's like I maybe you can see through

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.970 
it's like I maybe you can see through
kakashi's<00:03:54.419> eyes<00:03:54.569> but<00:03:55.019> maybe<00:03:55.230> Kashia<00:03:55.680> else

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
kakashi's eyes but maybe Kashia else

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.740

will<00:03:56.129> be<00:03:56.250> able<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.489> see<00:03:56.639> through<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.269> I'm

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
will be able to see through that so I'm

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.839 
will be able to see through that so I'm
really<00:03:57.930> wondering<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.799> know<00:03:58.829> but<00:03:59.609> that's
