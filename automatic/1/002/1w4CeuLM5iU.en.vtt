00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.550
 and that there are friends of youtube as they are 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.290
 I hope you are very well because I am 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.629
 very happy to be here again with 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.490
 you and good today we are going to talk about 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.209
 viral photos on the internet that are 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.680
 completely fake well let's start 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.160
 number one behind the scenes of a 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.240
 national geographic production is a 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.519
 fun but has a job 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.310
 photoshop behind users on the network and 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.960
 they comment that the tests are few but 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.599
 the biggest evidence is that the 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.999
 forget a stock photograph in the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.220
 picture you can see both sides sides the 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.690
 shape of the head of the bear and the piece 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.050
 of green grass on his right leg 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.660
 they coincide without a doubt 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.430
 number 2 anti-drug ads are not 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.620
 it's about an advertiser and drugs is a 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.030
 photograph of the doll designer 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.160
 ceramic 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.170
 Its manufacturing method includes putting 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.260
 the feet in the oven someone added the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.399
 anti-drug message to the image 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.019
 normally the process would use in a 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.430
 specialized oven but this version 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.680
 production works for the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.899
 designer although it can be a 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.420
 terrifying image yes I know that if you pull out 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.130
 of context and before you go to the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.259
 comments to let me know that I 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.580
 I said some people this ad 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.409
 you can believe that this announcement has 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.810
 been real 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.270
 number 3 the princess diana without the children 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.859
 obscene is not the diana princess - it's a 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.810
 image of allison's photography 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.030
 jackson famous for spotting people who 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.439
 they look like celebrities the accounts of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.969
 historical photographs of twitter 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.590
 constantly publish images of 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.060
 jackson the platform is full of 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.070
 images of marilyn monroe and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.800
 Kennedy that are work products of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.390
 jackson that's one of them 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.540
 4 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.729
 kitchen chair floating in space 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.130
 This forum is usually used as proof of 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.530
 that there is a kitchen chair floating in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.450
 orbit and that astronauts know her 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.610
 jokingly as an escape vehicle 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.120
 number 6 actually the picture is taken 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 of a toshiba TV ad 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.370
 to no chair floating in space 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.630
 the curious title 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.030
 comes in a work in similar art 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.700
 created by simon the artist explains that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.260
 toshiba even got in touch with 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.910
 He announced that the though never 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.520
 they came to collaborate 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.680
 good number 5 and last einstein 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.400
 riding a bicycle in front of an essay 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.200
 in nuclear is seriously this picture is of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.380
 those so absurd in their approach 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.300
 that seems impossible to believe but there 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.970
 people who believe it and the photo is followed 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.890
 sharing on social networks 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.530
 obviously a simple assembly is false 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.840
 photoshop the photo the authentic photo is 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.630

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.830

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.810
