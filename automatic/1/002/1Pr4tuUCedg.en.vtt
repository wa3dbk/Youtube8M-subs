then you want to move it around usually
near<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> edge<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.960> best<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
near the edge is best so it can kind of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.800 
near the edge is best so it can kind of
give<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> glow<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.159> their<00:01:08.310> face<00:01:08.810> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

give that glow on to their face so
either<00:01:10.020> corner<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> side<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
either corner or off to the side and I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
either corner or off to the side and I
have<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.350> set<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.400> hundred<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
have this one set to one hundred and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999 
have this one set to one hundred and
sixty-five<00:01:15.210> percent<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> be

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
sixty-five percent but you want it to be

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
sixty-five percent but you want it to be
bright<00:01:17.280> enough<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.850> where<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.619> across

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
bright enough to where it's going across

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
bright enough to where it's going across
say<00:01:20.460> their<00:01:20.640> hair<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.570> completely

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
say their hair but not completely

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
say their hair but not completely
covering<00:01:22.470> their<00:01:22.680> face<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
covering their face so you can see the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
covering their face so you can see the
difference<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:24.960> too<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
difference here that's too much so you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
difference here that's too much so you
want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> dial<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.240> back<00:01:27.270> down

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
want to dial it back down

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.090 
want to dial it back down
so<00:01:29.950> about<00:01:30.369> 150<00:01:31.210> 160<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.340> click<00:01:33.909> ok<00:01:34.859> so<00:01:35.859> you<00:01:35.950> can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
so about 150 160 and click ok so you can

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.029 
so about 150 160 and click ok so you can
see<00:01:36.250> ads<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.850> nice<00:01:37.000> little<00:01:37.329> lens<00:01:37.509> flare<00:01:38.039> now

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
see ads the nice little lens flare now

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.330 
see ads the nice little lens flare now
what<00:01:39.670> makes<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:40.090> look<00:01:40.299> fake<00:01:40.600> here<00:01:41.079> is<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
what makes it look fake here is this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.639 
what makes it look fake here is this
bubble<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:43.509> what<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:43.869> want<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.140> do<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.380> remove

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
bubble so what we want to do is remove

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.999 
bubble so what we want to do is remove
that<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:47.079> another<00:01:47.380> reason<00:01:47.560> why<00:01:47.709> we

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
that and that's another reason why we

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.910 
that and that's another reason why we
created<00:01:48.159> two<00:01:48.520> layers<00:01:48.789> here<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.619> we're<00:01:50.829> going

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
created two layers here so we're going

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.800 
created two layers here so we're going
to<00:01:51.009> take<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.310> top<00:01:51.520> layer<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.969> has<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.600> lens

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
to take the top layer that has the lens

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.809 
to take the top layer that has the lens
flare<00:01:53.079> on<00:01:53.109> it<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.859> we're<00:01:54.490> going<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:54.670> add<00:01:54.759> a

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
flare on it and we're going to add a

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.719 
flare on it and we're going to add a
mask<00:01:55.090> onto<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:56.429> now<00:01:57.429> we're<00:01:57.549> going<00:01:57.670> to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
mask onto that and now we're going to

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.870 
mask onto that and now we're going to
take<00:01:57.850> our<00:01:57.909> eraser<00:01:58.270> tool<00:01:58.950> set<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.069> to<00:02:00.189> about<00:02:00.219> 75%

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
take our eraser tool set it to about 75%

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.660 
take our eraser tool set it to about 75%
and<00:02:01.799> we're<00:02:02.799> going<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.069> erase<00:02:03.459> that<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and we're going to erase that and you

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.509 
and we're going to erase that and you
want<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.909> erase<00:02:07.149> real<00:02:07.929> lightly<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:09.130> doesn't

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
want to erase real lightly so it doesn't

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.569 
want to erase real lightly so it doesn't
affect<00:02:09.940> your<00:02:10.269> lens<00:02:10.509> flare<00:02:10.780> above<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.400> want

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579
