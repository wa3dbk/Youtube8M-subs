00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that let's just go over this keyboard is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.370 
that let's just go over this keyboard is
a<00:02:53.459> very<00:02:54.030> nice<00:02:54.270> keyboard<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.840> love<00:02:55.200> this

I love that and it's good the it's just
a<00:03:14.220> pretty<00:03:14.910> much<00:03:15.470> regular<00:03:16.470> core<00:03:16.680> keyboard<00:03:17.160> so

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
a pretty much regular core keyboard so

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.479 
a pretty much regular core keyboard so
it's<00:03:18.150> gonna<00:03:18.300> turn<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.630> on<00:03:22.070> plug<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.250> in

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
it's gonna turn this on plug that in

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.530 
it's gonna turn this on plug that in
there<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.330> boots<00:03:24.630> up<00:03:24.810> very<00:03:25.050> fast<00:03:26.540> it's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
there and this boots up very fast it's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.860 
there and this boots up very fast it's
running<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:29.190> quad-core<00:03:30.060> AMD<00:03:30.590> a8<00:03:31.610> processor

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
running on a quad-core AMD a8 processor

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.220 
running on a quad-core AMD a8 processor
so<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.200> one<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.980> fastest<00:03:36.230> processing

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
so this is one of the fastest processing

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.350 
so this is one of the fastest processing
computers<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:38.040> can<00:03:38.250> buy<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.209> is

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
computers you can buy for this is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.350 
computers you can buy for this is

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
specifically for video editing and audio

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.949 
specifically for video editing and audio
editing<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:43.650> has<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.920> 640<00:03:44.820> gigabyte<00:03:45.570> hard<00:03:45.840> drive

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
editing it has a 640 gigabyte hard drive

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:57.130 
editing it has a 640 gigabyte hard drive
and<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:49.970> 61-44<00:03:50.970> megabyte<00:03:52.910> ddr3<00:03:54.080> sdram<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.310> so

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
and a 61-44 megabyte ddr3 sdram in it so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.039 
and a 61-44 megabyte ddr3 sdram in it so
it's<00:03:58.140> pretty<00:03:58.260> good<00:03:59.090> it's<00:04:00.090> got<00:04:00.209> windows<00:04:00.360> 7<00:04:00.900> home

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
it's pretty good it's got windows 7 home

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.960 
it's pretty good it's got windows 7 home
premium<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:02.640> it's<00:04:03.570> got<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:04.640> 15.6<00:04:05.640> inch

diagonal<00:04:07.340> HD<00:04:08.340> LED<00:04:09.110> display<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.400> is

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
diagonal HD LED display this so this is

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.150 
diagonal HD LED display this so this is
led<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.570> display<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.019> actually<00:04:13.320> led<00:04:13.530> normally

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
led the display is actually led normally

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.710 
led the display is actually led normally
you'll<00:04:14.310> see<00:04:14.519> computers<00:04:14.760> with<00:04:15.000> an<00:04:15.120> LCD<00:04:15.480> monitor

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
you'll see computers with an LCD monitor

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.099 
you'll see computers with an LCD monitor
but<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.900> has<00:04:19.350> an<00:04:19.650> LED<00:04:20.570> monitor<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:21.870> like

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
but this has an LED monitor so it's like

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.879 
but this has an LED monitor so it's like
glass<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.800> know<00:04:22.890> it's

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
glass you know it's

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.770 
glass you know it's
it's<00:04:24.069> not<00:04:24.189> really<00:04:24.430> glass<00:04:24.639> Pino<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.210> has<00:04:25.509> a<00:04:25.539> nice

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
it's not really glass Pino it has a nice

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.070 
it's not really glass Pino it has a nice
monitor<00:04:26.409> so<00:04:27.039> to<00:04:27.699> log<00:04:27.879> in<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.240> do<00:04:28.389> not<00:04:28.539> have<00:04:28.900> to

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
monitor so to log in you do not have to

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.939 
monitor so to log in you do not have to
use<00:04:29.229> fingerprint<00:04:30.449> but<00:04:31.449> you<00:04:31.689> can<00:04:31.870> do<00:04:32.770> whatever

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
use fingerprint but you can do whatever

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.330 
use fingerprint but you can do whatever
you<00:04:33.099> want<00:04:33.250> actually<00:04:33.699> has<00:04:33.849> face<00:04:34.210> recognition

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
you want actually has face recognition

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.909 
you want actually has face recognition
which<00:04:36.340> I'm<00:04:36.729> not<00:04:37.030> sure<00:04:37.300> how<00:04:37.509> to<00:04:37.569> get<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.500> but

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
which I'm not sure how to get that but

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.209 
which I'm not sure how to get that but
so<00:04:39.759> all<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.539> gotta<00:04:40.719> do<00:04:40.900> is<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.740> do<00:04:42.069> this

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
so all you gotta do is you just do this

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.679 
so all you gotta do is you just do this
you<00:04:42.550> just<00:04:43.479> simply<00:04:44.319> swipe<00:04:44.830> over<00:04:45.039> it<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.909> it

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
you just simply swipe over it and it

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.260 
you just simply swipe over it and it
logs<00:04:46.960> right<00:04:47.199> in<00:04:47.379> for<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.009> but<00:04:48.939> of<00:04:49.030> course<00:04:49.210> you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
logs right in for you but of course you

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.790 
logs right in for you but of course you
have<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.449> set<00:04:49.659> this<00:04:49.810> up<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:53.020> logs<00:04:53.319> in<00:04:53.560> very

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
have to set this up and it logs in very

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.249 
have to set this up and it logs in very
fast<00:04:54.069> this<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.789> again<00:04:55.659> this<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:55.900> one<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.139> the

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
fast this is again this is one of the
