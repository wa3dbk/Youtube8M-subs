three<00:01:53.670> spent<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:54.149> spinners<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.509> sure

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
three spent three spinners for sure

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
three spent three spinners for sure

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
signals can be a little dicey because we

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.590
