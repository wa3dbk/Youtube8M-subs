00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.080
 and then my step we will take courage 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.929
 first take all the water out of the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:18.990
 loose hose system will then do 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 straight then pull out the three screws 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.279
 loose distributor whip wire 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 which is 2 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.210
 loose the blog the corner and been vittek and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 of the vittek solenoid probe 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.090
 there ready that side is ready shots 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.090
 connected here right? 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.699
 strip the cap strip all the screw it goes 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.949
 turn away because there below 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.750
 has a screw that holds the block 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.980
 there it is only let it that the exhaust comes 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.650
 take forward this screw bolt 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.420
 of the company in the head only it just does not 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.790
 must take the whole piece only in 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 here screw take out all the screws 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.290
 from here and push a little to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.500
 behind do not need to get him out of the car 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 just push it a little behind 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:33.180
 here you can go there you can see here 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.390
 I have a little hole that is where the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.490
 bolt of the stretcher you will pick up and go 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.210
 loosen the screw will not get it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.479
 he suffers the tea he loosens to run 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.869
 look good molinha she was molinha you 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.909
 pulls it with her own hand at a point 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.680
 screwdriver for the risk of 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.700
 eating strips off valve caps website already 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.140
 know the head bolts will be 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 within the valve cap 2 4 6 8 and 10 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.270
 take this off it was the head exit 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.880
 No mystery, no need to move anymore. 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 nothing to the grinding is better than 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.500
 take out the solemnity that runs the risk 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:33.120
 the head has 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:36.480
 Logic if you want, it 's good to take that part. 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:45.360
 here too loves them they take there 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:48.000
 So take this off and get it all and leave it. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.700
 always run at last riding you 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 all the exhaust back with the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.590
 put together the dm 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.120
 the distributor does not go to line the 26 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.180
 We are going to have a risk that the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.090
 another is not in focus but has another 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.630
 scratch the towel 2 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.060
 take it with care always only spare 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.620
 releasing the piece without much of it to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.130
 low or upwards only gives a swing 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.380
 money she gets out 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.980
 the point the point is like this 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.980
 See here the upe here 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.129
 here is the letter u here has a risk 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.470
 who have a risk 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.670
 here is another risk and here the other 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.590
 risk 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:43.080
 let's risk the bass he has to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:48.540
 knock here on the hood here and 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.989
 This risk is 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:04:01.470
 're seeing here behind the small arrow had 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:05.670
 beating him and even here the same thing 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.480
 right there beating him I then 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.269
 three points here hit the little set here 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:17.699
 here beating the seven years here and here 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.959
 knocking on the small set there 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.979
 It's going to be up to me to film what I'm going to have. 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.340
 that take the wheel but let me see if it gives 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.340
 for everything 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.740
 Do you see right here? 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.380
 here is a great little appellation and soon 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.730
 here are three more one next to each other 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:48.370
 You use this one here in this 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:52.180
 O risk here was beneath where the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:56.140
 Screw has a well down there 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.120
 he had not on my finger has a type 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.460
 a little you point this little piece 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.030
 This warm up is a bit off. 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.370
 but here there is no one perfect either 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.910
 You put on the retina well 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.620
 this bad here and ready will give in 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.950
 Only this point 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.830
 the accessory belt that does not move just 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.110
 will loosen the screw running will 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.640
 Loose and pull her out the first 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.950
 Duck cover could fit the finger 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.520
 here take off the lid and pull it out 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.410
 leaving here does not try to pull her out of a 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.570
 side may leave the right that you have 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.720
 slope that when a little luck of 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:39.280
 new you put first in point o of 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.760
 then I put down the point and 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.660
 then comes with the strap pulling it to 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.720
 We fit the tooth first here. 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.400
 already boxed full boxed says it goes 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.240
 pick up a tool will skip a 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.740
 Screw of casing pulley from below and twist 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.420
 motor sense always counterclockwise 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.970
 turned engine two strokes with engine 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:09.070
 Whole before tightening the screw yield 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.350
 two around here that will get Durinho 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.610
 It will get a little harder and here a 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.180
 little softer 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.040
 There you go there and bolt cable grip 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.460
 any question 8 ask me at 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.460
 hour there
