00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
slightly the blinking of the eyes is a
bit<00:01:16.650> more<00:01:16.770> prominent<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> video<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
bit more prominent in this video as it's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289
