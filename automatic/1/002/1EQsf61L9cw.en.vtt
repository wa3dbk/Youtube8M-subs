00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 Come on, people, come here today. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.460
 One more video there for you. 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.769
 This video will be very cool, it's an envelope. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 a question the user commented on was 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.660
 he had a weed he asked if the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.699
 tablet is 60 to draw with it 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 It's kind of strange, I found it 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 Strange at first I thought he was 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.510
 wanting to talk was to follow the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.970
 drawing on tablet not always coming down 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 role but I think he's talking about 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.399
 on screen designed by the same right 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.160
 It's in this case I find it quite interesting. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.989
 his question I'll be here one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 drawing application and the increase of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.969
 and we will now see how 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.379
 More or less it works to see if it is 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.520
 What do you guys hope is if the touch 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 responsive then let's see how 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.040
 it works ii 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.110
 the application 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.840
 [Music] 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.960
 the application I'm going to use is this one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.930
 sketchbook for tablet 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 I do not know if you speak like that, but you do not 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 you find it will increase the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.130
 stocks 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.410
 he was very well here quietly 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.440
 so come on I do not know how to draw 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.580
 So it's no use thinking 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.000
 It happens is a very cool thing. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.790
 10 boost was in some drawings and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.100
 simple but what are you going to give 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.590
 realize responds ciutat won the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.050
 application is running legal 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.420
 you will draw your own conclusions 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.580
 according to what you live in 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.500
 video do not go there 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.500

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.480
 [Music] 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.400
 So, guys, did you see more or more? 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.010
 the less the drawing is to get without much evil 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.680
 It's you who would help to use a pen. 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.220
 touch but I do not have here to be able to 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.370
 use but you can see how the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.000
 touch has reacted is the simultaneous ringtones 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.160
 huh 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.920
 we come here so it is not had 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.550
 no gagging with respect to the assailant 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.350
 was quite responsive now with 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.960
 respect to draw ne 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.990
 there and only who can draw or who 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.510
 have a pen and to test will power 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.510
 see if it really works for this 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.030
 or not because I do not have a pen and 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.370
 I do not even know if she was going to help 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.470
 so I mess up and I do not know either 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 to draw then this complicates then 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.820
 it was more for you to see the difference 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.360
 touch ness and it will work that way or 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.570
 not then if the doubts you expect 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.930
 if the tank was no doubt responsive 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.080
 no replying rate superbem is has 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.710
 some sakineh things are watching 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.690
 that solution will soon crack and he 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.960
 is really following without any 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.690
 without a gas is just one 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.550
 thing I realized is that sometimes the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.560
 people are trying for example me 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.220
 I was trying here on the side and you 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.870
 saw there I ended up pulling here and 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.870
 April here multitasking account neither opening 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.820
 so I had not pulled by check 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.890
 he unwittingly opened many tasks to 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.160
 Same thing on the other side, it's difficult for me 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.550
 I pulled in the tests I did before the x 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.900
 video and painting here on the side and 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.919
 Pulling in here and skirt is theme no more than 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.020
 The world will end because of this. 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.200
 on the contrary the app is very cool 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.110
 very functional is the tablet responds 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.000
 very good ram memory processor not 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.270
 disturbed 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.250
 on the contrary they believed very well 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.919
 it will only depend now on making your 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.840
 talent in this you can draw and 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.830
 Do you have a proper pen I think? 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.650
 that the pens 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.380
 I do not know about the drawing but I think 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.000
 that the thinner pens do not think the 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.950
 test it will not respond very well 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.710
 this was an average 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.680
 I think it works well. 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.350
 be well there their performances 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.810
