00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:16.320
 lÃ¼demann and ag today once the osram 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:18.470
 LED lighting in front of a lamp comes in so 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.029
 this package comes another one 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 understands the compatibility list on it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.640
 for the vehicles with a bit more 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 Operation that I'm in there then 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
 Twice this led combibad will run the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.010
 remaining then also the turn off 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.590
 include two pieces of it 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:47.340
 beautiful hi cast body heat derive 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.180
 luminous range control all a while 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.410
 daily rate blind cap for 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 Fog light for the plug of the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.000
 after that stays clear then 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 corresponding cable tie current 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.489
 parasites, however, really good of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.530
 3m we can still recommend 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.180
 there are lions accordingly when I 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.430
 that had the control unit on 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 accordingly large wire harness for 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.299
 connection here accordingly on 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.119
 the other end the two connection for 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.040
 the fog lights 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.229
 okay we have to the right and left of it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.180
 do not swap the rest you can 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.420
 right and left here on the cable set 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.689
 do not swap because once plug 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 and socket and again turned plug 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.710
 and socket so you can not go wrong 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.920
 do 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.259
 then we'll see let's take the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.229
 lamp when I turn it now 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:50.810
 this is the left and in the direction of travel 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.810
 there we have the right in the direction of travel 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:01.340
 how do we use one and the other? 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:13.730
 bumpers here the bumper of the dacia 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 duster admira look and of course 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.700
 screwdrivers fit the 1 to irritate 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.780
 you need the existing recordings 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.780
 do not worry about it 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:40.280
 bring in and screw in there already 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.460
 in another video I already have 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.690
 shown how to dismantle bumpers 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.000
 that is not the problem 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.800
 the vision from behind by looking up 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.620
 the alignment will pay attention to the lamp 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.110
 fits one-to-one into the recording here 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.020
 is then practically the plug of 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.390
 previous fog light comes here 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.420
 usually the wind stronger it 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.250
 so that it is sealed 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.239
 we do it differently with her here 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.380
 leave costume 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.690
 I simply remove this sentence 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.410
 out of the bumper because what not 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.730
 used is not pure for me 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.280
 means extra weight and so on 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.630
 on and on and we can do that 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:29.090
 existing recordings for the cable of 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:34.220
 the osram daytime running lights so if it is the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.880
 I have the rest of these y 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.790
 cable then practically here is the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.560
 capital city for the central plug 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.660
 of fog lights and that's the one 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.410
 from which the headlights on the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.410
 left side in the direction of travel 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.390
 so or do we want to look like that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.800
 cable length rauskomme look at 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.510
 you can unsubscribe course then 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.140
 accordingly, assuming that 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.810
 the cable lengths gentleman is long enough 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.790
 At least I hope to see where we are again 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.510
 leak 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.270
 then we bring the cable from the osram 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:22.360
 daytime running lights in there where before the 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:24.940
 original cable has sat on the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:39.250
 the other side that is clean and 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:41.400
 are neat and then we would have 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.229
 ever 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.160
 the first one was laid , so to speak 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.470
 is screwed on the side too 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.340
 Here, too, you can see that now 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:01.530
 yes, this is usually it 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.520
 better represent with this is the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.639
 access to the regular 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.650
 Headlamp leveling and sitting here 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.789
 the regulation on the side that is 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.340
 This would have to make a new hole 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.289
 Become the whole here with it 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.330
 be set properly on it 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:20.789
 pay attention not that it's all fixed who 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:31.410
 have on it and you then later on it 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:39.050
 so comes the second one , too 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:39.050
 eighth tighten 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.800
 then we have this page here too 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.040
 firmly screwed so both are coming 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.430
 as seen from outside into the bumper 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.430
 installed 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.760
 And the rest is then of course only 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.440
 control module connect everything together 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.370
 lead neatly up in the 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.570
 engine room and then that's done 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.030
 Show vehicle once only briefly how 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.560
 just it works 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.840
 and in this sense I hope as always 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.610
 that I could continue to help and say 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.610
 as always up to change
