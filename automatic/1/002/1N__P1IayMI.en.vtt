00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
nicely shaped and you can also take it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.280 
nicely shaped and you can also take it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
off and move it in two positions a bit

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.100 
off and move it in two positions a bit
closer<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.340> if<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.640> put<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.630> all<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.960> way
