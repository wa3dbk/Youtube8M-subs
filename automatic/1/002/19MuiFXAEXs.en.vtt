00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.520
 a greeting to all from paolo resemble the 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.509
 our space is basically dedicated 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.750
 always or almost always for beginners 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.490
 this time we will make an exception and no 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.009
 because beginners are sorry 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.250
 because why we think that sometimes too 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.220
 for them it is necessary when in 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.980
 when to increase one's enlargement 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.200
 own horizons and go and see what 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.329
 there is more to why not try to do 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.469
 something more complicated like the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.530
 soundgarden piece this time 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.140
 rather interesting called 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.839
 black holes hall you will find all the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.809
 details on the number of newsagents ad 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:07.860
 October la 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.189
 the quality of this piece is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.560
 extremely intriguing indented does 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.810
 great use of the bar 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.170
 you will see it often already you like little but 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.170
 however, warn you that in general that ibarra 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.330
 we will use are mostly on the strings anymore 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.159
 low so you can try to do 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 also this movement does not put 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.509
 necessarily all the index though 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.700
 it would be a good thing but try to 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.970
 use a sort of half sea on 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.280
 lower strings 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 the whole will be shelled by a series d 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.720
 arpeggios a bit unusual with a thick flavor 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.720
 curious 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.110
 but absolutely worth 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.079
 try 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.619
 another important thing to say is that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.640
 compared to a normal tuning this 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.820
 piece would you instead of a 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.349
 open tuning different from the usual 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:17.920
 rnaldo that rope that normally is 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:24.540
 call passed me must drop down to 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.540
 become similar to the fourth thing 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.860
 Yes No 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.920
 so yes we will have instead of mine 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.990
 pass a low king that's why he did 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.870
 reference to the fourth string that is 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.480
 precisely national reality 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.720
 this allows obtaining of the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.900
 very special sounds we are at the top 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.070
 sera grunge and how it often happens in 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.190
 these cases tuning of this type 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:07.060
 they are used a lot guarantee 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 position otherwise not feasible on 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.040
 guitar neck tuned in 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.470
 standard ways are situations that are 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.060
 this type of agreement is often used 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.520
 of this type of arpeggios is enough 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.440
 remember the first guide feeds an e 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.700
 or worse already faced by us in a 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.810
 other video denis callback go to it 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.080
 to see 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.540
 let's start this beautiful song 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.350
 slow ballad we do it in one 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.850
 acoustic version of chris cornell that 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.239
 often used to propose in concerts since 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.020
 I live alone with acoustic guitar e 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.570
 it consists of say a verse of a 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.980
 refrain and honored and instrumental 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.800
 curious enough we see the verse 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.900
 hard to understand when it starts but 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.450
 go and see what you've read 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.070
 on this month's article and try to 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.070
 do it this way 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.590
 an interesting structure is taken 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.750
 complicated view so it doesn't make much sense 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.090
 that you can't hear the voice you can 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.960
 ask me to sing because it is not the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.720
 case 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.510
 you have seen great display of barrett e 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.510
 great movement of the right hand 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.510
 I played used here playing 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.910
 an alternate picking 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.000
 you have also noticed the use of some 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.669
 agreements 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.669
 dearest details to the big circus 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:31.759
 and instead we come to a later part 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:34.639
 which is the one in which the voice of Cogne is 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.709
 it's definitely more aggressive more 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.199
 powerful all over a ride 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:44.080
 recurrent of three agreements that are 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.080
 exactly we said before 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.720
 here 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.860
 when he sings black hole sun black 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.860
 hole sun etcetera 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.459
 Well 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.850
 after ten an instrumental part 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.919
 very interesting in three quarters instead 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:25.040
 that in four years if you don't hear of 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.040
 matches the m has changed and between this 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:51.110
 notice this movement that we 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:56.350
 we call everything upbeat very insightful 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.350
 but above all this final agreement 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.490
 quite unusual in flavor 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.150
 titration is fine 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.110
 try it don't spare yourself it is difficult 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.750
 we know it 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:19.430
 a muscle should happen to me 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.440
 noticeable here by doing the bar not 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.650
 it is impossible to find top that does not have 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.490
 very fast speed I spoke 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.490
 of the entire structure 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.480
 by scanning note by note you can also 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.850
 try to use your fingertips 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.560
 fingers of the right hand in this case of 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.480
 do a little like when you do 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.210
 they face the wall units here from the classic 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.210
 using your thumb and then shelling 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.510
 the other fingers index average annular 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.610
 etc. etc. 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.520
 this is also an interesting approach 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:06.510
 could be useful thank you there 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.700
 we hear the next installment that will be 

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:13.260
 necessarily simpler than this 

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.260
 thanks hello from mini break
