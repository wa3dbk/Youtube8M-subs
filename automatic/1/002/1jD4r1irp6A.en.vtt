00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello to all on time today I 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.520
 you boast a marble art mail and effects 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.040
 marbled 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 so it's a mail art that goes pretty fast 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.090
 which makes a very nice effect and we do not have 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 need a lot of material for the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.310
 realize so I needed the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 3 in 1 varnish beats scott and opcodes of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 checchi that then the varnish 279 in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.050
 kiko also the polish pile hour of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.669
 at home and a doubt a hen so 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 or then you take a toothpick or a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.989
 needle it's going really well too 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 it's gone after digging 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.739
 scott bomb 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.579
 I put my big road of my varnish 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.579
 little everywhere on the nail 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.720
 like this is with no doubt include I 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:01.190
 just come mix the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:05.840
 colors here are not forgetting the edge 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.500
 of the nail the cuticles end in 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.500
 trying not to touch them 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.579
 so be careful because it dries very 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:19.530
 very quickly so do not hesitate to add 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.909
 the color where it's in the bank trying 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.649
 do not iron you have already mixed 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.359
 because that's very, very quickly 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.079
 so you risk making holes 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.079
 in your nail polish 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.850
 either we tried not to 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.560
 mix otherwise the colors will become 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.280
 a single color and we're not going 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.270
 see all the effect marc andrÃ© if we 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.100
 worried about passionate about 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.540
 cuticles to be cleaned after with a 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.540
 small cotton swab and solvent 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.770
 and here we are after we come 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.020
 at the edge of the nail for the overflow of 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.570
 varnish like this so in this June 8 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.210
 take one last toul and I come to do 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.420
 the demarcation of cuticles and 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.420
 varnish 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.320
 like these a cotton swab soaked in 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.230
 dissolving I just make the outlines 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.070
 of the nail for the varnish that has exceeded 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.660
 you can immediately a 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.250
 its as the dry polish in 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.150
 paying attention to basic at a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.459
 touched the tape varnish enough 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.079
 so once it's dry I 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.079
 have just applied my top coat 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.650
 always pro to protect the nail art 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:02.129
 and for a brighter effect without 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 forget about edging the nail and so here 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.090
 I hope it will be the art you liked and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.200
 I'll see you soon for a new 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.200
