00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
there but I just don't think hire has

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.230 
there but I just don't think hire has
much<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.070> way<00:00:02.129> forces<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.610> all<00:00:02.760> nuke<00:00:03.030> is

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
much in the way forces at all nuke is

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.660 
much in the way forces at all nuke is
gonna<00:00:03.540> come<00:00:03.780> off<00:00:03.990> pick<00:00:04.680> off<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:04.980> lot<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
gonna come off pick off a lot of the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.579 
gonna come off pick off a lot of the
forces<00:00:06.150> Nexus<00:00:06.660> go<00:00:06.810> down<00:00:07.020> alongside<00:00:07.350> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
forces Nexus go down alongside the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.830 
forces Nexus go down alongside the
cannons<00:00:08.220> but<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.880> still<00:00:09.150> think<00:00:09.450> Freeth<00:00:09.630> gonna

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
cannons but I still think Freeth gonna

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.030 
cannons but I still think Freeth gonna
be<00:00:09.900> able<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> accomplish<00:00:10.559> something<00:00:10.740> inside

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
be able to accomplish something inside

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.530 
be able to accomplish something inside

really<00:04:39.160> needs<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:39.580> additional<00:04:40.030> basis<00:04:40.389> who

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
really needs this additional basis who

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.270 
really needs this additional basis who
is<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.720> total<00:04:41.020> composition<00:04:41.319> was<00:04:41.650> bad<00:04:41.800> he<00:04:41.979> held

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
is the total composition was bad he held

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.089 
is the total composition was bad he held
it<00:04:42.430> off<00:04:42.580> for<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.509> long<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:44.169> valiantly<00:04:44.680> but<00:04:45.009> as

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
it off for so long so valiantly but as

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.469 
it off for so long so valiantly but as
soon<00:04:45.220> as<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.370> recall<00:04:45.789> came<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.180> there<00:04:46.330> was

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
soon as that recall came in there was

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.330 
soon as that recall came in there was
nothing<00:04:46.870> he<00:04:46.990> should<00:04:47.169> have<00:04:47.259> had<00:04:47.410> mines<00:04:47.800> there

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
nothing he should have had mines there

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.999 
nothing he should have had mines there
he<00:04:48.520> should<00:04:48.580> have<00:04:48.789> more<00:04:49.060> siege<00:04:49.479> tanks<00:04:50.020> vultures

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
he should have more siege tanks vultures

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.529 
he should have more siege tanks vultures
he<00:04:51.310> just<00:04:51.490> did<00:04:51.669> not<00:04:51.789> have<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.030> defense<00:04:52.449> he

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
he just did not have the defense he

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.900 
he just did not have the defense he
needs<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:53.470> he<00:04:53.500> did<00:04:54.009> not<00:04:54.160> just<00:04:54.400> he<00:04:54.580> wasn't

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
needs and he did not just he wasn't

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.320 
needs and he did not just he wasn't
building<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.300> regular<00:04:55.660> army<00:04:55.960> for<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.289> long<00:04:57.330> but

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
building a regular army for so long but

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.360 
building a regular army for so long but
this<00:04:58.449> has<00:04:58.599> been<00:04:58.720> actually<00:04:59.199> insane<00:04:59.680> pbt<00:05:00.190> who

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
this has been actually insane pbt who

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.129 
this has been actually insane pbt who
won<00:05:00.699> two<00:05:00.970> atps<00:05:01.389> actually<00:05:01.690> managed<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.870> get<00:05:02.020> off

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
won two atps actually managed to get off

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.710 
won two atps actually managed to get off
I<00:05:02.289> think<00:05:02.500> because<00:05:03.250> supply<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.789> back<00:05:04.449> science

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
I think because supply to back science

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.600 
I think because supply to back science
was<00:05:04.900> getting<00:05:05.110> got<00:05:05.650> picked<00:05:05.830> up<00:05:05.949> and<00:05:06.280> I'm<00:05:06.580> not

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
was getting got picked up and I'm not

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.710 
was getting got picked up and I'm not
quite<00:05:06.759> sure<00:05:06.819> whether<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.240> Archon<00:05:07.599> has

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
quite sure whether the Archon has

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.300 
quite sure whether the Archon has
actually<00:05:07.990> been<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.259> use<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.680> all<00:05:09.490> so<00:05:09.729> far<00:05:10.000> and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
actually been of use and all so far and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.350 
actually been of use and all so far and
