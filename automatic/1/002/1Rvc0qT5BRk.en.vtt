underarm<00:00:06.480> catches<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.460> tutorial

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
underarm catches and this is my tutorial

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.080 
underarm catches and this is my tutorial
for<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.420> IJA<00:00:09.840> youtube<00:00:10.650> tutorial<00:00:11.190> contest<00:00:11.730> for

for the IJA youtube tutorial contest for
2013<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:15.139> know<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.410> trick<00:00:16.740> doesn't<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
2013 I know the trick doesn't have a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.029 
2013 I know the trick doesn't have a
very<00:00:17.580> interesting<00:00:18.029> name<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.770> trick

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
very interesting name but the trick

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.580 
very interesting name but the trick
itself<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.789> actually<00:00:21.029> really<00:00:21.779> cool<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.199> it's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
itself is actually really cool and it's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.700 
itself is actually really cool and it's
a<00:00:22.619> lot<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.130> fun<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> pretty<00:00:25.260> easy<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a lot of fun to do it's pretty easy to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.580 
a lot of fun to do it's pretty easy to
learn<00:00:25.859> too<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.699> basically<00:00:27.119> composes<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> just

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
learn too it basically composes of just

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400 
learn too it basically composes of just
a<00:00:28.680> couple<00:00:28.890> parts<00:00:29.390> essentially<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
a couple parts essentially it's doing a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.280 
a couple parts essentially it's doing a
cross<00:00:31.740> arms<00:00:32.070> cascade<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.940> both<00:00:33.480> sides<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
cross arms cascade on both sides and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
cross arms cascade on both sides and
connecting<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:35.520> underarm

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
connecting it with these underarm

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.500 
connecting it with these underarm
catches

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.690 

so<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.290> first<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.980> should<00:00:47.160> learn<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
so the first thing you should learn is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.500 
so the first thing you should learn is
across<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.630> cascade<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.640> notice<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
across our cascade so if you notice a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
across our cascade so if you notice a
cross-armed<00:00:55.140> cascade<00:00:55.730> actually<00:00:56.730> looks

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
cross-armed cascade actually looks

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.740 
cross-armed cascade actually looks
identical<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.290> normal<00:00:59.100> cascade<00:00:59.750> except

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
identical to a normal cascade except

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.960 
identical to a normal cascade except
that<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.769> arms<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.250> crossed<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
that here my arms are crossed on the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.210 
that here my arms are crossed on the
left<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> normal

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
left and on the right is just a normal

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.390 
left and on the right is just a normal
cascade<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.440> you<00:01:07.440> may<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.890> learned<00:01:08.190> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
cascade so you may have learned a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
cascade so you may have learned a
cross-armed<00:01:09.030> cascade<00:01:09.509> before<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> might

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
cross-armed cascade before but it might

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
cross-armed cascade before but it might
have<00:01:10.619> looked<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> not

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
have looked like this and this is not

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
have looked like this and this is not
what<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.259> this<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> more<00:01:13.979> similar

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
what you want to do this is more similar

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.690 
what you want to do this is more similar
to<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.729> reverse<00:01:15.270> cascade<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.009> won't<00:01:17.340> help

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
to a reverse cascade and that won't help

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
to a reverse cascade and that won't help
you<00:01:17.880> learn<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.720> trick<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.630> breaking<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you learn this trick so when breaking it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
you learn this trick so when breaking it
down<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.800> one<00:01:22.920> ball<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
down to just one ball you see here it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380 
down to just one ball you see here it
does<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.140> same<00:01:25.560> figure-eight<00:01:26.340> pattern<00:01:26.390> that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
does that same figure-eight pattern that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.180 
does that same figure-eight pattern that
you<00:01:27.539> first<00:01:27.840> learned<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.530> learned<00:01:29.009> how

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
you first learned when you learned how

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.639 
you first learned when you learned how
to<00:01:29.220> juggle<00:01:29.520> three<00:01:29.970> balls<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> difference

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
to juggle three balls the difference

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.680 
to juggle three balls the difference
though<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.399> now<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.420> have

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
though is that now you don't really have

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.320 
though is that now you don't really have
enough<00:01:34.020> room<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> scoop<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.670> scoops<00:01:36.000> are

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
enough room to scoop and your scoops are

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.630 
enough room to scoop and your scoops are
really<00:01:36.869> awkward<00:01:37.440> because<00:01:37.710> they're<00:01:38.070> backwards

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
really awkward because they're backwards

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.820 
really awkward because they're backwards
and<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> whole<00:01:39.570> thing<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.050> just<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.649> weird

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
and the whole thing is just really weird

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.669 
and the whole thing is just really weird
so<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.030> takes<00:01:42.240> some<00:01:42.479> getting<00:01:42.509> used<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:48.679> with

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
so it takes some getting used to with

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.919 
so it takes some getting used to with
two<00:01:49.950> balls<00:01:50.220> you'll<00:01:50.910> end<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.209> doing<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.599> same

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
two balls you'll end up doing that same

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.440 
two balls you'll end up doing that same
X<00:01:52.380> pattern<00:01:52.979> when<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> first<00:01:53.970> learned<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
X pattern when you first learned how to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.960 
X pattern when you first learned how to
juggle<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.030> catch<00:01:57.450> catch<00:01:57.810> pattern

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
juggle or the one to catch catch pattern

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.520 
juggle or the one to catch catch pattern
be<00:01:59.970> careful<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.780> throwing<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
be careful that you're not throwing that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.979 
be careful that you're not throwing that
second<00:02:02.130> ball<00:02:02.280> around<00:02:02.849> the<00:02:03.090> first<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.660> you

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
second ball around the first one you

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:16.280 
second ball around the first one you
want<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> throw<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.679> underneath

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.110 

it'll<00:02:17.290> feel<00:02:17.530> much<00:02:17.800> more<00:02:18.010> normal<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.700> do<00:02:19.000> an

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
it'll feel much more normal to do an

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.300 
it'll feel much more normal to do an
outside<00:02:19.569> throw<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.709> that's<00:02:20.830> when<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.160> have

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
outside throw but that's when you have

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.369 
outside throw but that's when you have
to<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.790> backwards<00:02:22.269> scoop<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.260> was

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
to do that backwards scoop I was

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:31.870 
to do that backwards scoop I was
mentioning<00:02:23.920> before

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.170 

so<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:32.690> three<00:02:32.990> balls<00:02:33.520> it'll<00:02:34.520> look<00:02:34.700> like<00:02:34.910> this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so with three balls it'll look like this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.320 
so with three balls it'll look like this
and<00:02:35.800> make<00:02:36.800> sure<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.460> did<00:02:37.700> practice<00:02:38.180> this

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and make sure that you did practice this

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.510 
and make sure that you did practice this
on<00:02:38.540> both<00:02:38.600> sides<00:02:39.260> because<00:02:39.650> you'll<00:02:40.040> need<00:02:40.220> to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
on both sides because you'll need to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.670 
on both sides because you'll need to
know<00:02:40.730> both<00:02:41.030> sides<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.540> order<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.960> do<00:02:42.140> underarm

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
know both sides in order to do underarm

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.450 
know both sides in order to do underarm
catches<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.470> when<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.740> comes<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.160> doing<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
catches so when it comes to doing the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.490 
catches so when it comes to doing the
actual<00:02:46.610> trick<00:02:47.120> notice<00:02:47.600> how<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.020> do<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.200> cross

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
actual trick notice how I do a cross

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.370 
actual trick notice how I do a cross
arms<00:02:48.800> cascade<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.610> then<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.330> flip<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.110> top

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
arms cascade and then I flip the top

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.500 
arms cascade and then I flip the top
hand<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> bottom<00:02:54.760> after<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.790> flip<00:02:56.090> my<00:02:56.120> hand

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
hand to the bottom after I flip my hand

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.630 
hand to the bottom after I flip my hand
I<00:02:56.810> go<00:02:57.050> back<00:02:57.320> into<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.800> cross<00:02:58.430> armed<00:02:58.850> cascade<00:03:03.640> so

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
I go back into a cross armed cascade so

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.520 
I go back into a cross armed cascade so
here<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.090> slowed<00:03:05.390> down<00:03:05.420> noticed<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.320> hand

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
here it is slowed down noticed the hand

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.440 
here it is slowed down noticed the hand
on<00:03:06.680> top<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:07.490> with<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.760> green<00:03:08.030> bracelet

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
on top the one with the green bracelet

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.740 
on top the one with the green bracelet
it<00:03:08.840> flips<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.680> bottom<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.270> goes

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
it flips to the bottom and then it goes

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.430 
it flips to the bottom and then it goes
back<00:03:12.020> into<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.380> cross<00:03:12.680> iron<00:03:12.920> cascade<00:03:14.440> what's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
back into a cross iron cascade what's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.140 
back into a cross iron cascade what's
nice<00:03:15.650> about<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:16.100> trick<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.460> that<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.760> can

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
nice about this trick is that you can

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.780 
nice about this trick is that you can
break<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.570> down<00:03:17.600> into<00:03:18.110> just<00:03:18.710> one<00:03:19.190> catch<00:03:19.520> at<00:03:19.760> a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
break it down into just one catch at a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.030 
break it down into just one catch at a
time<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.450> then<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:21.080> can<00:03:21.230> start<00:03:21.470> building<00:03:21.680> on

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
time and then you can start building on

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.970 
time and then you can start building on
two<00:03:22.520> catches<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.270> three<00:03:23.540> catches<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.590> actual

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
two catches and three catches the actual

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.220 
two catches and three catches the actual
trick<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.490> just<00:03:25.910> every<00:03:26.420> catch<00:03:26.660> being<00:03:26.960> caught

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
trick is just every catch being caught

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.680 
trick is just every catch being caught
underneath

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.170 

so<00:03:33.410> here's<00:03:33.680> another<00:03:33.740> one<00:03:34.250> ball<00:03:34.490> exercise<00:03:35.000> you

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
so here's another one ball exercise you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.840 
so here's another one ball exercise you
can<00:03:35.300> try<00:03:35.500> where<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.590> hand<00:03:36.830> on<00:03:37.010> top<00:03:37.280> throws

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
can try where the hand on top throws

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.510 
can try where the hand on top throws
flips<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.410> other<00:03:39.590> hand<00:03:40.010> catches<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
flips and the other hand catches the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.580 
flips and the other hand catches the
ball<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.910> same<00:03:47.240> technique<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.990> applied<00:03:48.320> to

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
ball the same technique is applied to

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.100 
ball the same technique is applied to
every<00:03:48.620> single<00:03:49.190> throw<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:49.820> catch<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.540> that's

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
every single throw and catch and that's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.420 
every single throw and catch and that's
when<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.350> have<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.710> full<00:03:51.920> trick<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.400> doing

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
when you have the full trick of doing

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.840 
when you have the full trick of doing
underarm<00:03:53.030> catches<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:55.070> here's<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.430> trick<00:03:55.640> one

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
underarm catches so here's the trick one

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:05.229 
underarm catches so here's the trick one
more<00:03:56.060> time

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.330 

my<00:04:06.239> last<00:04:06.450> piece<00:04:06.719> of<00:04:06.780> advice<00:04:06.989> would<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.799> be<00:04:08.010> a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
my last piece of advice would just be a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.449 
my last piece of advice would just be a
transition<00:04:09.209> into<00:04:09.719> this<00:04:09.840> trick<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:11.189> have

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
transition into this trick and I have

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.520 
transition into this trick and I have
found<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> easiest<00:04:12.510> way<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.810> go<00:04:13.230> into

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
found that the easiest way to go into

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.259 
found that the easiest way to go into
this<00:04:13.650> trick<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.129> throwing<00:04:14.400> three<00:04:14.670> straight<00:04:15.150> up

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
this trick is throwing three straight up

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.229 
this trick is throwing three straight up
throws<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:16.139> like<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.850> other<00:04:20.970> way<00:04:21.180> you

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
throws just like that the other way you

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.689 
throws just like that the other way you
can<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.350> with<00:04:22.830> siteswaps<00:04:23.430> you

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
can think of it is with siteswaps you

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.939 
can think of it is with siteswaps you
can<00:04:23.880> throw<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.210> four<00:04:24.840> four<00:04:25.169> four<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:27.830> then<00:04:28.830> you

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
can throw a four four four and then you

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.430 
can throw a four four four and then you
reach<00:04:29.190> underneath<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.970> catch<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.110> go<00:04:31.259> into

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
reach underneath and catch and go into

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.379 
reach underneath and catch and go into
the<00:04:31.620> trick<00:04:31.860> at<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.820> point<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.270> know
