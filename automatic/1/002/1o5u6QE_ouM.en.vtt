right<00:01:45.659> here's<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.649> motherboard<00:01:47.100> i<00:01:47.310> thought

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
right here's the motherboard i thought

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.429 
right here's the motherboard i thought
it'd<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.600> cool<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.110> every<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it'd be really cool to go every one of

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
it'd be really cool to go every one of
these<00:01:49.530> bolts<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.310> heatsink<00:01:50.939> across<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
these bolts with a heatsink across the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.539 
these bolts with a heatsink across the
board<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> metal<00:01:52.920> bar<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.399> wear

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
board here it's a metal bar gonna wear

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.209 
board here it's a metal bar gonna wear
across<00:01:53.899> just<00:01:54.899> looks<00:01:55.110> good<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> boards

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
across just looks good I know the boards

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.410 
across just looks good I know the boards
can<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.369> inside<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.759> casing<00:01:56.969> you're<00:01:57.299> not

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
can be inside the casing you're not

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.410 
can be inside the casing you're not
going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.869> though<00:01:59.030> it<00:02:00.030> still<00:02:00.240> looks

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
going to see it though it still looks

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.080 
going to see it though it still looks
good<00:02:00.600> though<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.729> looking<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
good though right so looking at the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.389 
good though right so looking at the
connectivity<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> back<00:02:04.350> ports<00:02:04.799> we've<00:02:05.159> got

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
connectivity on the back ports we've got
