you go on these websites not all gy6 are
the<00:00:34.079> same<00:00:34.550> MRP<00:00:35.550> uses<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> OEM<00:00:36.450> part<00:00:37.140> numbers

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the same MRP uses the OEM part numbers

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.170 
the same MRP uses the OEM part numbers
from<00:00:37.980> five<00:00:38.219> different<00:00:38.430> factories<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.149> China

from five different factories in China

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.330 
from five different factories in China
so<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> gy6<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> long<00:00:41.129> case

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so we have the gy6 for the long case

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
so we have the gy6 for the long case
short<00:00:41.640> case<00:00:41.989> Zhongshan<00:00:42.989> Yamada<00:00:43.980> Yamada<00:00:44.100> uses

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
have to look at this the belt pattern

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.480 
have to look at this the belt pattern
and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> measuring<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.049> moto<00:01:10.320> has<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> 150

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and the measuring see if moto has a 150

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
and the measuring see if moto has a 150
not<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> same<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> liquid-cooled<00:01:13.490> now

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
not the same it's a liquid-cooled now

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399 
not the same it's a liquid-cooled now
there's<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.360> different<00:01:16.320> types

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
there's also going to be different types

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.070 
there's also going to be different types
like<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> air<00:01:17.250> cooled<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.080> liquid

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
like the air cooled and the liquid

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.210 
like the air cooled and the liquid
cooled<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.409> also<00:01:19.560> different<00:01:19.920> types<00:01:20.100> of
