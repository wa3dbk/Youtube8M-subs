00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.790
 very good to all the kids today 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.160
 I will bring a different video I will 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.960
 bring a special video and it's a video of 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.670
 gratitude 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.930
 first I will tell you that what is 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.680
 living in depth what you are seeing from 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.840
 background is thus a bÃ©tera gameplay that 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.250
 I was with my girlfriend and it's been quite 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.100
 weather 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.920
 and good a video that went wrong 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.490
 audio that are our voices and then 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.990
 it can be and leave it for another 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.090
 At the moment, she is not someone you see there 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.130
 of blue with rabbit ears and 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.430
 I think this is the best opportunity to 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.520
 use what it is to thank you for 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.930
 I have reached 100 subscribers I do not know what 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.129
 there are not many of you many of you 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.650
 you create the pp that you have hundreds and thousands 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.500
 and hundreds of thousands too but good 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.090
 for me it's a record it 's something that never 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.130
 has got on my channel that has already 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.500
 enough time but recently 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.540
 I started commenting on the videos and also 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.309
 it's a something that fills me because I 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.340
 I do know that 100 people 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.210
 they support me that of my videos that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.550
 they comment from time to time and that they 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.440
 I like what I sell and if you do not like it 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.610
 they let me know why so what 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.890
 better is that is what matters most to me 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.360
 Really 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.030
 and I do not know much more to say simply 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.080
 thank you all for that for the support 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.369
 thank you for your comments 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 I like you as I said before 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.260
 and thanks especially to two hundred 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.860
 people in particular the first of them 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.630
 would be romelu geles because when he gave me 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.140
 so the slump of on the video the minimum 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.150
 enough to do it again and the other 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 kind of people would be mosquito since 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.009
 many of you will know because they are 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.590
 youtube already quite famous but it was your 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.659
 channel 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.900
 in a way it was his channel that made me 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.360
 start 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.630
 to comment on the videos, I did not see your channel 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.850
 I liked it a lot and they were super 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.340
 natural that were like I do not know how to have 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.260
 a colleague next to you while you play and the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.630
 truth is that I find it quite curious 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.520
 and I decided that I also wanted to have 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 something similar although it is not even far 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.060
 so good commenting on the videos but 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.470
 good and also because many times 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.110
 when I have I like a lot of 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.450
 you will surely have arrived 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.710
 thanks to me I like him because he is 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.190
 question of him putting me a like 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.130
 and at least 56 subscribers in less 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.360
 two minutes and nothing simply that of 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.150
 to thank everyone especially 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.760
 to them and tell you that I will keep going up 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.709
 videos that I will try to make every time 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360
 better my computer unfortunately does not give 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.700
 to make great assemblies why not 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.540
 they are usually quite simple 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.010
 and nothing that thanks for the support that the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.840
 that you continue supporting me and that every time 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.290
 let's be more because if I can continue 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.760
 improving the channel and a little more than 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.150
 simply that I leave you with the one 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.580
 employs that killing him with nothing and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.069
 nothing we'll see in the next video 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.220
 thank you very much for everything and even the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.220
 next
