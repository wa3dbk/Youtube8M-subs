00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 Generally this repair could be 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 classify them with riddles 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.860
 the engine of Avensis began to shake 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.450
 Yes, and zhor oil increased but by chance 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.640
 so much is not typical for toyotovskih 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 Motors that immediately go to otgadki 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.490
 and the whole thing turned out to be an exhaust valve 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.189
 so he burned out at all such trouble 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 found on motors but for this 1 z 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.680
 z f.e. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 volume one point eight liters 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.390
 such failure is not typical however as 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.399
 and for other modern toyotovskih 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 engines so the valve of course 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.030
 changed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.790
 but that's the reason for his burnout of course 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 possible and factory defect but abundance 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 resinous sediments and increased 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.910
 oil appetite motor suggests that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.710
 the reason is most likely in the oil scraper 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.750
 caps 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 compare the new one and which stood on the motor 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.949
 Firstly, the native simply made a fool 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.230
 second hole diameter is clearly 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.410
 exceeds the norm in general with their 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.940
 duties no longer cope 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 formed oil sludge was broken 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 temperature and valve as a result 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.049
 began to burn out at all on the factory 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.150
 the regulations prescribed every 80 thousand 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.010
 mileage frames check the clearance in the drive 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 valves 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.080
 however, as a rule no one does 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.909
 motivation just the reliable motor 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.159
 more adjustment process is complicated and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.170
 associated with the selection of the thickness of the pushers in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.090
 if necessary and disassembly 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 engine to be no small but how 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 shows this case sometimes all the same 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 useful where are the prescribed 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.960
 manufacturer 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.790
 work although we will once again emphasize this 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.740
 rare case 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 look at the car shop we are absolutely not 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 surprised that such parts are 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.549
 as the exhaust valve stem Valve 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 caps and pushers on avensis only 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.259
 custom parts are not claimed 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.729
 that only suggests that on 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.100
 adjustment of clearances in the valve 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.110
 the mechanism of owning is usually not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.640
 draws attention well how 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.890
 shows practice maybe she and not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.479
 it is necessary but sometimes there are 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.119
 unpleasant exceptions 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.369
 especially when mileage comes to 150 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.369
 thousand kilometers like this pudozh
