00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 are presented in Japan the xperia z4 with 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.960
 an unusual discretion is day 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.630
 presented in Japan his new vessel 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.630
 badge the xperia z4 that will arrive 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.660
 do not 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.880
 that will arrive in said country in summer and without 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.190
 that there is news about availability 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.260
 in other markets nor price for 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.110
 the terminal that is basically a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.450
 Ceta 3 update externally 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.700
 It is difficult to find differences between 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.830
 the new z4 and its predecessor and it 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.020
 fundamentally distinguishes by the new 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.940
 polished finish of the metal chassis and 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.309
 by the arrangement of the flash under the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.190
 camera lens the phone is 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.980
 something thinner with 6.9 millimeters of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.440
 Thick and somewhat lighter with 144 grams 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.629
 but the screen size remains 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.600
 with 5.2 inches and with it 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.570
 resolution full hd on the other hand as the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.240
 z3 the z4 is resistant to water and 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.850
 dust in the cameras there are some 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.590
 differences and the xperia z4 though 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.890
 incorporates a sensor with the same 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.810
 20 7 megapixel resolution includes 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
 focus by face detection that is 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 hopes to offer greater speed both 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.549
 in photography as in video the camera 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.830
 front is 51 megapixels and brings as 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.689
 novelty an optical stabilizer something that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.070
 we had not seen so far in a 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.780
 frontal camera 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.850
 Another of the strengths is the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.640
 video recording with the rear camera 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.220
 that reaches 4k resolution although it's something 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.520
 that already has the z3 and can record full 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.280
 hd at 60 frames per second in the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.690
 inside the xperia z4 equates how it works 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.170
 I was waiting for the qualcomm processor 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.229
 snapdragon 810 64-bit and 8-core 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.190
 with 3 gigabytes of ram graphic system 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.110
 adreno 430 32 gigabytes of 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.289
 expandable storage with a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.009
 micro SD card up to 128 gigabytes 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.860
 the battery will be 2,930 milliamps and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.350
 will be supplied with android 50 lollipop 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.380
 series will be available in four 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.720
 shades white black and light blue water and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.340
 as we said at the moment are unknown 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.150
 the price and the exact date of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.150
 availability
