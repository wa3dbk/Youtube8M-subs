00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:30.760
 coins 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.150

 I have lived in it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.170

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.550
 these conditions state data series as simple notes 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.590

 is part of the objects that have a sentimental value for Don Alfonso 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.599
 would be to have some own pressures 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.349
 for now it is not clear 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.079
 there was not much time 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.229
 for the area 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.899
