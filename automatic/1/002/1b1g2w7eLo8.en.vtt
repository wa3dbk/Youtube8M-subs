working with the children hands on so I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.560 
working with the children hands on so I
didn't<00:02:10.160> feel<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.580> bachelor's<00:02:11.060> degree<00:02:11.360> was

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
didn't feel like a bachelor's degree was

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.810 
didn't feel like a bachelor's degree was
that<00:02:11.780> important<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:13.310> all<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.790> sudden

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
that important and then all of a sudden

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.600 
that important and then all of a sudden
like<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.600> know<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:15.080> kept<00:02:16.040> believing<00:02:16.310> in

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
like you know I just kept believing in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.660 
like you know I just kept believing in
myself<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:18.260> know<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.640> hard

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
myself I know like you know it's so hard

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.330 
myself I know like you know it's so hard
to<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.510> confidence<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.130> motivated

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
to have confidence and to be motivated

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880 
to have confidence and to be motivated
but<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.300> think<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.020> it's<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.320> important

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
but I think that it's so important

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.220 
but I think that it's so important
because<00:02:25.010> once<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.550> do<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:26.330> lot<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.110> things

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
because once you do that a lot of things

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.600 
because once you do that a lot of things
can<00:02:27.530> change<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.950> your<00:02:28.070> life<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.520> you're

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
can change in your life and you're

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.310 
can change in your life and you're
actually<00:02:28.760> living<00:02:29.209> your<00:02:29.450> life<00:02:29.630> for<00:02:29.870> yourself

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
actually living your life for yourself

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.070 
actually living your life for yourself
so<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.340> hope<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> question<00:02:32.540> if<00:02:33.050> you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
so I hope that is a question if you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.259 
so I hope that is a question if you
could<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.650> any<00:02:33.980> superpower<00:02:34.489> what<00:02:34.820> would<00:02:35.090> it

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269

be<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.630> how<00:02:36.019> would<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.380> use<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:37.269> think<00:02:38.269> if<00:02:38.510> I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
be and how would you use it I think if I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.600 
be and how would you use it I think if I
could<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:39.019> any<00:02:39.260> superpower<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:40.340> now
