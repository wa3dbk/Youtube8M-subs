is disable your ignition I mean you
could<00:00:19.689> do<00:00:19.779> your<00:00:19.900> starter<00:00:20.349> or<00:00:20.680> fuel<00:00:21.160> injectors

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
could do your starter or fuel injectors

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.189 
could do your starter or fuel injectors
whatever<00:00:21.849> these<00:00:22.539> just<00:00:22.779> ways<00:00:22.929> to<00:00:23.080> do<00:00:23.170> it

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
whatever these just ways to do it

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.560 
whatever these just ways to do it
ignition<00:00:23.849> through<00:00:24.849> your<00:00:24.939> steering<00:00:25.179> column

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
ignition through your steering column

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.099 
ignition through your steering column
and<00:00:25.750> what<00:00:26.740> you<00:00:26.830> do<00:00:26.980> is<00:00:27.189> you<00:00:27.490> arm<00:00:27.820> you<00:00:28.750> wire<00:00:28.929> up<00:00:28.960> a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
and what you do is you arm you wire up a

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.249 
and what you do is you arm you wire up a
switch<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.740> you<00:00:30.310> split<00:00:30.580> up<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.230> your

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
switch and you split up one of your

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.700 
switch and you split up one of your
ignition<00:00:32.680> wires<00:00:34.020> causing<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.559> have

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
ignition wires causing you to have

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.330 
ignition wires causing you to have
control<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.430> when<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:37.090> want<00:00:37.300> them<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.540> be<00:00:38.340> live

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
control of when you want them to be live

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.510 
control of when you want them to be live
in<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.969> life<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:41.410> way<00:00:41.590> when<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.370> leave

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
in that life that way when you leave

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.790 
in that life that way when you leave
your<00:00:42.640> car<00:00:42.850> you<00:00:43.059> could<00:00:43.270> leave<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.570> off<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:44.110> mean

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
your car you could leave it off I mean

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.400 
your car you could leave it off I mean
you<00:00:44.890> can<00:00:45.010> make<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.219> live<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:46.199> there<00:00:47.199> won't<00:00:47.289> be

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
you can make it live so there won't be

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.540 
you can make it live so there won't be
no<00:00:47.530> power<00:00:47.680> running<00:00:48.070> through<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.370> it'll<00:00:48.460> be

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
no power running through and it'll be

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.090 
no power running through and it'll be
kind<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.879> shutting<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.449> off<00:00:49.539> in<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.750> way<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.980> you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
kind of shutting it off in a way so you

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.310 
kind of shutting it off in a way so you
have<00:00:51.309> no<00:00:51.430> start<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.960> I'll<00:00:53.079> show<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.230> that

some panels down here you drop your
steering<00:01:15.310> column<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.640> bit<00:01:15.790> there's<00:01:15.970> two<00:01:16.120> big

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
steering column a bit there's two big

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.690 
steering column a bit there's two big
bolts<00:01:16.510> right<00:01:16.660> there<00:01:16.870> and<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.770> find<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.100> pink<00:01:18.370> or

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.140 
bolts right there and you find a pink or
purple<00:01:19.150> wire<00:01:19.510> for<00:01:20.230> older<00:01:20.560> models<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:20.980> 88<00:01:21.400> and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
purple wire for older models like 88 and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.260 
purple wire for older models like 88 and
older<00:01:23.050> in<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.770> GM<00:01:24.010> cars<00:01:24.220> they'll<00:01:24.850> probably<00:01:25.060> be

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
older in the GM cars they'll probably be

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.900 
older in the GM cars they'll probably be
a<00:01:25.300> purple<00:01:25.690> wire<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.080> know<00:01:27.070> for<00:01:27.580> these<00:01:27.700> newer

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
a purple wire I know for these newer

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.240 
a purple wire I know for these newer
ones<00:01:28.180> it's<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.420> pink<00:01:28.630> one<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.770> wires<00:01:29.980> right

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
ones it's a pink one and the wires right

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.400 
ones it's a pink one and the wires right
on<00:01:30.430> top<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.700> your<00:01:31.060> steering<00:01:31.810> column<00:01:32.140> right<00:01:32.290> up

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
on top of your steering column right up

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.050 
on top of your steering column right up
there<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:33.220> can<00:01:33.370> find<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.700> underneath

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
there you can find it underneath

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.870 
there you can find it underneath
now<00:01:34.720> as<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.140> goes<00:01:35.380> around<00:01:35.800> you<00:01:36.700> know<00:01:36.820> you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
now as it goes around you know you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
now as it goes around you know you
splice<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:38.140> put<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.880> if<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.240> freely

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
splice that you put in know if I freely

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.950 
splice that you put in know if I freely
same<00:01:41.710> size<00:01:42.010> wires<00:01:42.400> doesn't<00:01:42.820> overheat<00:01:43.000> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
same size wires doesn't overheat and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.750 
same size wires doesn't overheat and
then<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.200> run<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.410> switch<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.250> then<00:01:45.640> you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
then you run a switch to it and then you

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.580 
then you run a switch to it and then you
run<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.090> somewhere<00:01:46.570> around<00:01:46.870> your<00:01:47.140> car<00:01:47.350> it

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
run it somewhere around your car it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.640 
run it somewhere around your car it
could<00:01:47.680> be<00:01:47.800> anywhere<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:50.170> way<00:01:50.320> when<00:01:50.590> you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
could be anywhere in that way when you

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.750 
could be anywhere in that way when you
think<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.890> car<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.190> could<00:01:51.280> pull<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.580> switch

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
think the car you could pull the switch

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.310 
think the car you could pull the switch
or<00:01:52.060> hit<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> switch<00:01:52.600> whatever<00:01:52.930> tell<00:01:53.140> us<00:01:53.230> what

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
or hit the switch whatever tell us what
