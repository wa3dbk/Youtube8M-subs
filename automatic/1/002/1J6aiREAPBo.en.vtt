now<00:00:24.610> the<00:00:24.670> composite<00:00:25.240> product<00:00:25.480> is<00:00:25.750> lightweight

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
now the composite product is lightweight

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.350 
now the composite product is lightweight
in<00:00:26.470> nature<00:00:26.860> so<00:00:27.189> it's<00:00:27.369> easy<00:00:27.580> to<00:00:27.789> handle<00:00:27.970> around

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
in nature so it's easy to handle around

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.450 
in nature so it's easy to handle around
the<00:00:28.480> job<00:00:28.689> site<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:29.650> can<00:00:29.830> see<00:00:29.980> we've<00:00:30.160> added

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
the job site you can see we've added

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.000 
the job site you can see we've added
hand<00:00:30.849> bolts<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:31.270> make<00:00:31.449> that<00:00:31.630> even<00:00:31.750> easier<00:00:32.010> now

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
hand bolts to make that even easier now

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.410 
hand bolts to make that even easier now
so<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.400> consumer<00:00:33.879> knows<00:00:34.059> what<00:00:34.270> they're

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
so the consumer knows what they're

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.229 
so the consumer knows what they're
buying<00:00:34.660> each<00:00:35.410> individual<00:00:36.100> box<00:00:36.400> is<00:00:36.730> labeled

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
buying each individual box is labeled

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.110 
buying each individual box is labeled
with<00:00:37.450> what's<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.500> box<00:00:38.710> so<00:00:39.370> this<00:00:39.640> have<00:00:39.820> no

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120

features and benefits of a square

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.620 
features and benefits of a square
product<00:01:19.979> p-square<00:01:20.979> composite<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.970> actually

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
product p-square composite is actually

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.359 
product p-square composite is actually
an<00:01:22.720> engineered<00:01:23.200> process<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:24.100> you<00:01:24.160> have

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
an engineered process so you have

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.150 
an engineered process so you have
consistency<00:01:25.210> on<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:26.170> bottoms<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.679> each<00:01:26.860> unit

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
consistency on the bottoms of each unit

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.100 
consistency on the bottoms of each unit
you'll<00:01:27.520> notice<00:01:27.820> an<00:01:27.970> engineer<00:01:28.450> ribbing

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
you'll notice an engineer ribbing

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.530 
you'll notice an engineer ribbing
construction<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.580> this<00:01:30.790> gives<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.119> a<00:01:31.150> self

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
construction so this gives you a self

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.719 
construction so this gives you a self
level<00:01:31.990> base<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.650> mortar<00:01:32.979> mix<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.340> no<00:01:33.490> longer

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729

that set these carefully aside take a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.660 
that set these carefully aside take a
few<00:02:40.830> measures

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.250 

you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.970 

we're<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.440> make<00:02:53.530> sure<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.920> our

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
subfloor is plumb and level so we're

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.600 
subfloor is plumb and level so we're
going<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.350> quick<00:02:56.620> check

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.520 

okay<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.270> reason<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.900> an<00:03:05.050> important

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
