00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.980
 so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 charlotte and gwendolyn are in 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.399
 the school at gwendolyn had always been 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.369
 said that when this moment happened 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.940
 and he would have to support his cousin and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.290
 draw a circle 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.020
 she will disappear when they reach the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.380
 home they start talking to the vigilantes 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.250
 which they are in charge of this is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.260
 could you say this organization knows 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.540
 takes to catch those of this group and 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 gwendolyn stays at home with her aunt 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.730
 grandmother and then when I always 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.530
 they had hidden much of this 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.350
 information and presume also let's say 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.180
 which is very curious then it starts to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.090
 ask her her grandmother and her great aunt 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.850
 it gives some answers is this 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.550
 of the gene of how it is to travel in time 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 because they take their cousin things from 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.420
 this guy when his great aunt asked him 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.050
 to gwendolyn to go for some candies 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.900
 of lemon she can without more leaves and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.880
 suddenly begins to feel vertigo is that 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.800
 feeling in the stomach as if 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.260
 you were on a roller coaster and basic 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.930
 and it 's free and suddenly everything changes 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.780
 for windows link the houses the cars 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.179

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.610
 of flowers and wonders what happened 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.550
 when suddenly you realize 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 in time they have been wrong all 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.170
 this time with charlotte as she is 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.610
 the one with this gene she is very 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.530
 worried because she had heard 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 that charlotte had received all kinds 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.370
 of training and some tips for 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.760
 when I came to this occasion to travel 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.140
 to the past and it is very worried 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.660
 because he does not know how long he will be 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.990
 there and this is where our 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.810
 story where when laser lines in the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.450
 time will face some adventures that 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 they are a little funny and also going to 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.850
 to be able to find his true love 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.739
 when lin has a friend called 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.720
 lenzly I think without this friend then 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.710
 good girlfriend could be much of the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.100
 things that he did because he is very supportive 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.680
 this leslie who is a friend starts to 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.720
 investigate for her you know in the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.390

 good friend gives you all the information 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.600
