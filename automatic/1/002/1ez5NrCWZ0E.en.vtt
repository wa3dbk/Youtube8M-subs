00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
passkey cactus which is like the letters

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.400 
passkey cactus which is like the letters
and<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:49.980> symbols<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> actually

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
like a modded version with gradual

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.350 
like a modded version with gradual
graphical<00:00:55.050> tilesets<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.239> these

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
graphical tilesets so if you think these

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.670 
graphical tilesets so if you think these
graphics<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.899> bad<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
graphics are bad you want to see the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.700 
graphics are bad you want to see the
original<00:00:58.890> game<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.079> game's<00:01:01.260> got<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> lot

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
original game and the game's got a lot

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189 
original game and the game's got a lot
of<00:01:01.739> history<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.609> floods<00:01:03.149> volcanoes<00:01:04.019> are

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of history like floods volcanoes are

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.130 
of history like floods volcanoes are
open<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.400> settlements<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.810> like

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
open like settlements and that like

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.929 
open like settlements and that like
there<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.040> saw<00:01:08.189> a-rod<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.700> built

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
there I think we saw a-rod get built

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670 
there I think we saw a-rod get built
while<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:09.869> cursor<00:01:10.049> honestly<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
while you can see my cursor honestly I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.240 
while you can see my cursor honestly I
think<00:01:10.830> possibly<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:13.260> anyway<00:01:13.680> yeah<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
think possibly but anyway yeah if you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.320 
think possibly but anyway yeah if you
don't<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.640> different<00:01:15.150> stuff

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
don't look like different stuff

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.130 
don't look like different stuff
happening<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:16.650> over<00:01:17.000> 200<00:01:18.000> yeah<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:18.659> 200

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
happening right over 200 yeah over 200

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.999 
happening right over 200 yeah over 200
three<00:01:19.350> years<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.710> history<00:01:21.710> anyway<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> game's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
three years of history anyway the game's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.140 
three years of history anyway the game's
about<00:01:23.220> seven<00:01:23.580> dwarfs<00:01:24.060> basically<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:26.150> yeah

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
about seven dwarfs basically and yeah

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.429 
about seven dwarfs basically and yeah
it's<00:01:27.240> basically<00:01:27.630> trying<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> make<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> fault

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it's basically trying to make a fault

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.920 
it's basically trying to make a fault
and<00:01:28.500> survive<00:01:29.090> like<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> physics<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and survive like the physics in this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.890 
and survive like the physics in this
game<00:01:31.229> are<00:01:31.259> absolutely<00:01:31.950> incredible<00:01:32.720> I'm<00:01:33.720> going

game are absolutely incredible I'm going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
game are absolutely incredible I'm going
to<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.079> over<00:01:34.110> various<00:01:34.650> stuff<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.340> going

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to go over various stuff this is going

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.770 
to go over various stuff this is going
to<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> let's<00:01:36.000> play<00:01:36.240> rather<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to be a let's play rather than a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.770 
to be a let's play rather than a
walkthrough<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.490> you're<00:01:38.729> expecting<00:01:39.150> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
walkthrough so if you're expecting in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
walkthrough so if you're expecting in
this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.500> basic<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> land<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.880> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
this is basic with the land so like this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
this is basic with the land so like this
mountain<00:01:42.720> region<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.860> see

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
mountain region here then if you can see

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
mountain region here then if you can see
the<00:01:44.159> exper<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> middle<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the exper like in the middle of the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.310 
the exper like in the middle of the
screen<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:47.070> yeah<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.549> mountain<00:01:48.180> region<00:01:48.720> got

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
screen but yeah that mountain region got

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920 
screen but yeah that mountain region got
rivers<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.420> too<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
rivers here I'm not too sure what that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.490 
rivers here I'm not too sure what that
is<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:52.680> starvation

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
is this your starvation

won't know that yeah I did alright the
world<00:04:24.090> map<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.290> can<00:04:25.440> see<00:04:25.800> if<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.460> move<00:04:26.729> to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
world map as you can see if I move to

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.450 
world map as you can see if I move to
the<00:04:27.090> right<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.360> lot<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.169> region<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.919> slowly

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
the right a lot in the region it slowly

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.779 
the right a lot in the region it slowly
moves<00:04:29.729> over<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:29.970> world<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:32.040> local<00:04:32.310> is

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
moves over the world and the local is

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.870 
moves over the world and the local is
like<00:04:32.970> each<00:04:33.500> it's<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> tiny<00:04:35.039> bit<00:04:35.460> within

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
like each it's like a tiny bit within

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.950 
like each it's like a tiny bit within
each<00:04:36.360> thing<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.580> like<00:04:38.760> there<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.479> can<00:04:39.510> see<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
each thing so like there you can see the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.200 
each thing so like there you can see the
river<00:04:40.350> like<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.160> look<00:04:41.430> there<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.030> river

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
river like if you look there the river

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.150 
river like if you look there the river
actually<00:04:42.600> curves<00:04:42.990> which<00:04:43.410> cannot<00:04:43.740> see<00:04:43.949> on<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
actually curves which cannot see on the

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.370 
actually curves which cannot see on the
region<00:04:44.520> up<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:45.360> river<00:04:45.570> looks<00:04:45.810> straight<00:04:46.139> then

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
region up the river looks straight then

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.870 
region up the river looks straight then
on<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> world<00:04:46.919> map<00:04:47.070> became<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.550> see<00:04:47.760> the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
on the world map became and see the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.000 
on the world map became and see the
river<00:04:48.919> which<00:04:49.919> is<00:04:50.100> quite<00:04:50.430> crazy<00:04:54.169> EMF<00:04:55.169> that's

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
river which is quite crazy EMF that's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.140 
river which is quite crazy EMF that's
like<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> search<00:04:56.580> thing<00:04:57.380> where<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.860> allows<00:04:59.430> you

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
like a search thing where it allows you

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.159 
like a search thing where it allows you
to<00:05:01.100> search<00:05:02.100> for<00:05:02.610> various<00:05:03.150> different<00:05:03.900> like

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
to search for various different like

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:12.469 
to search for various different like
parameters<00:05:05.990> where<00:05:08.570> him<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:11.550> can<00:05:11.789> like<00:05:12.000> yeah

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
parameters where him you can like yeah

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.170 
parameters where him you can like yeah
look<00:05:12.750> for<00:05:12.900> different<00:05:13.200> stuff<00:05:13.500> anyway<00:05:14.099> a<00:05:14.340> flux

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
look for different stuff anyway a flux

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.020 
look for different stuff anyway a flux
tone<00:05:15.479> is<00:05:15.630> basically<00:05:16.139> a<00:05:16.169> gem<00:05:16.590> which<00:05:17.160> we<00:05:17.400> want<00:05:17.610> I

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
tone is basically a gem which we want I

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.029 
tone is basically a gem which we want I
think<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.570> rest<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.990> everything<00:05:19.470> speaks<00:05:19.770> for

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
think the rest of everything speaks for

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.800 
think the rest of everything speaks for
itself<00:05:20.070> won't<00:05:20.760> sort<00:05:21.090> of<00:05:21.150> an<00:05:21.270> average<00:05:21.570> thing

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
itself won't sort of an average thing

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.200 
itself won't sort of an average thing
and<00:05:21.930> aquifers<00:05:22.320> are<00:05:22.560> what<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:23.010> rock<00:05:23.370> was<00:05:23.849> harder

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
and aquifers are what a rock was harder

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.900 
and aquifers are what a rock was harder
to<00:05:24.240> dig<00:05:24.539> through<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.750> think<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.050> contains<00:05:25.380> water

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
to dig through I think it contains water

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.670 
to dig through I think it contains water
so<00:05:26.910> we<00:05:27.030> don't<00:05:27.240> let<00:05:27.389> any<00:05:27.510> other<00:05:27.630> such<00:05:28.080> now<00:05:28.289> I<00:05:28.320> put

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
so we don't let any other such now I put

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.050 
so we don't let any other such now I put
no<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.099> that<00:05:29.660> and<00:05:30.660> everything<00:05:30.930> else<00:05:31.169> is<00:05:31.440> fine

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
no to that and everything else is fine

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.270 
no to that and everything else is fine
so<00:05:33.060> entered<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.870> do<00:05:33.990> search<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.650> spaced<00:05:35.070> it

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
so entered to do search and spaced it

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.210 
so entered to do search and spaced it
done<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:35.880> will<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.090> enter<00:05:36.690> its<00:05:37.260> search<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:37.950> our

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
done so will it enter its search in our

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.420 
done so will it enter its search in our
room<00:05:39.060> 29<00:05:39.360> different<00:05:39.870> settlement<00:05:40.800> locations

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
room 29 different settlement locations

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.120 
room 29 different settlement locations
why<00:05:41.580> it's<00:05:41.760> gotten<00:05:42.150> them<00:05:42.270> up<00:05:42.889> it's<00:05:43.889> going<00:05:44.070> to

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
why it's gotten them up it's going to

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.950 
why it's gotten them up it's going to
try<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.370> find<00:05:44.610> as<00:05:44.789> one<00:05:44.970> there's<00:05:45.360> many<00:05:45.660> more

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
try and find as one there's many more

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.690 
try and find as one there's many more
there's<00:05:46.260> like<00:05:46.380> near<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.740> infinite<00:05:47.370> there's<00:05:47.610> a

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
there's like near it infinite there's a

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.379 
there's like near it infinite there's a
crazy<00:05:48.060> amount<00:05:49.820> but<00:05:50.820> it's<00:05:50.970> just<00:05:51.180> having

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
crazy amount but it's just having

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.690 
crazy amount but it's just having
trouble<00:05:51.510> moment<00:05:52.080> finding<00:05:52.470> one<00:05:52.680> with<00:05:52.919> not<00:05:53.280> much

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
trouble moment finding one with not much

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.159 
trouble moment finding one with not much
even<00:05:55.880> once<00:05:56.880> again<00:05:57.180> I'm<00:05:57.270> afraid<00:05:57.510> about<00:05:57.599> FPS

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
even once again I'm afraid about FPS

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.469 
even once again I'm afraid about FPS
here<00:05:58.470> that's<00:05:59.039> not<00:05:59.310> too<00:05:59.699> bad<00:05:59.729> I<00:05:59.970> could<00:06:00.240> live

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
here that's not too bad I could live

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.679 
here that's not too bad I could live
with<00:06:00.510> it

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
with it

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.799 
with it
and<00:06:03.289> apparently<00:06:03.860> was<00:06:04.219> found<00:06:04.519> one<00:06:04.789> it's<00:06:05.539> just

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:05.809 
and apparently was found one it's just

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.019 
and apparently was found one it's just
searching<00:06:06.349> through<00:06:06.619> the<00:06:06.649> other<00:06:06.889> just<00:06:07.219> to<00:06:07.429> make

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
searching through the other just to make

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.749 
searching through the other just to make
sure<00:06:08.059> there's<00:06:08.569> nothing<00:06:08.719> better<00:06:09.549> that's<00:06:10.549> why<00:06:10.699> i

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
sure there's nothing better that's why i

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.609 
sure there's nothing better that's why i
think<00:06:10.819> i<00:06:10.999> may<00:06:11.149> have<00:06:11.179> time<00:06:11.449> to<00:06:11.839> looking<00:06:12.409> at<00:06:12.529> the

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:12.619 
think i may have time to looking at the

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:17.889
