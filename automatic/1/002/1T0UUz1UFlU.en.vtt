00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello friends and welcome another video tutorial 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.850
 on this day 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.940
 is very well pointed out how they can play original wii games who have 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.069
 of an update 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:14.169
 I want to tell you with that 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.399
 is when the game asks you to update your wii console 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.199
 We are going to learn 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.939
 to play the game 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.360
 tape updated our wii console what we're going to see is skip the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.449
 upgrade 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.930
 start playing our game without any 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 this is what we are going to do is this application called 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.140
 which is defining to measure it 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.270
 from Havana you can load 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.270
 the link of the download this is the description of the video 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.040
 lavenir compressed a chibola reassured them to leave 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
 this folder called art 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.280
 what we're going to do this ex-prisoner until he showed himself very 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 and insert it in our pc 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 we do not open 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 and we're going to go to the folder 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.070
 inside the folder 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 let's move the folder that we downloaded 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.870
 I see that not because I have it 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.870
 end as we have passed we propose homes 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940
 extreme brings us reinvents itself 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.300
 and we insert in our country 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.510
 and we go to Luis to see how this application works 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.850
 a basket this game which contains a update 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.790
 this game is him 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 guaia a judge 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.370
 for beney the game is asking me to update my console 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.880
 to play it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.500
 but only as we want to see it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 we're going to be pointed out john birch years 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
 just start 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.879
 let's find the application called deco 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.449
 the silicone moss and we give it career 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.499
 we take off also to that they lack 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:37.770
 the list 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.770
 and will give us the first option that says the uci 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869
 Alberto knows how to read the game 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.049
 we have to wait a bit 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.299
 uu there is the body 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.599
 already entered without need and updated that kills and not just one 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.009
 works 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.009
 usually 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.900
 I just want the only thing they have to do every time they want to play 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.939
 a game that brought an update 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.199
 because that goes into the chanel bottom and they use application 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.379
 as a whole it works well 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.379
 entered retail 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.729
