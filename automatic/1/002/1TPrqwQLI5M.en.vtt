00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.449 
seed all right well I'm not doubting you
at<00:03:44.290> all<00:03:44.440> I'm<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.650> playing<00:03:45.010> devil's<00:03:45.220> advocate

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
at all I'm just playing devil's advocate

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.100 
at all I'm just playing devil's advocate
for<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.910> second<00:03:46.300> what<00:03:46.420> about<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.750> fact<00:03:46.959> that

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
for a second what about the fact that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.449 
for a second what about the fact that
you<00:03:47.290> know<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> Titans<00:03:47.890> did<00:03:48.070> fire<00:03:48.250> their

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
you know the Titans did fire their

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.860 
you know the Titans did fire their
offensive<00:03:48.730> coordinator<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.480> maybe<00:03:49.630> we'll<00:03:49.780> get

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
offensive coordinator so maybe we'll get

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.340 
offensive coordinator so maybe we'll get
a<00:03:49.930> little<00:03:50.170> bit<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.470> rejuvenated<00:03:51.220> offense

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
a little bit of a rejuvenated offense

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.780 
a little bit of a rejuvenated offense
because<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.010> they<00:03:54.130> do<00:03:54.190> have<00:03:54.519> you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
because of that and they do have you

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.090 
because of that and they do have you
know<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:55.090> lot<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.840> offensive<00:03:56.170> weapons<00:03:56.380> quit<00:03:56.980> it

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
know a lot of offensive weapons quit it

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.500 
know a lot of offensive weapons quit it
would<00:03:57.190> never<00:03:57.370> be<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.610> surprise<00:03:58.060> if<00:03:58.090> chris

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
would never be a surprise if chris

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.150 
would never be a surprise if chris
johnson<00:03:58.900> rushes<00:03:59.080> for<00:03:59.350> 200<00:03:59.709> yards<00:03:59.830> in<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.130> game

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
johnson rushes for 200 yards in a game

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.860 
johnson rushes for 200 yards in a game
and<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.610> know<00:04:00.790> two<00:04:00.850> touchdowns<00:04:01.450> or<00:04:01.630> whatever

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
the NFL is a lot of points so all those

the NFL is a lot of points so all those
things<00:04:06.100> combined<00:04:06.430> doesn't<00:04:06.730> make<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:07.000> a

little bit nervous not really because I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640 
little bit nervous not really because I
mean<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.540> don't<00:04:10.780> think<00:04:10.930> off<00:04:11.019> its<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.230> coordinator

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650

was tripping guys in the sideline or

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.110 
was tripping guys in the sideline or
hang<00:04:14.200> all<00:04:14.530> plays<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.010> cost<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.400> job<00:04:15.610> it's

every<00:04:20.260> week<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.950> don't<00:04:21.430> think<00:04:21.609> it's<00:04:21.729> always

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
every week so I don't think it's always

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.330 
every week so I don't think it's always
the<00:04:22.090> coordinators<00:04:22.600> fault<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:24.190> know<00:04:24.310> I

the coordinators fault and you know I

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.210 
the coordinators fault and you know I
think<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.270> think<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.350> my<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:27.130> know

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220
