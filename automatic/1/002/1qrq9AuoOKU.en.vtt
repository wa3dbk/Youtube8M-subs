an<00:00:52.260> expansion<00:00:52.739> after<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.870> thing<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
an expansion after all the thing is that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.630 
an expansion after all the thing is that
I've<00:00:55.379> been<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.800> much<00:00:55.980> faster<00:00:56.399> layers

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I've been going for much faster layers

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
I've been going for much faster layers
lately<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.449> due<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.739> that's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
lately so that's due to you know that's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
lately so that's due to you know that's
that's<00:00:59.070> part<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> problem<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.350> think<00:01:01.350> we

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that's part of the problem I think we

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.969 
that's part of the problem I think we
should<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.710> okay<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:03.530> nothing<00:01:04.530> too<00:01:04.650> scary

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
should be okay here nothing too scary

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.620 
should be okay here nothing too scary
with<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> stick<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.939> our<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.150> Bay's<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.479> enough

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
with a stick on our two Bay's me enough

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.740 
with a stick on our two Bay's me enough
for<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:07.909> which<00:01:08.909> seems<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
for now which seems to be one of the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
for now which seems to be one of the
most<00:01:09.930> popular<00:01:10.170> strategies<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
most popular strategies right now at the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.060 
most popular strategies right now at the
highest<00:01:11.430> level<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> play<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> bit<00:01:12.930> birgit<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
highest level of play a bit birgit so I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
highest level of play a bit birgit so I
haven't<00:01:14.369> seen<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> third<00:01:14.820> command<00:01:15.119> center<00:01:15.360> from

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
haven't seen a third command center from

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.090 
haven't seen a third command center from
my<00:01:15.630> opponent<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.080> I've<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.710> seen<00:01:16.920> any

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
my opponent but I've also not seen any

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.090 
my opponent but I've also not seen any
kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.900> been<00:01:18.900> chief<00:01:19.170> shenanigans<00:01:19.650> yet<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
kind of been chief shenanigans yet the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
kind of been chief shenanigans yet the
Banshees<00:01:20.400> would<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.640> definitely<00:01:20.820> been<00:01:21.180> out

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
Banshees would have definitely been out

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.780 
Banshees would have definitely been out
already<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.189> confusing<00:01:23.400> at

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
already so this is kind of confusing at

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.149 
already so this is kind of confusing at
this<00:01:23.909> point<00:01:24.200> I'm<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.439> dare<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> put<00:01:26.009> down<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this point I'm gonna dare to put down a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
this point I'm gonna dare to put down a
little<00:01:26.400> bit<00:01:26.580> more<00:01:26.790> creep<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.890> maybe<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> little

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
little bit more creep but maybe a little

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
little bit more creep but maybe a little
create<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:30.180> greedy<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.540> would<00:01:30.780> maybe<00:01:30.960> be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
create a little greedy I would maybe be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.569 
create a little greedy I would maybe be
better<00:01:31.350> off<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:31.799> saving<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.310> energy

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
better off right now saving some energy

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.990 
better off right now saving some energy
instead<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.490> already<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
instead but we have already put down a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.359 
instead but we have already put down a
Greek<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> verse<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.009> no<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.189> turning

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
Greek to verse now so no more turning

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
Greek to verse now so no more turning
back<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.270> gonna<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> big<00:01:39.750> round<00:01:40.049> of

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:34.890 
almost completely okay can I have to
look<00:02:33.760> around<00:02:33.849> see<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:34.299> my<00:02:34.390> opponent<00:02:34.569> is<00:02:34.810> up

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
look around see what my opponent is up

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660 
look around see what my opponent is up
to<00:02:35.019> obviously<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.340> pretty<00:02:36.489> good

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
to obviously but this is pretty good

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.429 
to obviously but this is pretty good
gonna<00:02:37.180> end<00:02:37.329> up<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.659> for<00:02:37.840> my<00:02:37.959> own<00:02:38.079> other

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
gonna end up going for my own other

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.789 
gonna end up going for my own other
based<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> think<00:02:41.469> we're<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.709> to

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
based on and I think we're going to

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.830 
based on and I think we're going to
think<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.359> transitioning<00:02:43.359> to<00:02:43.510> watch<00:02:43.689> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
think about transitioning to watch the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.089 
think about transitioning to watch the
high<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.409> well<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.650> i<00:02:44.829> can<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.189> for<00:02:47.099> ultra

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
high here as well so i can go for ultra

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.130 
high here as well so i can go for ultra
lights<00:02:48.250> later<00:02:48.489> on<00:02:48.640> into<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.909> game<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.299> guess

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
lights later on into the game I guess

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.569 
lights later on into the game I guess
we'll<00:02:50.260> make<00:02:50.439> some<00:02:50.590> extra<00:02:50.799> banelings<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.430> well

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
we'll make some extra banelings as well

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.190 
we'll make some extra banelings as well
just<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:51.939> safety's<00:02:52.390> sake<00:02:52.569> because<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.989> don't

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
just in safety's sake because I don't

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.619 
just in safety's sake because I don't
really<00:02:53.349> have<00:02:53.439> any<00:02:53.739> ok<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.060> timing<00:02:55.420> attack

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
really have any ok so this timing attack

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.089 
really have any ok so this timing attack
right<00:02:55.810> here<00:02:55.959> basically<00:02:56.170> will<00:02:56.560> prove<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.980> us

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
right here basically will prove to us

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.890 
right here basically will prove to us
whether<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.519> we<00:02:57.670> were<00:02:57.849> too<00:02:58.180> greedy<00:02:58.420> or<00:02:58.659> if

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
whether or not we were too greedy or if

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.780 
whether or not we were too greedy or if
we<00:02:59.109> played<00:02:59.650> ok<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:01.829> think<00:03:02.829> we<00:03:03.010> played<00:03:03.220> ok<00:03:03.519> i<00:03:03.700> will

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
we played ok I think we played ok i will

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.619 
we played ok I think we played ok i will
have<00:03:04.180> my<00:03:04.510> +1<00:03:04.989> +1<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.739> bailing<00:03:06.159> speed<00:03:06.430> done<00:03:06.669> so

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
have my +1 +1 and bailing speed done so

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:43.700 
have my +1 +1 and bailing speed done so
this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:08.049> good<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.900> lease<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.200> Queen

but also some more ultralisk right there
