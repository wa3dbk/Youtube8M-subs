00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.380
 perfect 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.429

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.429
 a bow but good for you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.940
 dark diamond god 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.870
 sometimes we climb better to the front 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.790
 and also buy here 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 I do not think this map has very little 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.260
 buy the medium 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.260
 how strange is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.290
 and that 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.800
 level 5 they want to sing it, it's worth it 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.010
 in grasping the arch level 2 power 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 universal the grau 2 seriously 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.550
 my mother, my uncle 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.000
 we go up where we lower the memories 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.000
 here 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.069
 someone is coming outside but I think 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:15.260
 that we can with it here percent 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:18.220
 here there were stairs where yes but this 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.220
 It goes up as it is 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.900
 because he lost hearts that he rejected me 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.370
 what I do not have but I have a stack and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.100
 arrow beak since I have a bow 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.420
 power an operative that I already had up to and 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.950

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:54.200

 it's good to be here 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.650
 but here 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.050

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.580

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.830

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.860
