00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.960 
you want to come right on top of it and
then<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:42.240> want<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> select<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.930> polygon<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
then you want to select the polygon and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.060 
then you want to select the polygon and
so<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.209> select<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.380> top<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
so you can select all the top of it and

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.040 
so you can select all the top of it and
then<00:02:47.190> delete<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.360> inside<00:02:48.690> of

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
then delete it so we have the inside of

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.710 
then delete it so we have the inside of
the<00:02:49.110> glass<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:51.540> around

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the glass so you just want to go around

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.479 
the glass so you just want to go around
and<00:02:52.580> select<00:02:54.050> all<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.739> then<00:02:56.220> press

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and select all of it and then press

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.210 
and select all of it and then press
Delete<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.239> then<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.620> inside<00:02:59.070> of

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
Delete and then you have the inside of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.370 
Delete and then you have the inside of
the<00:02:59.310> martini<00:02:59.700> glass<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:04.340> now<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:06.380> might

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the martini glass so now if you might

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
the martini glass so now if you might
want<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> get<00:03:07.709> some<00:03:07.950> lights<00:03:10.040> drag<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.220> light

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
want to get some lights drag the light

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.280 
want to get some lights drag the light
up<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.790> bit<00:03:13.760> get<00:03:14.760> another<00:03:15.000> light<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:15.780> come<00:03:16.140> on

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
up a bit get another light so come on

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.830 
up a bit get another light so come on
see<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.130> be

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.110 

maybe<00:03:25.350> even<00:03:25.890> another<00:03:26.760> one<00:03:27.620> put<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.880> don't

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
maybe even another one put it you don't

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.980 
maybe even another one put it you don't
want<00:03:30.300> too<00:03:30.600> many<00:03:33.440> shadows<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.750> we're

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
want too many shadows and then we're

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.190 
want too many shadows and then we're
gonna<00:03:37.140> create<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:38.600> glass<00:03:39.600> texture<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.400> ivory

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
gonna create the glass texture so ivory

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.640 
gonna create the glass texture so ivory
saved<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.950> I'm<00:03:44.069> just<00:03:44.130> gonna<00:03:45.020> look<00:03:46.020> open<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
saved it so I'm just gonna look open it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.820 
saved it so I'm just gonna look open it
up<00:03:46.910> open<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.430> want<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.670> make<00:03:50.880> it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
up open and so if you want to make it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.030 
up open and so if you want to make it
you<00:03:52.830> want<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.130> go<00:03:53.310> into<00:03:54.020> transparency<00:03:55.040> we're

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
you want to go into transparency we're

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.520 
you want to go into transparency we're
gonna<00:03:56.160> put<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.430> brightness<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.940> 95%<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.140> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
gonna put the brightness on 95% and the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.390 
gonna put the brightness on 95% and the
refraction<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.310> 1.2%<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.040> then<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.160> want<00:04:02.340> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
refraction on 1.2% and then you want to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.870 
refraction on 1.2% and then you want to
go<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.630> reflection<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:07.519> just<00:04:08.519> want<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
go to reflection and you just want to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.770 
go to reflection and you just want to
keep<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.780> brightness<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.410> 100%<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.780> make

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
keep the brightness on 100% and make

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.590 
keep the brightness on 100% and make
sure<00:04:12.930> it's<00:04:13.080> ticked<00:04:13.410> on<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.370> then<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.540> to

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
sure it's ticked on and then you want to

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.830 
sure it's ticked on and then you want to
go<00:04:15.720> down<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.049> specular<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:18.239> want<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.630> put

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
go down to specular and you want to put

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.270 
go down to specular and you want to put
the<00:04:18.959> brightness<00:04:19.320> on<00:04:19.470> 60%<00:04:20.370> then<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.150> want<00:04:21.390> to

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
the brightness on 60% then you want to

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.920 
the brightness on 60% then you want to
change<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.580> texture<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.690> Fresno<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:27.630> mix

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
change the texture to Fresno the mix

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.070 
change the texture to Fresno the mix
strength<00:04:28.320> on<00:04:28.620> 60%<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.940> then<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:30.540> want<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.840> put

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
strength on 60% and then you want to put

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.870 
strength on 60% and then you want to put
the<00:04:32.300> width<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.630> 37<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.560> higher<00:04:34.770> on<00:04:34.950> 78<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
the width on 37 the higher on 78 the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.600 
the width on 37 the higher on 78 the
fall-off<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:37.140> can<00:04:37.320> leave<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.680> on<00:04:37.800> zero<00:04:38.220> and

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
fall-off you can leave it on zero and

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.260 
fall-off you can leave it on zero and
put<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.910> inner<00:04:39.120> wet<00:04:39.390> on<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.870> 15<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.970> in<00:04:41.970> the

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
put the inner wet on a 15 and in the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.230 
put the inner wet on a 15 and in the
color<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:43.440> want<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.710> not<00:04:44.310> do<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> dark<00:04:44.880> for<00:04:45.150> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
color you want to not do a dark for you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.900 
color you want to not do a dark for you
cuz<00:04:45.419> then<00:04:45.630> all<00:04:45.840> come<00:04:46.080> out<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.919> dark<00:04:47.610> blue

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
cuz then all come out just a dark blue

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.490 
cuz then all come out just a dark blue
glass<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.630> there<00:04:48.750> unless<00:04:49.140> that's<00:04:49.320> what

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
glass and there unless that's what

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.350 
glass and there unless that's what
you're<00:04:49.680> looking<00:04:49.979> for<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:50.940> want<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.270> go

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
you're looking for so you want to go

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.070 
you're looking for so you want to go
into<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.600> lighter<00:04:52.020> color<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:53.539> then<00:04:54.539> you<00:04:54.900> want

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
into a lighter color and then you want

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.710 
into a lighter color and then you want
to<00:04:55.140> press<00:04:55.500> ok<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:55.890> close<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:57.450> then<00:04:57.600> you

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
to press ok and close that and then you

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.860 
to press ok and close that and then you
can<00:04:57.840> apply<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.640> material<00:04:59.640> to<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.030> glass<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
can apply the material to the glass and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.760 
can apply the material to the glass and
then<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:01.650> we<00:05:01.830> render<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:03.440> that's<00:05:04.440> what<00:05:04.680> it

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
then if we render it that's what it

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.029 
then if we render it that's what it
looks<00:05:04.979> like<00:05:07.520> but<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:10.500> make<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.860> look

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
looks like but you to make it look

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.920 
looks like but you to make it look
better<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:12.479> need<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.660> get<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.840> floor<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.780> you

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
better you need to get a floor and you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.820 
better you need to get a floor and you
just<00:05:16.110> need<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:17.360> rotate<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:19.340> around<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:21.830> then

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
just need to rotate it around and then

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.430 
just need to rotate it around and then
rotate<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.430> 90<00:05:24.240> degrees<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.050> want<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.200> hold

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
rotate it 90 degrees so you want a hold

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.230 
rotate it 90 degrees so you want a hold
shift<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.160> it'll<00:05:26.430> go<00:05:26.640> up<00:05:26.669> in<00:05:27.060> tens<00:05:27.419> or<00:05:27.919> fives

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.610 

okay

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
okay
