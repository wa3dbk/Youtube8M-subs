00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 each 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.449
 six months 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.449
 and you 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.989
 that you 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.140
 even before 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.570
 never watched pilot passing for example can not happen 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.239
 its recent that she is the affiliation to pdt 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.210
 You belong politically if you intend to enter the public career. 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 only if it's to be a government candidate 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.180
 the french senate 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.910
 in two seats next year, the North American ctt fleet of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.860
 preventive health 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.270
 to moderate 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.470
 in relation to the criticisms that you can program with the sefaz 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.030
 about 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.220
 trapping 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.480
 spectacular year I titi opposite spectacular spectacular social life 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.620
 how do you view this type of customer in a good 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.250
 so you have to be criticized 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.050
 this new visa solution is great 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.790
 I think every criticism in life 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.810
 It's interesting because if you 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 the shows a reality the prices suggested sit 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 it shows a tragedy 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 is moving people on the basis of the residence program on behalf of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.030
 people because they have no inventory problem shows us what happens there 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.540
 out 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.920
 and in relation to the year 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 there was a change in the club is one of the changes is selected 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.950
 the appeal of the population way we do not lie 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.350
 if you discuss politics in the neighborhoods 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.360
 formerly people gathered in the savings test an entire country 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330
 proposes a cause 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.200
 the sudden not exaggeration 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.320
 What is your opinion about this change? 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.140
 the project is identical so the two companies close the round cearÃ¡ 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.140
 I in my program called the super toucan starts as a product of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.829
 little angel 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.740
 it is not true 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.579
 are very interesting things 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.529
 so I think 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.009
 we went to globalization 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.619
 which changed the thinking of every municipality o with the question of 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:17.959
 safety 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.129
 caused the citizen to become five more municipalities 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.319
 He's over weight, forget it. 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.409
 Asia's population information is from the site a faster source 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.299
 even if you have today 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.379
 The internet you have today. 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 we go by person and televisions at discounts did it wrong 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.779
 three hundred and we have been dying part of that money second half 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.639
 this information this amount of information here has much 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.209
 the net generation said that in children in haiti already know 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.869
 surf the internet in a way 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.689
 only with the professional 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.339
 so I guess that caused him to change not to be intimidated arrested by the prosecution 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.439
 of past time 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.719
 Do you think that kind of problem is what you do 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.500
 this is 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.970
 for example that there are many people who think that increased pessimism increased 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.419
 op - depression is the right word 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.329
 do you think it contributes 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.269
 as if this would oblige the PT its society program 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.340
 I find this taste interesting. 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.959
 people with talking that she contributes to pressure to sunbathe 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.680
 morning and should provide an organized test vehicles in the world ends 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.039
 spouting away sp cup something better 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.439
 I lost normal time now because he does not talk to the block to people or 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.829
 similar when the college people with basic basket the eight families 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.020
 is that the whole problem is only clear that in the sixth position should put the name 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.230
 of the father she is born from the birth of a child what to speak 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.929
 I Want to speak 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:04.189
 reporting that she is a member of the player marked the return of the emperor 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.460
 Even more 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.560
 is very very easy and to the stage a hot one that has 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.309
 literally speaking 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:13.789
 in the short term 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.650
 only thanks a lot the centrists will bring 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.419
 still on site
