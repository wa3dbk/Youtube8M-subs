00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
boiling you keep mixing it this probably

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.100 
boiling you keep mixing it this probably
won't<00:01:44.770> be<00:01:45.100> not<00:01:45.430> compound<00:01:46.180> mixture<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.899> turn

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
won't be not compound mixture to turn

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.290 
won't be not compound mixture to turn
this<00:01:47.289> into<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.680> science<00:01:47.970> still<00:01:48.970> going<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.210> be<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
this into a science still going to be a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.380 
this into a science still going to be a
liquid<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.310> may<00:01:51.550> need<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.910> do<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:52.360> the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
liquid so you may need to do is do the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.620 
liquid so you may need to do is do the
same<00:01:52.810> thing<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.410> just<00:01:53.740> up<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:55.179> put<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.539> in

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
same thing that just up and put it in

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.800 
same thing that just up and put it in
again<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:57.100> need<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.399> be<00:01:57.490> careful<00:01:57.729> because<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
again we need to be careful because the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.469 
again we need to be careful because the
cornflour<00:01:59.320> mixture<00:01:59.710> doesn't<00:02:00.550> act<00:02:00.789> instantly

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
cornflour mixture doesn't act instantly

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.660 
cornflour mixture doesn't act instantly
as<00:02:01.750> soon<00:02:01.960> as<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.200> put<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.410> in<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:03.340> takes<00:02:03.550> a

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
as soon as you put it in it takes a

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.560 
as soon as you put it in it takes a
while<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.240> react<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.899> sauce<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.729> steep

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
while to react to the sauce so steep

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.160 
while to react to the sauce so steep
mixing<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.489> eating<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:09.929> slowly<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
mixing it up eating it slowly the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.930 
mixing it up eating it slowly the
temperature's<00:02:11.769> rising<00:02:11.800> inside<00:02:12.670> that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
temperature's rising inside that

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.410 
temperature's rising inside that
saucepan<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:14.459> slowly<00:02:15.459> you'll<00:02:15.850> get<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> nice

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
saucepan and slowly you'll get a nice

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.310 
saucepan and slowly you'll get a nice
sauce<00:02:17.170> building<00:02:17.769> up<00:02:17.890> inside<00:02:18.070> there<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> I'll

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
sauce building up inside there so I'll

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.420 
sauce building up inside there so I'll
do<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.890> keep<00:02:21.130> mixing<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:22.000> around<00:02:22.090> until

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
do is just keep mixing it around until

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.430 
do is just keep mixing it around until
the<00:02:24.430> sauce<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.480> background<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.170> get

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
the sauce is just the background you get

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.620 
the sauce is just the background you get
sauce<00:02:26.799> texture<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.670> it

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
need to do it's not thickening up and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.670 
need to do it's not thickening up and
off<00:04:59.890> put<00:05:00.400> bit<00:05:00.580> more<00:05:00.730> confiar<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.690> with<00:05:02.650> the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
off put bit more confiar in it with the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.490 
off put bit more confiar in it with the
water<00:05:03.070> mixture<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.970> now<00:05:04.660> taking<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.170> lot<00:05:05.470> more

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
water mixture and now taking a lot more

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.680 
water mixture and now taking a lot more
but<00:05:06.040> remember<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.820> leave<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.090> gap<00:05:07.450> between

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
but remember to leave a gap between

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.850 
but remember to leave a gap between
adding<00:05:08.650> calm<00:05:09.070> next<00:05:09.550> year<00:05:09.730> because<00:05:10.510> it<00:05:11.410> takes<00:05:11.680> a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
adding calm next year because it takes a

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.720 
adding calm next year because it takes a
while<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.370> calm<00:05:12.640> mixture<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:14.340> take<00:05:15.340> react

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
while to calm mixture to take react

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.500 
while to calm mixture to take react
really<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:18.540> as<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.840> keep<00:05:20.020> me<00:05:20.080> off<00:05:21.510> evaporates

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
really and as you keep me off evaporates

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.410 
really and as you keep me off evaporates
and<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.230> becomes<00:05:23.470> thicker<00:05:23.800> anyway<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.850> don't

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
and it becomes thicker anyway so I don't

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:37.110 
and it becomes thicker anyway so I don't
our<00:05:25.630> too<00:05:25.900> much<00:05:26.110> fun<00:05:26.410> extra<00:05:26.950> into<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.340> mixture

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.020 

once<00:05:37.810> your<00:05:38.020> sauce<00:05:38.260> mixture<00:05:39.160> becomes<00:05:39.639> thick

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
once your sauce mixture becomes thick

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.250 
once your sauce mixture becomes thick
enough<00:05:40.770> just<00:05:41.770> their<00:05:41.949> liking<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.699> need<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.840> then
