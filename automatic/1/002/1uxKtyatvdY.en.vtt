00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.550
 if it is true it is a difficult time 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:09.620
 we are having a difficult time 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.840
 but good I have 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.980
 something experience fall into this that is the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.439
 soccer these moments 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.039
 they end up working as we are 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.599
 doing 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.900
 with the predisposition that we are 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.560
 doing 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.030
 I think we 're going to get it right for the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.730
 Thursday's match 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.540
 and definitely at some point 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 it has to be finished 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 we know and we are aware of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 what of what we are living but the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.920
 group is also aware that everything 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.240
 early of this bad streak is going to have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 to finish not if not to win obviously 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.360
 it's complicated sometimes we're doing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.920
 our soccer 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.720
 we are at times we are doing 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 our football what we want what 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.910
 we want to do on the court we put it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.340
 well at times not but obviously the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 the result that the end of the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.210
 let's say that is the most important thing in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.700
 football is giving us in the cup if 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.250
 it is definitely a key match 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.250
 key we definitely have to win 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 to stay alive in the tournament that what 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 we have very clear what we have talked about and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.530
 we know that it is a very important match 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 let's hope that people continue to trust 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.940
 we have that the fan varied 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 they trust that the university fan 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.330
 is going to encourage us to support 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.250
 we need your encouragement of your support 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.600
 because it is a very important match 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.270
 and as I say we are doing 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.220
 our part all the efforts to 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.180
 get out of this bad situation and we want 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.460
 that on Thursday 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.380
 let's go ahead let's take forward the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.320
 party that is a tough match in the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.600
 swollen is understandable does not want 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.930
 wants his team to win and good to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.240
 Sometimes these bad moments happen 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.580
 and anxiety is understandable and 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.920
 criticism of the fan but as I repeat 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.850
 we know that we have to do 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.100
 our match on Thursdays 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.660
 intelligently before a tough opponent in 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.910
 the tournament that does not have to face the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.729
 1 is a greatest team Peru 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.970
 and you have to show why in 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.500
 any type of tournament is just 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.150
 that not your hierarchy is your greatness 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.310
 pitifully 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.810
 is not touching having a good time and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.720
 good 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.670
 in the Inca cup we are not aware of the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.200
 bad moment that we are passing the group 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.030
 he is strong 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.799
 we are training the truth is the best 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.079
 way I see an attitude a desire to 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.540
 want to get out of this bad time I think 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.459
 that the team when it enters the court 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.980
 we all all throw for the same place 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.939
 for the same purpose simply that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.939
 it's a bad time 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.670
 there's no guy that sometimes out there 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.380
 I can read in some media there is no 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.190
 no kind of vision in any kind of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.080
 good annoyance 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.290
 the logical annoyance of the results that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.810
 they do not happen but we know that football is 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.450
 well and that at some point we will win 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.640
 so we are training as I say 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.530
 well let's hope that on Thursday the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.460
 swollen can continue to support us and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.460
 make a good match
