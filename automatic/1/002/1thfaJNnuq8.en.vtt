 coordination of different trades allowed to offer prizes 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.220
 moderate they are rationally distributed 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.250

 recorded at 6 6 euros you will find testimonials of the time 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.040
 on these dwellings it is well designed 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.330

 wages the desert deserts 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.250
 it was awful 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.290
 the truth but nothing at all 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.630
 a small haircut bus that I believe it's gone I think I'm 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.200
 sure that passes is to feed us case by little 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.960
 was built in sweeper 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.000
 a tobacconist's office had a lady who started to ride it begging him and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 wool and wind from the rain 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.399
 the tall buildings and side came out of earthworks the wii 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.290

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.610
 with that 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.500
 the kids went up with their water losses 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.620
 oh yes it was the first time we saw things like that there was I 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.090
 am there when there was the foot near 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.429

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.099
 children but hey 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.700

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.499
 in Europe 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:28.510
 this one there how it's called enlightened it fell that made me 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.869
 still something finally why reportage never lived 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 what were the best years for you in this neighborhood 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.629
 obviously the side I got because my kids were small 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.080
 this agreement with me ol 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080
 because I am a real mother hen and what were the worst 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.569
 we do not come back I'll see worse things for kiabi 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.539
 it's always the same chavez 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:52.760
 a family 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.789

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.739
 buds 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.189
 and with all that is said we bind all the beautiful things that are 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.889
 are currently building and what you think an improvement in 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.089
 the atmosphere 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.299
 finally i hope yes 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.299
 head a small and sea like an average duration 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.109
 I would like there to be something at the social center for seniors committed 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:14.709
 10 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.009
 this is a little after 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.799
 obliged to go young if I was looking for 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.439
 pettitte resulted in the afternoon 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.799
 very creative 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.129
 do you feel safe 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.049

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.929
 marked to me I do not leave the choice fault on not the night 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.799
 or so accompanied but good 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.799
 many but the day have never dared 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.659
 they do not fear anyone you are five or ten years old 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.819
 just more humane on Thursday tough market day saturday 6 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.549
 to accommodate all nationalities 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.469
 we can all live together the sun shines for everyone do not 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.579
 start 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.459
 you are a restaurateur at the edge of the neighborhood of sizzling near the 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.569
 Clemenceau district 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.509
 did you observe a real evolution of the neighborhood in recent 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:00.399
 years 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.519
 we are in southern Ekkadi 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.819
 two years 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.789
 votes 23% 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.769
 the environment has completely changed 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.769
 still 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.629
 did you hesitate to settle here 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:18.779
 let's say we were on the project 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 we expect kolda acts 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.740
 and when we have as project Sunday during the race 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.960
 can we say that there is always insecurity felt in the neighborhood 

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.990
 Unfortunately yes 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.990
 for these last rounds 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.490
 their big party 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.590
 for his next 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.819
 and now 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.340
 but still 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.389
 do you know gold 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.349
 he is notably victim mayor of Dijon from 1940 to 1942 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.289
 it's also the name of a dissident six buildings sizzled his 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.180
 construction was completed in 1959 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.110
 but he will barely have time to celebrate his 50 years since in February 2010 he 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.469
 also will become dust after ricky ray he is the leader so there is 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.900
 as you see on these pictures we did a trick in his ten titles 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:13.970
 provisional 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.559
 half a century of life 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.110
 an atmosphere 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.680
 General de Gaulle is no longer there but other people are hurrying 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.680
 today at the turn of other model caravel 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.770

 the health insurance fund cnfpt new housing 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.620
 but finally 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.480
 what will we say about all this 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.520
 in 2059 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.520
 medusa 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.349
 Why 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.960
 to review 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.659
 reading 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.759
 in cold weather 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.759
 it's rare 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:59.849
 at the restaurant 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.189
 m 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.339

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.759
 to read before leaving shares the optimism of the inhabitants of the neighborhood 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.660
 you have lived in the neighborhood for a number of years 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.960
 for two years yesterday you watched the evolution of thomas brigaud district 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.770

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.279
 but that's how a home and country we like all the same 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.789
 past 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.800
 to a media there are stops 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.339
 we can hope for it but 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.339
 and then that's what you feel safe in the neighborhood 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:48.889
 Yes, yes and yes 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.149
 the world is back 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:54.229
 net debt 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.729
 the captain 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.680
 the first one is very good for you the district of the halls what would it be 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:05.319
 I do not know what she did at first 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.050
 he had been arrested 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.199
 but in the middle of the restaurant was beautiful 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:12.369
 we did not have the opportunity to go 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:14.699
 he asked for everything not to be thrown 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:15.949
 it's awesome sc 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:17.349
 and these protesters 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:19.369
 you want to stay in brazil 

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:22.749
 Well, of course, the neighborhood of sizzles evolves for you 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.360
 since for maintenance evolve in medium 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.680
 players 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.449
 for his security witness 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.979
 quite i live rue berthelot 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:40.119

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:41.689
 widow of cardiff 

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:44.739
 and for you the demolitions of buildings under construction will be a 

00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:45.939
 importance yes 

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:47.419
 but because 10% 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.339
 the constructions is drawing is much smaller 

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.490
 so necessarily to adapt to the wind 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.690
 thirteen people on the spot several human relationships between the players 

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.949
 and even 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:02.680
 we still have a little bit each one at home to them our photo what is 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.499
 past 

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:06.289
 in the district des halles 

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:07.169
 the verdict is severe
