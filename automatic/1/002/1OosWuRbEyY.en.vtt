00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.699 
she has shown on it it's not this side
though<00:02:55.690> my<00:02:56.690> believe<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.319> made<00:02:57.500> out<00:02:57.530> of

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
though my believe this is made out of

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.930 
though my believe this is made out of
alone<00:02:58.450> though<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.700> like

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
alone though so it's just this like

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.500 
alone though so it's just this like
tossed<00:03:02.299> around<00:03:02.950> same<00:03:03.950> thing<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.370> loo<00:03:05.269> for<00:03:05.480> a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
tossed around same thing is a loo for a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.070 
tossed around same thing is a loo for a
loaf

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
loaf

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.500 
loaf
I<00:03:06.110> think<00:03:06.379> it's<00:03:06.530> aloof<00:03:06.860> loofah<00:03:07.640> bunny<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:08.150> what

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
I think it's aloof loofah bunny is what

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.539 
I think it's aloof loofah bunny is what
it<00:03:08.599> is<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.019> it's<00:03:09.590> obviously<00:03:09.950> made<00:03:10.190> out<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
it is and it's obviously made out of the

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.160 
it is and it's obviously made out of the
loof<00:03:10.730> or<00:03:11.060> loaf<00:03:11.330> or<00:03:11.540> whatever<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.959> want<00:03:12.110> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
loof or loaf or whatever you want to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.110 
loof or loaf or whatever you want to
call<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.440> but<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:12.799> right<00:03:13.010> there<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.519> think

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
call it but it's right there I think

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.699 
call it but it's right there I think
it's<00:03:14.239> albino<00:03:14.569> because<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.200> has<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.319> red<00:03:15.560> eye

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
it's albino because it has a red eye

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.720 
it's albino because it has a red eye

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
a little homemade like out of the two

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.760 
a little homemade like out of the two
second<00:04:23.960> idea<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.560> um<00:04:25.630> all<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:26.690> did<00:04:26.960> was<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.620> it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
second idea and um all I did was I is it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.400 
second idea and um all I did was I is it
tied<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.430> comes<00:04:28.669> in<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.090> out<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:30.200> made

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
tied that it comes in and out and I made

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.580 
tied that it comes in and out and I made
this<00:04:30.530> little<00:04:31.419> house<00:04:32.419> thing<00:04:32.900> she's<00:04:33.200> got<00:04:33.380> in<00:04:33.470> it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
this little house thing she's got in it

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.140 
this little house thing she's got in it
a<00:04:33.620> couple<00:04:33.889> punch<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:34.639> really<00:04:34.789> do<00:04:35.030> it

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
a couple punch and it really do it

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.800 
a couple punch and it really do it
anymore<00:04:35.349> but<00:04:36.349> it<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.970> looks<00:04:37.970> like<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.539> and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
anymore but it just looks like this and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.409 
anymore but it just looks like this and
I<00:04:39.349> made<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.370> two<00:04:40.550> second<00:04:40.849> idea<00:04:41.150> too

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
I made that out of a two second idea too

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.610 
I made that out of a two second idea too
so<00:04:42.520> that's<00:04:43.520> just<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:43.970> block<00:04:44.180> off<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:45.260> she<00:04:45.320> can't

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
so that's just a block off so she can't

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.480 
so that's just a block off so she can't
get<00:04:45.770> out<00:04:45.890> while<00:04:46.310> I'm<00:04:46.550> not<00:04:47.180> out

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
get out while I'm not out

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.900 
get out while I'm not out
