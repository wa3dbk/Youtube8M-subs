you'll<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.180> aerial<00:01:30.930> video<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.619> incredibly

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you'll see aerial video is incredibly

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
you'll see aerial video is incredibly
powerful<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> pair<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.320> some
