00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to see what it might look like if it

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130 
to see what it might look like if it
really<00:00:22.920> were<00:00:23.100> live<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.609> now<00:00:23.789> ok<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
really were live right now ok this is a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
really were live right now ok this is a
recreation<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.460> outside<00:00:26.970> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
recreation of what it's like outside of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.570 
recreation of what it's like outside of
O'Shea's<00:00:27.570> right<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> big<00:00:28.560> day<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
O'Shea's right now for the big day but I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.160 
O'Shea's right now for the big day but I
think<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.910> should<00:00:29.939> replace<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> strange<00:00:30.840> deep

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
think we should replace the strange deep

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170 
think we should replace the strange deep
sea<00:00:31.470> creature<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.340> probably<00:00:32.759> wouldn't<00:00:33.030> be

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
sea creature that probably wouldn't be

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030 
sea creature that probably wouldn't be
there<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.840> ok<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.010> thinking

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
there like that ok you know I'm thinking

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
there like that ok you know I'm thinking
we<00:00:35.430> should<00:00:35.579> probably<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.940> mix<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> whole

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
we should probably just mix the whole

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
we should probably just mix the whole
thing<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.840> instead<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.829> replacing<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
thing you know instead of replacing it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.970 
thing you know instead of replacing it
with<00:00:38.370> something<00:00:38.489> else<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:39.690> bad<00:00:39.899> since<00:00:40.800> we're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
with something else my bad since we're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.590
