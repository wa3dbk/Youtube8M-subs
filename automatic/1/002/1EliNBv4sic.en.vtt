00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:09.630
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.170
 us on hp g6 2286 laptop service 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:20.220
 and we need to disassemble and clean it from 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 dust so let's start at first we remove 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.240
 battery unscrew one bolt on the back 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.240
 back cover 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 remove the cover we got access to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.809
 hard disk ram and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.210
 WIFI modules need to be removed 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.210
 we connect the connector of the hard disk drive 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:11.310
 disconnect the wires and there is this Wi fi 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 unscrew the module itself 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 unscrew the bolts on the perimeter 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.710
 laptop and also inside 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.660
 so here we still have two bolts 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:43.630
 is it a keyboard or brighter 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:46.210
 unscrew the bolts where I saw the writer here 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.680
 By the way, near each Baltic there 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.790
 signature for example baltic wind is m 2 and 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.150
 5 to 4 of 4 that means thickness 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.180
 Baltic must be 2 and 5 millimeters and 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:06.490
 length is 4 millimeters also here 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.590
 written release you have to call it you 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:15.030
 were easily from their seat 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 also here we unscrew the keyboard 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.620
 it is also written you must click to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.730
 keyboard we otschelknul camping 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.730
 from your seat 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.550
 see yes 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.489
 disconnect the keyboard cable 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.440
 here we have another two three inside 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:57.379
 four militants toyz two and five for four 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.420
 it is important not to lure them and then when we 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:04.340
 we will collect 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.980
 all tighten the bolts correctly otherwise 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.819
 you can twist here and not fallen on this 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.900
 damage either the motherboard or 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.530
 panel he just valve there will be visible 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.730
 damage so disconnect the cable and 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.730
 power and touchpad 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:32.120
 in this place we have a connection 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:40.329
 most likely these are dynamics so another 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:43.730
 bolt us here now we need 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.780
 plastic card and I go through and 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.450
 laptop perimeter 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:59.739
 hiding latch and top cover 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:59.739
 should we take off another missed 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.329
 no big effort here if there is 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.680
 missed bolt we won't hurt anything 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.069
 that's the way we removed the top 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.069
 cover 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.560
 here we mean that inside is a connector 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.130
 connecting additional its stars 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.710
 the port 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.620
 power cable here also comes in a cable 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:33.900
 this is wi-fi here we connect 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:38.370
 matrix loop connector and here we still have 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.389
 this is glued together connects 9 to the reiter 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.389
 stronghold wore connect 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.600
 there is still a power connector plugged in 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:02.479
 like this we look beyond us maternal 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.660
 fee it is screwed here you can see here one 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:09.380
 wolves where it should be screwed 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.199
 directly to the body itself and if 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:19.060
 designation arrow triangle 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:21.500
 so little white we try 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.010
 motherboard us rises up 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.870
 look nothing down there is no no here 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.870
 so we removed the motherboard 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.080
 to access the fan itself 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.639
 cooling systems we need to remove itself 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.830
 motherboard cooling system 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:50.360
 then the cooler here we have is such that 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:57.950
 he is shot understands here can be seen in this 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:59.840
 side unscrew the cross here 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.340
 so half unscrewed 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.970
 and then we can go on 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.970
 completely 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.420
 as well as unscrew from video cards 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.070
 disconnect the connector of the cooler itself and 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:43.750
 We try to shoot, he can still be here 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:48.120
 stick it like that and that's it 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:50.980
 effort we removed the cooling system itself 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.770
 so as you can see yes here is thermal grease 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.230
 we dried out if we removed the system 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.230
 cooling must be replaced 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.350
 thermal grease is sold specialized 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:09.900
 stores if you do it yourself 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.900
 must buy this thermal grease 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.800
 So 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:25.660
 unscrew the two small screws 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:28.960
 here are the latches like this 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:33.370
 how to disassemble the cooling system as 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.340
 the rule here is a lot of dust and dust 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:40.980
 such shreds go astray 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.980
 similar to felt boots we call them 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:50.260
 to lubricate the fan itself, he 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.870
 removed like that simple effort up 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.230
 not a bit of sunflower oil 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:59.470
 engine oil or there silicone oil and 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:01.810
 vacuuming we put 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.240
 thermal grease and laptop is going to 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.030
 reverse order thank you for watching 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.410
