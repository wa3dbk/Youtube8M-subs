here and what I'm gonna do is cut them

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.950 
here and what I'm gonna do is cut them
in<00:02:22.530> half<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.910> reason<00:02:24.300> why<00:02:24.450> I'm<00:02:24.600> cleaning

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
in half and the reason why I'm cleaning

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.440 
in half and the reason why I'm cleaning
them<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.170> half<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.730> blowtorch

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
them in half is I'm going to blowtorch

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.380 
them in half is I'm going to blowtorch
them<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.870> second<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.440> tell<00:02:29.070> you

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
them in a second or tell you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.980 
them in a second or tell you
alternatively<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.660> don't<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
alternatively if you don't have a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.900 
alternatively if you don't have a
blowtorch<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> cut<00:02:32.730> them<00:02:32.820> in

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
blowtorch but I'm going to cut them in

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.460 
blowtorch but I'm going to cut them in
half<00:02:33.030> because<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.420> want<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.810> soft<00:02:34.230> gooey

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
half because I want that soft gooey

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.540 
half because I want that soft gooey
Center<00:02:35.040> facing<00:02:35.580> up<00:02:35.870> when<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:36.990> pop<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.590> our

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
Center facing up when we pop it on our

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.280 
Center facing up when we pop it on our
sweet<00:02:39.000> potatoes<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> reason<00:02:40.140> why

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
sweet potatoes because the reason why

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.680 
sweet potatoes because the reason why
I've<00:02:40.590> said<00:02:40.950> face<00:02:41.459> them<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.270> sticky

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
I've said face them up with that sticky

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.110 
I've said face them up with that sticky
side<00:02:42.900> when<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.200> cut<00:02:43.410> through<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.120> because

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
side when we cut through it is because

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.230 
side when we cut through it is because
when<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:45.990> blowtorch<00:02:46.740> them<00:02:46.980> now<00:02:47.160> they're<00:02:47.940> going

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
when I blowtorch them now they're going

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.650 
when I blowtorch them now they're going
to<00:02:48.480> caramelize<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.890> better<00:02:50.190> now<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
to caramelize a lot better now this is

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.180 
to caramelize a lot better now this is
what<00:02:51.810> I'm<00:02:51.900> gonna<00:02:52.050> use<00:02:52.290> one<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.770> these<00:02:52.890> bad<00:02:53.160> boys

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
what I'm gonna use one of these bad boys

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.810 
what I'm gonna use one of these bad boys
blowtorch<00:02:54.380> now<00:02:55.380> if<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> don't<00:02:55.740> have<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:56.730> of

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
blowtorch now if you don't have one of

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.600 
blowtorch now if you don't have one of
those<00:02:57.170> very<00:02:58.170> simply<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:58.980> put<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.280> under

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
those very simply you can put it under

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.910 
those very simply you can put it under
the<00:02:59.730> grill<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.780> five<00:03:01.200> minutes<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.680> high

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the grill for about five minutes on high

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.120 
the grill for about five minutes on high
or<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.330> pop<00:03:03.630> these<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.620> oven<00:03:04.770> for

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
or you can pop these in the oven for

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.500 
or you can pop these in the oven for
about<00:03:06.020> 7<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.050> 10<00:03:07.200> minutes<00:03:07.709> at<00:03:07.920> about<00:03:08.130> 180<00:03:08.700> 350

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
about 7 to 10 minutes at about 180 350

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.479 
about 7 to 10 minutes at about 180 350
Fahrenheit<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.320> you'll<00:03:11.040> get<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> same

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
Fahrenheit and you'll get the same

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:19.910 
Fahrenheit and you'll get the same
result

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.140 

so<00:03:20.790> that's<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.420> how<00:03:21.600> easy<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:23.090> for<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so that's it how easy is that for a

will<00:04:09.269> be<00:04:09.300> used<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.690> these<00:04:09.810> sort<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.140> flavor

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
will be used to these sort of flavor

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.940 
will be used to these sort of flavor
combinations<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.610> just<00:04:11.970> goes<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:12.900> well<00:04:13.110> and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
combinations it just goes so well and

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.860 
combinations it just goes so well and
it's<00:04:14.130> not<00:04:14.280> overly<00:04:14.610> sweet<00:04:14.790> like<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.510> would<00:04:15.780> be
