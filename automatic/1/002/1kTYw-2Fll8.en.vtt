00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.580 
lead climbing if you look up you see
these<00:01:40.939> Clippy<00:01:41.299> things<00:01:41.539> up<00:01:41.719> on<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.990> wall<00:01:42.200> okay

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
these Clippy things up on the wall okay

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.779 
these Clippy things up on the wall okay
now<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.649> difference<00:01:45.889> between<00:01:46.099> top<00:01:46.429> rope<00:01:46.670> and

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
now the difference between top rope and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.699 
now the difference between top rope and
lead<00:01:46.999> is<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.689> when<00:01:47.810> you're<00:01:47.929> leading<00:01:48.109> the

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
lead is that when you're leading the

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.620 
lead is that when you're leading the
Rope<00:01:48.889> is<00:01:49.009> on<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.279> ground<00:01:49.459> okay<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
Rope is on the ground okay as the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.929 
Rope is on the ground okay as the
climber<00:01:50.869> moves<00:01:51.170> up<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.649> belayer<00:01:52.219> feeds<00:01:52.639> the

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
climber moves up the belayer feeds the

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.120 
climber moves up the belayer feeds the
rough<00:01:53.119> out<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:53.810> climber<00:01:54.109> clips<00:01:54.770> into<00:01:54.979> these

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
rough out the climber clips into these

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.819 
rough out the climber clips into these
intermediate<00:01:55.819> anchor<00:01:56.149> points<00:01:56.509> here<00:01:57.259> the

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
intermediate anchor points here the

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.409 
intermediate anchor points here the
cloud<00:01:58.039> for<00:01:58.219> this<00:01:58.399> one<00:01:58.579> they<00:01:58.669> clip<00:01:58.880> in<00:01:59.060> here

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
cloud for this one they clip in here

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.300 
cloud for this one they clip in here
they<00:01:59.779> climb<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.289> here<00:02:00.469> they<00:02:00.590> clip<00:02:00.799> in<00:02:00.979> here

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
they climb to the here they clip in here

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.580 
they climb to the here they clip in here
they<00:02:01.759> climb<00:02:01.969> up<00:02:02.149> here<00:02:02.329> let's<00:02:02.869> say<00:02:03.079> they<00:02:03.229> slip

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
they climb up here let's say they slip

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.980 
they climb up here let's say they slip
now<00:02:04.520> they're<00:02:04.759> going<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:04.969> fall<00:02:05.240> twice<00:02:05.569> as<00:02:05.779> far

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
now they're going to fall twice as far

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.109 
now they're going to fall twice as far
as<00:02:06.139> they<00:02:06.289> are<00:02:06.439> about<00:02:06.590> above<00:02:07.579> this<00:02:07.759> last

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
as they are about above this last

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.300 
as they are about above this last
protection<00:02:08.989> point<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:10.310> last<00:02:10.610> quick<00:02:11.120> draw

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
protection point this last quick draw

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.190 
protection point this last quick draw
now<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.730> force<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> going<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.780> need<00:02:16.020> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
now all that force is going to need to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
now all that force is going to need to
be<00:02:16.350> accounted<00:02:16.800> for<00:02:17.040> by<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.250> Rope<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.030> belayer

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
be accounted for by the Rope the belayer

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.330 
be accounted for by the Rope the belayer
of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.290> harness<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.070> equipment

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
of the harness and the equipment

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.400 
of the harness and the equipment
involved<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.690> order<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.260> got

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
involved so in order to do that you got

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.140 
involved so in order to do that you got
to<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> 12<00:02:22.770> years<00:02:22.950> old<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.850> got<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.090> be

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
to be 12 years old and you got to be

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.790 
to be 12 years old and you got to be
able<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.360> climb<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:24.630> least<00:02:24.750> 259<00:02:25.230> we'll<00:02:25.710> get

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
able to climb at least 259 we'll get

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.790 
able to climb at least 259 we'll get
into<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.130> ratings<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.460> little<00:02:26.640> later
