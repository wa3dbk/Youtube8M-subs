the it's the lead-in to the welcome to
the<00:00:17.480> videogame<00:00:17.990> written<00:00:18.980> by<00:00:19.070> Paul<00:00:19.340> Denis<00:00:19.580> and

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
the videogame written by Paul Denis and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.940 
the videogame written by Paul Denis and
by<00:00:20.960> Carlos<00:00:21.439> stander<00:00:23.350> but<00:00:24.350> I<00:00:24.380> thought<00:00:24.590> I<00:00:24.890> could

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
by Carlos stander but I thought I could

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.620 
by Carlos stander but I thought I could
just<00:00:25.280> read<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:25.910> write<00:00:26.180> something<00:00:26.570> about

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
just read it and write something about

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.689 
just read it and write something about
it<00:00:26.900> but<00:00:27.020> I<00:00:27.050> thought<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.410> would<00:00:27.830> be<00:00:27.980> more<00:00:28.640> useful

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
it but I thought it would be more useful

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.750 
it but I thought it would be more useful
to<00:00:29.150> show<00:00:29.360> you<00:00:29.420> inside<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.260> book<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:31.550> we're

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.180 
to show you inside the book and so we're
gonna<00:00:31.820> have<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.059> little<00:00:32.149> look<00:00:32.390> inside<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.020> book

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
on the back but you can probably pick it

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.489 
on the back but you can probably pick it
up<00:00:40.940> significantly<00:00:41.479> cheaper<00:00:41.659> than<00:00:41.899> that<00:00:41.989> it

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
up significantly cheaper than that it

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:43.899 
up significantly cheaper than that it
was<00:00:42.679> originally<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.550> was<00:00:43.640> released

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
was originally it was released

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.119 
was originally it was released
individually<00:00:44.690> as<00:00:44.809> five<00:00:45.050> separate<00:00:45.469> books<00:00:45.710> and

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
individually as five separate books and

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.739 
individually as five separate books and
they're<00:00:46.519> all<00:00:46.639> available<00:00:46.879> digitally<00:00:47.539> on<00:00:47.659> the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
they're all available digitally on the

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.809 
they're all available digitally on the
iPad<00:00:48.079> on<00:00:48.350> through<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.920> comixology<00:00:49.489> app<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:49.789> I

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:49.819 
iPad on through the comixology app and I

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.619 
iPad on through the comixology app and I
think<00:00:50.030> they're<00:00:50.120> about<00:00:50.300> 150<00:00:51.190> roughly<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.789> let's

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
think they're about 150 roughly so let's

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.450 
think they're about 150 roughly so let's
bring<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.109> camera<00:00:54.350> over<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.829> we'll<00:00:55.129> open<00:00:55.280> up

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
bring the camera over and we'll open up

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.529 
bring the camera over and we'll open up
the<00:00:55.579> book<00:00:55.729> and<00:00:55.760> we'll<00:00:56.059> take<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.299> look<00:00:56.420> what

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
the book and we'll take a look what

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.250 
the book and we'll take a look what
inside<00:01:00.429> okay<00:01:01.429> so<00:01:01.489> as<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:01.789> can<00:01:01.999> see<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.449> looks

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
inside okay so as you can see it looks

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.630 
inside okay so as you can see it looks
very<00:01:03.440> much<00:01:03.620> like<00:01:03.679> the<00:01:03.829> videogame<00:01:04.190> cover<00:01:04.430> this

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640

the<00:01:22.430> story<00:01:22.700> between<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.180> two<00:01:23.300> games<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.350> so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
the story between the two games and so

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.240 
the story between the two games and so
we<00:01:26.960> can<00:01:27.110> we're<00:01:27.200> going<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.380> look<00:01:27.470> at<00:01:27.590> how<00:01:27.950> Arkham

skip<00:04:22.530> through<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.860> end

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.659 

we<00:04:33.600> can<00:04:33.780> see<00:04:33.990> there<00:04:34.230> was<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.250> concept

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
we can see there was like this concept

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.030 
we can see there was like this concept
stuff<00:04:36.450> included<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.380> think<00:04:37.710> originally

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
stuff included so I think originally

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.270 
stuff included so I think originally
this<00:04:38.490> wasn't<00:04:38.790> in<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.840> paper<00:04:40.650> books<00:04:40.950> as<00:04:41.130> they

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
this wasn't in the paper books as they

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.340 
this wasn't in the paper books as they
were<00:04:41.340> released<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:41.970> think<00:04:42.720> this<00:04:42.990> might<00:04:43.200> have

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.390 
were released I think this might have
been<00:04:43.410> available<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.980> was<00:04:44.070> like<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.190> digital
