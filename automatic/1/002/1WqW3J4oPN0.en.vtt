00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
that sound on every tired of it I turn

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.140 
that sound on every tired of it I turn
it<00:02:58.489> up<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:58.580> because<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.850> want<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.000> make<00:02:59.060> sure

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
because when they're floating it's not

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.800

make sure that they're nice and even

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.009 
make sure that they're nice and even
these<00:03:07.940> are<00:03:08.060> already<00:03:08.300> floating<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.810> want

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
these are already floating so you want

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.180 
these are already floating so you want
