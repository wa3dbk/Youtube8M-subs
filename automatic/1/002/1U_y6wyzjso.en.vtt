different<00:00:39.210> about<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.719> phone<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
different about this phone so like I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.860 
different about this phone so like I
said<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.170> person<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:44.579> owns<00:00:44.969> his<00:00:45.180> phone<00:00:45.360> told

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
said the person that owns his phone told

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.299 
said the person that owns his phone told
me<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.110> she<00:00:46.289> dropped<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> friend

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
me that she dropped it or a friend

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.410 
me that she dropped it or a friend
dropped<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.789> whatever<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.180> not<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
dropped it or whatever that's not the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
dropped it or whatever that's not the
case<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.800> point<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.510> guess<00:00:52.199> when<00:00:52.530> she

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
case the point is that I guess when she

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
case the point is that I guess when she
dropped<00:00:53.010> her<00:00:53.129> phone<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.570> theory<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
dropped her phone this is my theory so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
dropped her phone this is my theory so

if you can guys like tell me maybe what

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.490

of way to say this her phone and this is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.590 
of way to say this her phone and this is
this<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:46.110> been<00:01:46.380> such<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.430> big<00:01:47.759> issue<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.270> me<00:01:48.420> her

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this has been such a big issue at me her

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
this has been such a big issue at me her
phone<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.979> backlight<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.820> phone<00:01:51.060> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
phone the backlight of this phone I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
phone the backlight of this phone I
guess<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> probably<00:01:52.799> what's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> problem

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
guess this is probably what's a problem

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.219 
guess this is probably what's a problem
but<00:01:54.619> it's<00:01:55.619> been<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.070> dim<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:58.100> for<00:01:59.100> example

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
but it's been going dim so for example

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
but it's been going dim so for example
ok<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.680> there's<00:02:01.950> an<00:02:02.130> example<00:02:02.579> like

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
ok there you go there's an example like

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.649 
ok there you go there's an example like
see<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> dim<00:02:04.969> you<00:02:05.969> can't<00:02:06.180> even<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.540> the

the<00:02:15.340> screen<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.879> then<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.599> next<00:02:16.930> day<00:02:17.110> it

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
the screen and then the next day it

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.140 
the screen and then the next day it
started<00:02:17.680> doing<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.129> I<00:02:18.310> thought<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:19.000> was<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
started doing it I thought it was a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.720 
started doing it I thought it was a
connection<00:02:19.629> with<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.430> flex

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
connection with the the the flex

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.270 
connection with the the the flex
cables<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.329> for<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.629> LCD<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.379> digitizer

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
cables right for the LCD the digitizer

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.509 
cables right for the LCD the digitizer
and<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:25.599> disconnected<00:02:26.439> up<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.890> made<00:02:27.129> sure<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.340> turn

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
and I disconnected up I made sure I turn

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.530 
and I disconnected up I made sure I turn
off<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.819> phone<00:02:28.000> first

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
off the phone first

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.259 
off the phone first
so<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.680> disconnected<00:02:30.519> I'm<00:02:30.670> turned<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.090> back<00:02:31.209> on

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
so I disconnected I'm turned it back on

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.199 
so I disconnected I'm turned it back on
and<00:02:31.810> then<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.459> disconnected<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.670> cable<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.090> was

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
and then I disconnected this cable I was

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.059 
and then I disconnected this cable I was
right<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.510> -<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.019> then<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.260> reconnected<00:02:35.890> it

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
right here - and then I reconnected it

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.339 
right here - and then I reconnected it
all<00:02:36.730> these<00:02:37.060> right<00:02:37.299> here<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.870> were<00:02:37.959> connected

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
all these right here that were connected

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.089 
all these right here that were connected
to<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.530> motherboard<00:02:38.909> disconnected<00:02:39.909> them

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
to the motherboard disconnected them

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.800 
to the motherboard disconnected them
then<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.129> reconnected<00:02:42.819> um<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> took<00:02:43.510> out<00:02:43.629> the

with the result so I'm stuck here with

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:02.789 
with the result so I'm stuck here with
an<00:02:54.970> iPhone<00:02:55.329> 4<00:02:55.629> that<00:02:56.790> has<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:58.470> dim<00:02:59.470> light<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:01.799> now

an iPhone 4 that has a dim light so now
see<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:04.000> works<00:03:04.269> now<00:03:05.519> this<00:03:06.519> is<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.940> main

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
see it works now this is like the main

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.789 
see it works now this is like the main
problem<00:03:07.389> there<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.900> go<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.019> little<00:03:08.230> turn<00:03:08.620> off

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
problem there you go a little turn off

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.289 
problem there you go a little turn off
randomly<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.670> think<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.000> only<00:03:10.180> solution

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
randomly like I think the only solution

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.000 
randomly like I think the only solution
I<00:03:10.810> found<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.349> is<00:03:11.530> temporary

I found and this is temporary

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.860 
I found and this is temporary

problem<00:03:54.010> with<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.220> dim<00:03:54.400> light<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:56.040> summarise

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
problem with the dim light so summarise

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.720 
problem with the dim light so summarise
it<00:03:57.220> all<00:03:57.340> up

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
it all up

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.460 
it all up
it<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:59.430> flicking<00:04:00.430> back<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.389> off<00:04:01.510> but

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
it is flicking back on and off but

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.050 
it is flicking back on and off but
mostly<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> dim<00:04:03.220> light<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.579> could<00:04:03.699> see<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
mostly a dim light you could see the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.430 
mostly a dim light you could see the
screen<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.690> phone<00:04:04.930> functions<00:04:05.699> it's<00:04:06.699> just<00:04:07.030> as

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
screen the phone functions it's just as

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.610 
screen the phone functions it's just as
you<00:04:08.440> can<00:04:08.560> hear<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:10.000> just<00:04:10.269> it<00:04:10.810> goes<00:04:11.169> on<00:04:11.409> to<00:04:11.590> a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
you can hear it it just it goes on to a

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.069 
you can hear it it just it goes on to a
dim<00:04:11.889> light<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.579> think<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.419> might<00:04:13.720> be<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
dim light and I think it might be the

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.589 
dim light and I think it might be the
back<00:04:14.260> line<00:04:14.530> but<00:04:14.979> I<00:04:15.190> reconnected<00:04:15.879> all<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.180> LCD

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
back line but I reconnected all the LCD

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.390 
back line but I reconnected all the LCD
flex<00:04:17.169> cables<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:19.570> I'm<00:04:20.470> pretty<00:04:20.829> sure<00:04:20.979> it's

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
flex cables I and I'm pretty sure it's

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.830 
flex cables I and I'm pretty sure it's
not<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.789> LCD<00:04:22.300> itself

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
not the LCD itself
