the Maverick you'll be able to use the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.999 
the Maverick you'll be able to use the
sniper<00:01:39.509> version<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> may<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.530> able<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> use

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
sniper version of it may be able to use

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.590 
sniper version of it may be able to use
the<00:01:41.930> regular<00:01:42.930> gun<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.729> i<00:01:44.759> guess<00:01:45.119> assault

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the regular gun like so i guess assault

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.440 
the regular gun like so i guess assault
rifle<00:01:45.810> version<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:47.240> usually<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
rifle version of it and usually a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
rifle version of it and usually a
veteran<00:01:48.899> bots<00:01:49.110> spawn<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> maverick<00:01:50.250> but

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
veteran bots spawn with the maverick but

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.929 
veteran bots spawn with the maverick but
if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.939> take<00:01:51.270> off<00:01:51.740> every<00:01:52.740> single<00:01:53.159> gun<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
if you take off every single gun that a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719 
if you take off every single gun that a
bar<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.689> use<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.290> obviously<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.399> maverick

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
bar can use then obviously the maverick

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
bar can use then obviously the maverick
is<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> only<00:01:57.119> gun<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.930> combat<00:01:58.259> knife<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is the only gun and the combat knife you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.690 
is the only gun and the combat knife you
can<00:01:58.649> use<00:01:58.829> so

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
can use so

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.779 
can use so
you<00:02:01.180> can<00:02:01.329> play<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:01.960> crew<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:02.530> don't

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
you can play it on a crew but I don't

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.490 
you can play it on a crew but I don't
recruit<00:02:03.789> besides<00:02:04.210> if<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.509> my<00:02:04.630> recruiting<00:02:05.200> uses

sniper<00:02:06.000> regular<00:02:07.000> uses<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.329> sniper<00:02:07.659> I<00:02:07.780> think

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
sniper regular uses a sniper I think

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.719 
sniper regular uses a sniper I think
harder<00:02:08.379> and<00:02:08.470> stores<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.890> use<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.129> attachments

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
harder and stores to use the attachments

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.580 
harder and stores to use the attachments
