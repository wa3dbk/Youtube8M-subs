the<00:00:02.730> netbook<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.650> our<00:00:04.650> most<00:00:04.830> popular<00:00:05.190> Mac<00:00:06.230> but

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.100 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but
what<00:00:07.410> we've<00:00:07.620> what<00:00:08.160> we've<00:00:08.220> done<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.110> we've

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
what we've what we've done and we've

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.009 
what we've what we've done and we've
made<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> habit<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.860> doing<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.340> Apple<00:00:11.700> is

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.480 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is
is<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.410> decided<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.030> over

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.420 

the<00:00:19.029> new<00:00:19.180> macbook<00:00:19.660> is<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:19.930> quite<00:00:20.320> remarkable

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.120 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:21.449> achievement<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.800> really

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.780 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:25.119> just<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.200> complete<00:00:26.650> revolution<00:00:27.640> in

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:28.450> way<00:00:28.480> that<00:00:28.720> notebooks<00:00:29.110> are<00:00:29.259> made

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.930 

when<00:00:41.440> traditionally<00:00:42.040> notebooks<00:00:42.520> are<00:00:42.730> made

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
when traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.070 
when traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:43.680> multiple<00:00:44.680> parts<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.600> problem<00:00:46.960> is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.620 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:47.380> you<00:00:47.710> have<00:00:47.980> multiple<00:00:48.430> parts<00:00:49.060> you<00:00:49.240> you<00:00:49.480> add

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.010 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.440> weight<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.270> increase<00:00:52.720> the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.380 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:53.590> for<00:00:53.620> failure<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.400> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.960 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:56.110> breakthrough<00:00:56.410> that<00:00:57.250> we<00:00:57.430> heard<00:00:57.730> with

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.960 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.210> macbook<00:00:58.840> was<00:00:59.830> to<00:01:00.040> replace<00:01:00.280> all<00:01:00.610> of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
with the macbook was to replace all of

with the macbook was to replace all of
those<00:01:01.120> parts<00:01:01.630> with<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.440> one<00:01:02.770> part<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.460> at

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.530 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:04.449> part<00:01:04.720> we<00:01:04.900> caught<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.229> unibody<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
one part we caught the unibody we

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.440 
one part we caught the unibody we
figured<00:01:08.020> out<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.170> way<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.880> being<00:01:09.880> able<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.180> make

stole space from the tracking surface
and<00:05:02.400> we<00:05:02.970> did<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.390> by<00:05:03.600> making<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.140> entire
