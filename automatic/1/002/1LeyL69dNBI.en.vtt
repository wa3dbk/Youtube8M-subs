00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
of innovative new features on it if we

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.630 
of innovative new features on it if we
start<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> front<00:00:22.710> obviously<00:00:22.980> you've<00:00:23.369> got

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
start at the front obviously you've got

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.849 
start at the front obviously you've got
this<00:00:23.789> drop<00:00:24.510> design<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.619> really

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
this drop design so you get a really

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
this drop design so you get a really
good<00:00:26.099> vision<00:00:26.340> down<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> length<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.300> body

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
sits nice and close to your eyes so

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
sits nice and close to your eyes so
you've<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.359> wide<00:00:30.750> field<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.320> vision

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you've got a really wide field of vision

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
you've got a really wide field of vision
I'm<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.000> real<00:00:33.270> technology<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
I'm the real technology is actually in

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.950 
I'm the real technology is actually in
the<00:00:35.250> skirt<00:00:35.579> though<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.540> turn<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the skirt though so if we just turn this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.610 
the skirt though so if we just turn this
round<00:00:37.940> now<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.690> should<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.290> able<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> see

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
round now you should just be able to see

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.090 
round now you should just be able to see
here<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> dimpled<00:00:42.570> section<00:00:43.140> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
here we have a dimpled section just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
here we have a dimpled section just
around<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.460> where<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> cheeks<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.079> at

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
around that where the cheeks it and at

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
around that where the cheeks it and at
the<00:00:46.410> top<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> forehead<00:00:47.070> section<00:00:47.789> here

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the top of the forehead section here

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.319 
the top of the forehead section here
now<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.379> dimpled<00:00:49.920> section<00:00:50.340> allows<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
now that dimpled section allows the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
now that dimpled section allows the
silicon<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.170> even<00:00:52.620> softer<00:00:53.129> than<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
silicon to be even softer than it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
silicon to be even softer than it
normally<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.840> means<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.260> adapts

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
normally is which means it just adapts

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.700 
normally is which means it just adapts
to<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.100> face<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:57.059> better

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
to your face that little bit better

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.290 
to your face that little bit better
meaning<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> chance<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> leak<00:00:59.670> in<00:01:00.030> those

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
meaning the chance of a leak in those

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
meaning the chance of a leak in those
areas<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.109> much<00:01:01.739> reduced<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.809> with<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:04.229> juicer

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
areas is much reduced as with all juicer

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.520 
areas is much reduced as with all juicer
masks<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> double<00:01:06.150> skirt<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
masks it has the the double skirt so you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
masks it has the the double skirt so you
got<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.799> internal<00:01:08.570> connection<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
got this internal connection here and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
got this internal connection here and
the<00:01:10.650> external<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.369> well<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.080> side

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the external one as well on the side

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.060 
the external one as well on the side
here<00:01:14.509> they've<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:15.750> stability<00:01:16.350> ridges<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
here they've put stability ridges and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.910 
here they've put stability ridges and
what<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> mask<00:01:18.840> goes<00:01:19.560> underwater

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
what this is as the mask goes underwater

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
what this is as the mask goes underwater
obviously<00:01:20.640> water<00:01:20.909> pressure<00:01:21.270> pushes<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.869> your

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
obviously water pressure pushes on your

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
obviously water pressure pushes on your
face<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> before<00:01:23.130> you've

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
face a little bit and before you've

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.450 
face a little bit and before you've
equalized<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.210> those<00:01:24.990> ridges<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:26.130> hold

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
equalized it those ridges actually hold

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.660 
equalized it those ridges actually hold
the<00:01:26.700> mask<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.570> perfect<00:01:28.530> shape<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> don't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the mask in perfect shape so you don't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
the mask in perfect shape so you don't
get<00:01:29.759> any<00:01:29.820> distorting<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.930> once

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
get any distorting them all so once

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
get any distorting them all so once
again<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> help<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:33.000> all

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
again this is going to help them all

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.399 
again this is going to help them all
seal<00:01:33.570> much<00:01:34.320> better<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.890> traditional<00:01:35.070> mask

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
seal much better than a traditional mask

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.020 
seal much better than a traditional mask
they've<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.590> put<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> new<00:01:38.070> buckle<00:01:38.490> system<00:01:38.670> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
they've also put a new buckle system on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
they've also put a new buckle system on
here<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.409> has<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:41.040> tilt<00:01:41.549> system<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
here it has this tilt system so that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
here it has this tilt system so that
just<00:01:43.890> allows<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> adjust<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.060> exactly<00:01:45.540> how

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
just allows you to adjust it exactly how

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.179 
just allows you to adjust it exactly how
you<00:01:45.810> want<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:48.079> loosen<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.350> mask<00:01:49.560> you've<00:01:50.070> got

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you want to loosen the mask you've got

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.520 
you want to loosen the mask you've got
these<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.369> tabs<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.540> side<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
these two tabs on the side here and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.080 
these two tabs on the side here and
obviously<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.159> pull<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> mask<00:01:53.790> strap

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
obviously you just pull the mask strap

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
obviously you just pull the mask strap
as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.930> need<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.950> tighten<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.880> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
as you need to to tighten it up you just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.630 
as you need to to tighten it up you just
pull<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.259> hear<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.430> just

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
pull it and you can hear there it's just

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.200 
pull it and you can hear there it's just
the<00:01:59.850> clicking<00:02:00.600> through<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> ratchet<00:02:01.619> system

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
the clicking through the ratchet system

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
the clicking through the ratchet system
it's<00:02:03.210> got<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.390> swivel<00:02:03.899> section<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.710> well

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
