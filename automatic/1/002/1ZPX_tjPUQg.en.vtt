thing so we ended up switching to a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.730 
thing so we ended up switching to a
another<00:01:24.990> store<00:01:25.970> program<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.500> one

instead of having the button at the top

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510 
instead of having the button at the top
right<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.750> will<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> top<00:01:31.619> toolbar<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
right it will be in the top toolbar and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.149 
right it will be in the top toolbar and
it<00:01:32.700> should<00:01:32.939> say<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> says<00:01:33.930> shop<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
a new way it's basically the same just a
different<00:01:46.560> system<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> lot

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
different system but I think it's a lot

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
different system but I think it's a lot
better<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> little<00:01:49.829> bit

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
better and it might just be a little bit

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
better and it might just be a little bit
different<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.520> us<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:50.909> used<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
different for us to get used to but I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.620 
different for us to get used to but I
think<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> lot<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.350> professional<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
think it's a lot more professional and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.359 
think it's a lot more professional and
the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:55.020> problem<00:01:55.200> should<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.710> happen<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the same problem should not happen and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.060 
the same problem should not happen and
another<00:01:57.090> thing<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.960> load<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.890> other

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
another thing is I can load the other

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.100 
another thing is I can load the other
one<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> could<00:01:59.520> only<00:01:59.700> load<00:02:00.090> X<00:02:00.509> amount<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
one I could only load X amount of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.780 
one I could only load X amount of
products<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> would<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.340> wait<00:02:02.490> until

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
products so I would have to wait until

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.959 
products so I would have to wait until
certain<00:02:03.780> things<00:02:04.140> sold<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.890> order<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.729> add

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
certain things sold in order to add

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.249 
certain things sold in order to add
another<00:02:06.180> product<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.399> add

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
another product so this one I can add

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.719 
another product so this one I can add
no<00:02:09.470> up<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:09.860> thousand<00:02:10.310> products<00:02:10.640> or

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
no up to a thousand products or

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.390 
no up to a thousand products or
something<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.420> I'm<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.379> spend<00:02:12.709> quite<00:02:13.370> a
