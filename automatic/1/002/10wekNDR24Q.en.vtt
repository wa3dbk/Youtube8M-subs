00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 both a point 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.799
 welcome another iof more guide 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.690
 legends on this occasion have asked me 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.389
 to make a guide on how to change the 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.360
 audios in game within the game at 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.730
 English on the Latin America server 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.919
 north and it's the same for the customer of the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.739
 Latin America South and used the 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.500
 same configuration but I 'll still go 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.300
 doing it step by step the first thing that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.489
 we have to do is open our 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.950
 client league of legends and have it with 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.440
 all updates according to 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.899
 our region that is latin america a 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.149
 Once this is done we have to update the 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.890
 client with the voices in English with the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.980
 North America region 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.750
 remember that these steps will have to be 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.670
 do every time there is a new 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.710
 champion update since it is 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.649
 modify the voices files you have already 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.589
 updated our client we return to 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.690
 the Latin America region 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.359
 corresponding once this is completed 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.059
 step we will pass to our browser 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.460
 files and we will enter the folder where 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.920
 We have installed our client on 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.439
 league of legends and we will look for the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.540
 voice file in English 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.670
 us which is the corresponding to the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.009
 North America region 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.939

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.350
 will always change the number of 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.770
 existing folders and the names of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.680
 each of them to know what the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.159
 proper should start from the newest 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.640
 the oldest one exploring each of 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.490
 them until you find the data folder and 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 Within this folder there must be the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.300

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.190

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.770
 to take it to another folder 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.099
 now we have to go back to the folder 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.160
 projects and we enter the folder of 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.170
