00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.289 
details using star stencils from
European<00:02:52.239> body<00:02:52.420> art<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:53.470> retrospect<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.730> really

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
European body art in retrospect I really

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.880 
European body art in retrospect I really
think<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:55.989> would<00:02:56.079> have<00:02:56.170> been<00:02:56.290> easier<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.620> to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
think it would have been easier just to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.309 
think it would have been easier just to
draw<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.160> stars<00:02:57.549> free-handed<00:02:58.390> because<00:02:59.140> these

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
draw the stars free-handed because these

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.869 
draw the stars free-handed because these
stencils<00:02:59.709> are<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.250> designed<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.579> be<00:03:00.670> used

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
stencils are really designed to be used

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.330 
stencils are really designed to be used
with<00:03:00.940> airbrush<00:03:01.299> makeup<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.310> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
with airbrush makeup and it's kind of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.550 
with airbrush makeup and it's kind of
difficult<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.970> get<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.269> little<00:03:04.569> eyeliner

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
difficult to get the little eyeliner

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.050 
difficult to get the little eyeliner
brush<00:03:05.890> tip<00:03:06.099> in<00:03:06.250> there<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.700> get<00:03:06.849> it<00:03:06.970> to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
brush tip in there and get it to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.960 
brush tip in there and get it to
transfer<00:03:07.480> into<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> star<00:03:08.109> shape<00:03:08.349> so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
transfer into the star shape so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.330 
transfer into the star shape so
definitely<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.209> freehand<00:03:10.720> these<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.859> then

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
definitely just freehand these and then

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.490 
definitely just freehand these and then
as<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.359> see<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.540> added<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.959> few<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.379> dots

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
as you can see I added a few little dots

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.050 
as you can see I added a few little dots
between<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.160> stars<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.849> kind<00:03:16.030> of

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
between the stars just to kind of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.240 
between the stars just to kind of
complete<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.390> look<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.870> add<00:03:17.019> some<00:03:17.319> faraway

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
complete the look and add some faraway

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.280
