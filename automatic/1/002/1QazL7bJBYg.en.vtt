00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
we're gonna be rescuing skippers crew

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:32.410 
we're gonna be rescuing skippers crew
and<00:00:23.600> also<00:00:24.600> getting<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> super<00:00:25.470> treasure<00:00:25.680> room

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.900 

so<00:00:33.420> once<00:00:33.780> you're<00:00:33.899> down<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.550> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> try<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
so once you're down here if you try to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
so once you're down here if you try to
come<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.420> earlier<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.140> could<00:00:37.290> see

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
come down here earlier you could see

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950 
come down here earlier you could see
that<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> pathway<00:00:38.190> was<00:00:38.370> blocked<00:00:38.780> by<00:00:39.780> these

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that the pathway was blocked by these

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.740 
that the pathway was blocked by these
Pistons<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> you've<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
Pistons but now that you've got the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.549 
Pistons but now that you've got the
engines<00:00:43.079> running<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.180> get<00:00:45.329> through<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
engines running you can get through so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.020 
engines running you can get through so
just<00:00:46.590> kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.039> time<00:00:47.250> these<00:00:47.430> rights<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
just kind of time these rights so that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
just kind of time these rights so that
you<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.539> crushed

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.440 

and<00:00:56.710> you'll<00:00:57.100> see<00:00:57.250> this<00:00:57.400> little<00:00:57.670> branch<00:00:58.150> to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
and you'll see this little branch to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.020 
and you'll see this little branch to
whip<00:00:59.130> now<00:01:00.130> eventually<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.670> want<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.910> go

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
whip now eventually you want to go

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.540 
whip now eventually you want to go
straight<00:01:01.270> across<00:01:01.450> but<00:01:01.960> first<00:01:02.340> you'll<00:01:03.340> want<00:01:03.430> to

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
straight across but first you'll want to

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.650 
straight across but first you'll want to
whip<00:01:04.180> up<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.720> upper<00:01:05.590> level<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:07.540> got

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
whip up to that upper level if you got

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.500 
whip up to that upper level if you got
the<00:01:07.780> dungeon<00:01:08.140> map<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.530> can<00:01:08.680> see<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:10.300> there

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
the dungeon map you can see that there

on heading through and you're gonna come
to<00:02:35.420> another<00:02:35.630> branch<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.890> live<00:02:37.069> on

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
to another branch that you can live on

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.180 
to another branch that you can live on
now<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.690> time<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.110> need<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.290> land<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.680> top<00:02:39.950> of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
now this time you need to land on top of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.860 
now this time you need to land on top of
the<00:02:40.280> Pistons<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.820> can<00:02:41.000> set<00:02:41.269> up<00:02:41.360> going<00:02:41.600> under

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
the Pistons you can set up going under

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.009 
the Pistons you can set up going under
it<00:02:42.019> so<00:02:42.470> get<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> good<00:02:42.830> swing<00:02:43.300> plan<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.450> top<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.870> it

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
it so get a good swing plan on top of it

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.040 
it so get a good swing plan on top of it
and<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:45.560> when<00:02:45.680> it's<00:02:45.830> at<00:02:45.980> its<00:02:46.010> full<00:02:46.340> peak<00:02:47.050> jump

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
and then when it's at its full peak jump

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.199 
and then when it's at its full peak jump
down<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.470> second<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:50.950> then<00:02:52.209> you

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
down to the second one and then you

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.210 
down to the second one and then you
could<00:02:53.330> pull<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.540> switch<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.380> that<00:02:54.769> opens<00:02:55.100> up

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
could pull that switch and that opens up

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.810 
could pull that switch and that opens up
the<00:02:56.290> shortcut<00:02:57.290> back<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.739> where<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:58.100> were<00:02:58.130> but
