00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.210
 putting on the shoes the other is putting 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 in place of the other is to perceive the situation 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.460
 from the point of view of the other see 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:23.519
 what the other see and hear what the other 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.830
 felt what the other feels when 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.519
 the difficulty of communication 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.079
 we tend to ignore the point 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.649
 of the other and not hear the other 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:42.270
 not see what the other sees does not perceive the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 that the other feels worse than that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.050
 we require others to notice the same 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.739
 the way we perceive it and when we do not 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:59.039
 we got this we label the other one of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.699
 resistant of stubborn people 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.320
 more experienced tell us 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.420
 put yourself in the other's place 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.860
 but how do you do it for you to wear 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.290
 shoes of the other 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.159
 You need to take off your shoes first. 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:24.530
 it seems obvious it is not but it is not always 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.119
 easy because for this you need to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.560
 willingness to leave 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:37.200
 temporarily their point of view their 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.159
 certainties your opinions your feelings 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.210
 beliefs and even their values 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:51.829
 This makes it invulnerable to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 the other's shoes is sometimes scary 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:02:00.000
 relationship difficulties are 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.329
 are almost always less afraid of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.229
 look ridiculous afraid of being seen as 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.800
 weak fear of being ill treated 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.960
 criticized for being ignored fear of being 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.100
 rejected 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.920
 and when you put on the other's shoes 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.110
 you will have access to these feelings 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.110
 these - putting on the other 's shoes is a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.560
 act of courage but a good technique 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.940
 always helps make things so much more 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.840
 easy because it's really worth it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:44.580
 understand how the other person perceives the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.930
 that the other feels so you will speak to 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.290
 the other language other you will 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.440
 communicate much better life becomes more 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.820
 easy lighter more fluid competence 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.820
