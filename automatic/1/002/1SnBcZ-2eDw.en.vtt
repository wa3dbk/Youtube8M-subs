00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.930 
going from here I'm not going to use a
lot<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.440> tension<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.399> want<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
lot of tension because I want it to be

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.430 
lot of tension because I want it to be
really<00:01:36.300> soft<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.869> romantic

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
really soft and romantic

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.980 
really soft and romantic
it's<00:01:38.430> basically<00:01:38.850> dividing<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> hair<00:01:39.690> in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it's basically dividing the hair in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.249 
it's basically dividing the hair in
three<00:01:40.820> taking<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.270> section<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
three taking my right section up and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
three taking my right section up and
over<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> middle<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.399> left<00:01:44.700> section<00:01:44.970> up

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
over into the middle my left section up

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880 
over into the middle my left section up
and<00:01:45.420> over<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> middle<00:01:46.080> now<00:01:46.319> I'm<00:01:46.709> going<00:01:46.830> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and over to the middle now I'm going to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.490 
and over to the middle now I'm going to
start<00:01:47.100> incorporated<00:01:47.869> corporative<00:01:48.869> hair<00:01:49.110> into

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
start incorporated corporative hair into

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.779

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
it as I work down to the nape of the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:04.520 
it as I work down to the nape of the
neck

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.500
