00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.719
 so come in addition to being so mediocre 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.540
 only fun with a blackberry q5 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.700
 we now have here the possibility times 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.470
 to watch the apps for games 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.289
 you can download for a fee 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.160
 For free you have some apps like 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.730
 you can see 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.230
 there is then the best selling apps and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.020
 further I go moved up here on the left 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.020
 we play it to see that there is such a thing 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.970
 so we have about this for 89 cents 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:54.820
 active soccer 179 free actual 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:58.690
 star wars after all rose partly so became 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.589
 about a fake then you see 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.420
 have something like a game 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.670
 Well you will not have so much fun 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.540
 I would say so or something 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.560
 you think 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.289
 the top actor pay a fee 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.710
 Patrol was good too 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.950
 Well, an old hat that does not convince 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.549
 you can see for yourself if we like that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.340
 things like six whole or the trigger 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.140
 have played on android devices for 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.329
 someone who likes to play between 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.600
 it is never a choice always 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.399
 here is for example what in any case 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.399
 also not convinced 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:58.850
 but no human for ninja h 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.510
 how is that going to be this 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.510
 cut 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.619
 good that a capacitive touchscreen 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.770
 but feels like a resistive 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.110
 cut or me actually just only 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 three youths where three side by side me 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.739
 I do not see anything 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.440
 Let's take a look at the music player 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.680
 It's better that we have up- to-date music music 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.600
 then we all have library 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.280
 So here's the current music library 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 Hardly anybody else presented here 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.110
 listing okay too blackberry bold 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.050
 All reproductions so albums yo 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.920
 It was like the box I could now 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.920
 just do not appreciate it 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.260
 there is the box and by the way 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.159
 comeback in the first part of the video not 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.159
 mentioned 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.550
 notification bar 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.329
 sometimes from even though the music running 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.650
 we have notifications here 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.060
 time of day can alarm is turn on their 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.939
 a cool feature I now have much 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.519
 to change 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:50.590
 that's the lockscreen high vision then 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.719
 are you at the player but just because here 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.849
 high certain so you can not come 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.249
 access the music if we 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.870
 whole times 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.250
 and so much more besides 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.019
 I'm sorry about multimedia features 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.840
 it's not that much nfc tags you can do 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.000
 can read music videos cut 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.370
 or just music videos cut videos 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.349
 as you have taken here that here it 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:18.030
 We have your pictures gallery then times 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:20.440
 just a last picture that looks like this 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.849
 and so much multimedia functions 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.560
 would have you after a short 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.560
