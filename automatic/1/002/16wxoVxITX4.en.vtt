dialogue in shades of grey and it's a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.350 
dialogue in shades of grey and it's a
really<00:03:16.170> good<00:03:16.260> example<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.950> using<00:03:17.280> design<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
really good example of using design to

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.630

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
give even more meaning to the story and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.310 
give even more meaning to the story and
then<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.970> text<00:03:21.300> continues<00:03:21.600> are<00:03:21.989> right<00:03:22.170> up

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
then the text continues are right up

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.500 
then the text continues are right up
until<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.860> back<00:03:23.070> end<00:03:23.370> paper<00:03:23.730> which<00:03:24.120> has<00:03:24.300> a

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.180 
until the back end paper which has a
page<00:03:24.750> number<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.680> might<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.070> only

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
page number and it might be the only

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.760 
page number and it might be the only
time<00:03:26.520> I've<00:03:26.790> seen<00:03:26.820> an<00:03:27.270> end<00:03:27.510> paper<00:03:27.810> get<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.470> page

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
time I've seen an end paper get a page

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.830 
time I've seen an end paper get a page
number<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.610> since<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> ending<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.600> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
number but since the ending is so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.680 
number but since the ending is so
intense<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.680> love<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> book<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.880> ends

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
intense I love that the book just ends

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.630 
intense I love that the book just ends
and<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:33.989> aren't<00:03:34.230> even<00:03:34.440> any<00:03:34.620> blank<00:03:34.950> pages<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
and there aren't even any blank pages to

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.160 
and there aren't even any blank pages to
buffer<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.060> between<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.570> end<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> story

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
buffer you between the end of the story

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.840 
buffer you between the end of the story
and<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.650> end<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.040> book<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.640> looks<00:03:38.820> like

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
and the end of the book so it looks like

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.120 
and the end of the book so it looks like
