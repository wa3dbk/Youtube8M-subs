00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.459
 ni 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:16.349
 If you are nice to meet you, it is a long time no see 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.349
 My name is katsudon p 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:26.940
 This time, we will introduce additional programs of computer craft 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.099
 I have put the mining turtle in the bonus chest 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:37.020
 We will introduce additional programs using this mining turtle 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:42.040
 To explain a little for those who do not know computer craft 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 It is a mod that will make the robot in the shape of a turtle variously 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.990
 Then we will introduce the program soon 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:57.240
 The first introduction program is the stairs program 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:01.070
 Over and put a torch and fuel in the lower right corner of the mining Turtle slot 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.070
 If you enter sty tomorrow ok 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:13.180
 When the spelling did not know is you can see the list by typing programs 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.180
 Another system only at the input is annoying people hard whopping s 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.390
 Turtle started digging the stairs 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.370
 I have set up Matsuaki properly 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.420
 2 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:36.110
 If you leave it to the turtle, you will dig into the bedrock as it is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.110
 me 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.890
 Oops I have run into a valley 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.100
 Even in such a case, it is safe as the turtle moves while setting up the scaffold properly 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 pr 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 Directly below the end carved to bedrock 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.750
 The rest is just broken down and recovered Tsuruhashi can be broken down quickly 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.800
 The following introduction is the fabric program 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:21.350
 First , install the turtle in front of the left side of the area you want to level 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.350
 Te' put fuel and torches in the same way as earlier 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:31.810
 Enter the depth and width of the area you want to level after leveling 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:37.180
 Please leave a space between leveling and numbers . 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.690
 If you put some cobblestone blocks, you will build a foothold on the water 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.550
 In the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.270
 Let's observe the leveling work of the turtle 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.270
 2 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.520
 I am 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.740
 Four days 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.740
 2 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.740
 voodoo 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.140
 2 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140
 Hmm 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.349
 Yes The fabric is complete without any problem 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.170
 The following introduction is the tofu building program 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:39.740
 Place the turtle on the left hand in front of the place where you want tofu to build as you did before 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.200
 And also put the fuel and torches in the same way as earlier 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.200
 We will also prepare other materials 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.600
 I think that I want to build with wood this time 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:03.549
 In addition, let's use a raw wood for the pillar part of four corners 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.549
 All you have to do is tofu and enter 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.840
 Let's observe the construction work of the turtle 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.650
 Completed tofu is excellent 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.139
 Turtle Let recovered break Bukkake than we came down under 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:48.460
 The following program is a ladder installation program 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:52.569
 Now place the ladder in the middle two slots of the lower row 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:57.179
 Fuel is still the bottom right slot 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.179
 Then enter the ladder and execute 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.340
 We came back to set up a ladder to dig to bedrock 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:35.440
 An improved version is also available for this program 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.810
 Put the fuel and ladder in the same way as before 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.810
 Also put a block such as cobbles 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:51.620
 And the program name is finally in the ladder 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:51.620
 In spaced is only with and space and run the Add city 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:02.319
 What do you mean by this time we are setting up while climbing up 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.810
 The place where there is no block is said to put a ladder while installing the block put earlier 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:08.670
 I will 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:15.060
 It looks good when you make or head when they become lost in the underground 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:19.640
 By the way, I will dig in the direction I did without attaching the last one, and the hole will be lost 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.640
 It is for people who want to jump off 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:29.690
 The last thing to introduce is the tunnel program 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.230
 Second from the left in addition to fuel and torches 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:36.270
 I put a chest 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:39.740
 And after tunnel to enter the length and height of the tunnel 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.740
 Why cherry blossoms 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:50.669
 This is an improved version of the existing program called tunnel 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:55.900
 Height designation function torch installation function 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:07:00.380
 The feature to automatically put in the chest when the item is full is added 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:05.000
 How was the additional program introduction above ? 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:10.850
 Masu mining one Turtle of cost diamond ferric 7 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.530
 Pretty good feeling Once you've dug by a plurality of Turtle in Akaishi per immigration and to the make in about 1 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:17.170
 Can be mined 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.170
 Please use by all means if it is good 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.220
 In Dewa is 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.830
 2x 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.640
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.640
 Yeah yeah yeah
