00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:09.190
 Claudia, my dear sister, I have already 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.650
 week in healthy acre and salt and very lively 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.389
 but prepared for the worst 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.879
 the men and women who have given me 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.949
 here shelter also I have been warned of 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.619
 that the road to more is already taken by 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.860
 mercenaries and bandits that are not these 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.949
 land I dare not venture what 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.759
 that means when I started from roma 'ago 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.750
 ten months 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.940
 I did it with a single faithful 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.400
 and find out what he could not do our 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 father in a letter written to a year 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.090
 before I was born I mentioned a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.790
 library hidden under the stones 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.350
 of the castle too a sanctuary 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.350
 full of inestimable wisdom 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.730
 what will I find when I get here 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.370
 who will receive me 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.140
 a host of impatient Templars 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.510
 as I fear 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.760
 or nothing but the rise of a cold and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.129
 lonely wind 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.370
 more has not harbored the murderers 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.350
 for almost 300 years 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.220
 we can continue claiming how 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 our 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.490
 we are welcome friends 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 I'm sick of this struggle in the unit 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.890
 not because we are tired but because our 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.100
 conflict seems to advance in a single 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.729
 address 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.790
 they made chaos today I have more questions than 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.790
 answers 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.320
 that's why I've come so far 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.810
 in search of clarity in search of the 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.759
 wisdom that left the great altar 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.590
 to better understand the purpose of 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.299
 our fight 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.299
 and my place in it 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.650
 if something happened to me, Claudia, if 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.140
 my ability or my ambition will fail me 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.840
 gone astray 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.420
 do not look for revenge or retaliation in my 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.060
 name but struggle to continue the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 search for the truth so that all 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.340
 can benefit 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.830
 my story is only one of thousands 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.340
 the world will not suffer because they end up 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.340
 prematurely 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.880
 ah
