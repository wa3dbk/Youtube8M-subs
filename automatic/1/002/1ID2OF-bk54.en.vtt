00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 friends all welcome i'm in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.310
 discus store the one we have in 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 Chernogorsk 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.950
 and today we will review the novelty 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.219
 new from ffi paradise is a new 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.830
 sphere lamp in 158 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 but in this case we just have a version 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.230
 without letter prefix manufacturer 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.109
 states on the lantern 860 lumens on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.930
 supplied batteries it will 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.510
 work with us for 25 hours 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:41.370
 luminance brightness general all information on 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 a box of boxes I found guarantees 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.140
 not some kind of certificate that the lantern 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.140
 was tested on this date 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.340
 respectively warranty terms 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.440
 User's Manual 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.950
 there with all specifications, etc. and 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.650
 etc. 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.940
 I will not watch the charger 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.940
 means two batteries 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:25.850
 but further under this near the shooting gallery I find 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.250
 the unit itself which we have is 42 volts and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.940
 a drain of 1 and 2 amps is enough 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.410
 powerful charger 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.820
 and now the lantern itself 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.670
 but take that little lantern off 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.180
 increased means the diameter of the reflector 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.990
 the diode is actually the same as in 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.640
 previous versions xml 2 version is without 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.430
 in letter prefix 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.960
 that is, it is simple and it means that 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.180
 lantern has 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.750
 cold shade of light in mode and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.690
 turn on 360 magnetic ring 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 degrees that one that the other way 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.860
 has about three modes well and plus 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.550
 stupid mode there sos or 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.550
 strobe light 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.989
 this time the lantern was equipped with such 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.150
 here's a removable clip and also can not 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.159
 say what it is well, where it is possible 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 it will be convenient to hook on the belt and there on 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.470
 shirt pocket there was something or something 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.640
 something like this can be for some string 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.569
 backpack because this lantern think 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:56.970
 it will be possible to cover it not only under 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:58.769
 water inside we also see reliable 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.389
 battery hold design 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.260
 compartment 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:09.540
 This is an exceptional U-shaped thread. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.190
 which is well anodized made also 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.340
 two oring that protects against leakage 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 I will remind that in the set of spare origings 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.280
 no, here we see thick walls 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.430
 means the flashlight itself and we have stored 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.090
 batteries and further in depth 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.209
 to the most for 4 lecturers we see that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.579
 battery can be set as with 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.359
 flattened plus contact and 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.030
 just with contact with a point there means 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.359
 There is no mechanical protection against 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.359
 polarity reversal 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:53.129
 the lantern is made with high quality and soundly 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.669
 the best traditions of the series but still gray 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:04.199
 we are fighting for quality 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:08.930
 fights for a good market so durable 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.930
 the anode as well as in all previous versions 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.459
 but as for this 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:18.709
 screw cap which holds 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.340
 we have batteries well batteries 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.210
 then there are no complaints either 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.000
 the only thing that seemed to me not 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.569
 handy this lanyard see what it means in 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.110
 cover 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.410
 these holes are well angry and 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.410
 rare 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.520
 which will exclude quick rubbing about 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.440
 the sharp edges of the hole here this lanyard 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.289
 if compared with previous versions 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.870
 lanterns then it is in my opinion what that 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.020
 less convenient in the sense that he 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.380
 then pulled ie it can be 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.520
 somehow pull up and fix ie 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.840
 You see such a specific button 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.330
 mean in this version 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.120
 you're no reason there just some 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.120
 plastic so to plastic slider 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.889
 Battery included go to 2600 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.889
 Milliamper battery new enough 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.900
 But if you compare means with the first 150 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.110
 version then see how in diameter 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.510
 the reflector actually increased 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.090
 only think difference is possible 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.790
 what are the differences in the drivers then 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.970
 Eating means glow 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.310
 lantern because here stated 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.280
 On lumen us more than in previous in 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.180
 holes and this means that with such 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.840
 butt with the same power with such 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.090
 same diode 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.620
 but the brightness is temporary 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.290
 accordingly, there were some improvements 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.060
 apparently in the driver but we will not know 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.780
 because we stand still from nowhere 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.450
 we can give the lanterns exactly the same 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.100
 here is the central spot exactly 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.669
 same diameter if shine on 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.100
 the same distance both lanterns but 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:16.010
 It means it is a soft side flare. 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:19.600
 larger diameter this lantern illuminates 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.560
 selection of large spaces in diameter and 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.940
 so you won't need extra 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.940
 turn your head around 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.240
 maybe so extensive 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.150
 means wide cheese wide flare 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.310
 will give and some kind of negative 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.610
 the effects of muddy water but it will need 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.630
 find out in a practical way the lantern in 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.849
 the price does not vary much with the first 150 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.510
 model so if you allow 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:53.030
 means I recommend this lantern 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.810
 shopping well, that's all up to new 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.849
 reviews 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.849
 Thank you all for your attention so far.
