haven't already I'd suggest taking a
look<00:00:06.870> at<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.080> first<00:00:07.410> project<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.220> series

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
look at the first project in this series

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.490 
look at the first project in this series
by<00:00:08.849> clicking<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.360> link<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> video<00:00:09.929> or<00:00:10.380> in

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the description but to quickly summarize

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.419 
the description but to quickly summarize
I<00:00:12.780> believe<00:00:13.410> there<00:00:13.650> are<00:00:13.679> great<00:00:14.160> many

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I believe there are great many

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.609 
I believe there are great many
possibilities<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.389> teaching<00:00:16.109> moments<00:00:16.529> in

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
possibilities for teaching moments in

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.890 
possibilities for teaching moments in
MLPs<00:00:17.130> future<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.240> riders<00:00:18.600> were<00:00:18.750> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
MLPs future if the riders were to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
MLPs future if the riders were to
introduce<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.590> long<00:00:19.859> term<00:00:20.250> relationship

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
introduce a long term relationship

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.640 
introduce a long term relationship
between<00:00:21.119> certain<00:00:21.600> characters<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> show

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
between certain characters in the show

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.340 
between certain characters in the show
and<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.789> course<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> potential<00:00:25.170> for

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and of course there is the potential for

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.009 
and of course there is the potential for
a<00:00:25.410> great<00:00:25.710> many<00:00:25.890> flaws<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.730> well<00:00:26.970> I've<00:00:27.660> already

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
a great many flaws as well I've already

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
a great many flaws as well I've already
gone<00:00:28.199> over<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.920> possibility<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
gone over the first possibility of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
gone over the first possibility of
putting<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.330> focus<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.170> already

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
putting more focus on an already

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
putting more focus on an already
established<00:00:32.059> relationship<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.210> previous

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
established relationship in my previous

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.290 
established relationship in my previous
video<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.070> I'd<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> continue<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
video so now I'd like to continue the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
video so now I'd like to continue the
discussion<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.870> two<00:00:37.290> more<00:00:37.590> possibilities

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
discussion with two more possibilities

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.940 
discussion with two more possibilities
take<00:00:39.149> two<00:00:39.510> established<00:00:40.140> characters<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
take two established characters that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.680 
take two established characters that
haven't<00:00:41.370> shown<00:00:41.550> any<00:00:41.850> interest<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> each<00:00:42.510> other

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
haven't shown any interest in each other

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
haven't shown any interest in each other
before<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> create<00:00:43.920> stories<00:00:44.520> where<00:00:44.730> they

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
before and create stories where they

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.600 
before and create stories where they
begin<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> take<00:00:45.510> notice<00:00:45.680> or<00:00:46.680> introduce<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

brand<00:00:47.910> new<00:00:48.180> character<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.930> slowly<00:00:49.289> work<00:00:49.649> in

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
brand new character and slowly work in

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
brand new character and slowly work in
story<00:00:50.250> elements<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> relationship<00:00:51.600> can

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
story elements where a relationship can

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.770 
story elements where a relationship can
grow<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.520> already<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:54.239> than<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> few

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
grow so there's already more than a few

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.709 
grow so there's already more than a few
female<00:00:55.350> characters<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.280> established

given his unpredictable nature I can see

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
given his unpredictable nature I can see
a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> story<00:01:29.040> possibilities<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> could

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a lot of story possibilities that could

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
a lot of story possibilities that could
teach<00:01:30.720> some<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.320> essential<00:01:31.920> life<00:01:32.130> lessons

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
well I would think that the writers

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
well I would think that the writers
would<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> show<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.399> is

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
would first have to show that there is
more<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> his<00:02:00.149> character<00:02:00.600> than<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.140> vanity

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
in order for that to work

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
in order for that to work
fancy-pants<00:02:04.610> there<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:05.969> potential<00:02:06.420> here

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

well<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.260> for<00:05:04.710> one<00:05:04.740> believe<00:05:04.889> that<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.550> writers

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
well I for one believe that the writers

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.180 
well I for one believe that the writers
do<00:05:06.270> have<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.840> potential<00:05:07.289> as<00:05:07.680> they<00:05:08.070> have

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
do have that potential as they have

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.670 
do have that potential as they have

managed to exceed our expectations many
times<00:05:11.039> before<00:05:11.310> they've<00:05:12.120> presented<00:05:12.720> some

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
times before they've presented some

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.500 
times before they've presented some
excellent<00:05:13.500> stories<00:05:14.160> relatable<00:05:14.970> characters

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
excellent stories relatable characters

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.110 
excellent stories relatable characters
and<00:05:15.690> memorable<00:05:16.380> morals<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.520> be<00:05:17.639> honest<00:05:18.000> I

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
and memorable morals to be honest I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.060 
and memorable morals to be honest I
think<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.630> biggest<00:05:18.930> hurdle<00:05:19.500> for<00:05:19.530> them<00:05:19.800> isn't

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
think the biggest hurdle for them isn't

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.730 
think the biggest hurdle for them isn't
so<00:05:20.430> much<00:05:20.490> in<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:20.820> execution<00:05:21.690> but<00:05:22.020> rather<00:05:22.289> how

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
so much in the execution but rather how

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.800 
so much in the execution but rather how
the<00:05:22.800> audience<00:05:23.340> would<00:05:23.610> handle<00:05:24.090> such<00:05:24.330> a<00:05:24.360> change

the audience would handle such a change
it<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:26.039> rather<00:05:26.400> easy<00:05:26.789> to<00:05:27.090> see<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.570> there<00:05:27.780> are

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
it is rather easy to see that there are

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.529 
it is rather easy to see that there are
a<00:05:28.050> lot<00:05:28.530> of<00:05:28.710> people<00:05:29.100> who<00:05:29.430> believe<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.850> certain

a lot of people who believe that certain

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.390 
a lot of people who believe that certain
