teaspoons of oil so it's just a lot like
making<00:01:15.930> cookies<00:01:16.080> although<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> guess<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
making cookies although I guess you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.840

add<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.329> our<00:01:57.360> solids<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.799> pour<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.159> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
add it to our solids and pour this in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
add it to our solids and pour this in
here<00:01:59.810> doesn't<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.960> smell<00:02:01.110> great<00:02:02.000> yeah

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
here doesn't that smell great yeah

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.770 
here doesn't that smell great yeah
and<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:05.250> we're<00:02:05.430> gonna<00:02:05.549> mix<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.180> mix<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.540> mix

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and now we're gonna mix and mix and mix

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.600 
and now we're gonna mix and mix and mix
until<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:08.399> turns<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.690> dough<00:02:10.430> make<00:02:11.430> sure

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
until it turns into a dough make sure

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
until it turns into a dough make sure
that<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.000> stir<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> spoon<00:02:13.110> at<00:02:13.410> first

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that you stir it with a spoon at first

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.750 
that you stir it with a spoon at first
because<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.950> don't<00:02:14.100> want<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.459> food

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
because you don't want that food

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.670 
because you don't want that food
coloring<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:15.300> hands<00:02:15.750> right<00:02:16.110> away<00:02:16.140> until

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
coloring on your hands right away until

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.590 
coloring on your hands right away until
it<00:02:16.770> gets<00:02:16.920> absorbed<00:02:17.310> into<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.940> solids<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
it gets absorbed into the solids and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.630 
it gets absorbed into the solids and
then<00:02:19.230> once<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.590> starts<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.890> get<00:02:20.040> absorbed<00:02:20.310> you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
then once it starts to get absorbed you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.250 
then once it starts to get absorbed you
can<00:02:20.819> knead<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.300> with<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.450> hands<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.230> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
can knead it with your hands just like a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.340 
can knead it with your hands just like a
regular<00:02:22.440> dough<00:02:24.170> doesn't<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.290> smell<00:02:25.380> great

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
regular dough doesn't this smell great

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.130 
regular dough doesn't this smell great
all<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.250> we've<00:02:29.430> got<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.819> into<00:02:30.180> a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
all right and so we've got it into a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.190 
all right and so we've got it into a
pretty<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.950> crumbly<00:02:32.610> mix<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.480> most<00:02:33.959> of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
pretty good crumbly mix now and most of

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440 
pretty good crumbly mix now and most of
them<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.709> liquid<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.160> then<00:02:35.310> absorbed<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:36.330> now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
them the liquid is then absorbed so now

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.210 
them the liquid is then absorbed so now
we<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.750> stick<00:02:36.989> our<00:02:37.019> hands<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.470> here<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.860> start

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
we can stick our hands in here and start

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.910 
we can stick our hands in here and start
to<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.930> smoosh<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:39.959> together<00:02:40.170> into<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> ball

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
to really smoosh it together into a ball

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.060 
to really smoosh it together into a ball
and<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.810> guys<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> take<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> turn<00:02:43.890> at

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
and if you guys want to take a turn at

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.340 
and if you guys want to take a turn at
kneading<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.820> together<00:02:45.090> half<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.140> fun<00:02:46.320> of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
kneading that together half the fun of

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.140 
kneading that together half the fun of
this<00:02:46.530> experiment<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.280> smooshing<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> all

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this experiment is smooshing it all

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.240 
this experiment is smooshing it all
together<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.290> great<00:02:49.560> way<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> teach

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250
