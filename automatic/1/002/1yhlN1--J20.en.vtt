you kind of see on the side if you want
to<00:03:01.510> be<00:03:01.630> really<00:03:01.959> strict<00:03:02.200> about<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.680> could

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
to be really strict about it you could

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.620 
to be really strict about it you could
kind<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.130> fold<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.579> over<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.150> create<00:03:04.600> a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
kind of fold this over and create a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.660 
kind of fold this over and create a
little<00:03:04.780> pinch<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.829> that<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.040> know<00:03:06.160> how<00:03:06.310> far<00:03:06.549> to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
little pinch so that you know how far to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.550 
little pinch so that you know how far to
fold<00:03:06.880> over<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.049> just<00:03:08.200> eyeball<00:03:08.350> it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
fold over or you can just eyeball it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.559 
fold over or you can just eyeball it
it's<00:03:08.889> not<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.250> serious<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.150> we're<00:03:10.540> just

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
it's not that serious so we're just

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.360 
it's not that serious so we're just
gonna<00:03:10.750> kind<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.079> fold<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> over<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:12.220> that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
gonna kind of fold it over here to that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.300 
gonna kind of fold it over here to that
point<00:03:12.670> keeping<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.989> edge<00:03:14.380> lined<00:03:14.980> up<00:03:15.130> with

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
point keeping that edge lined up with

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.870 
point keeping that edge lined up with
the<00:03:15.430> center<00:03:15.670> line<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.060> we've<00:03:16.150> got<00:03:16.359> going

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the center line that we've got going

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.520 
the center line that we've got going
then<00:03:18.880> I'm<00:03:19.060> gonna<00:03:19.150> take<00:03:19.420> everything<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.109> fold

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
then I'm gonna take everything and fold

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.589 
then I'm gonna take everything and fold
it<00:03:20.739> back<00:03:20.950> out<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.639> essentially<00:03:22.180> I'm<00:03:22.389> going<00:03:22.540> to

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
it back out and essentially I'm going to

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.750 
it back out and essentially I'm going to
fold<00:03:22.840> about<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> third<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.950> way<00:03:24.099> so<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.609> can

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
fold about a third of the way so you can

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.400 
fold about a third of the way so you can
kind<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.030> guess<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.569> see<00:03:25.870> if<00:03:26.109> you're<00:03:26.260> doing

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
kind of guess and see if you're doing

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.559 
kind of guess and see if you're doing
this<00:03:26.620> about<00:03:26.769> right<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.310> imagine<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.419> the

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
this about right and imagine that the

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.780 
this about right and imagine that the
part<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.989> folded<00:03:29.500> over<00:03:30.040> should<00:03:30.549> be<00:03:30.639> about

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
part you folded over should be about

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.120 
part you folded over should be about
equal<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.180> what<00:03:31.510> remains<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.859> I'll<00:03:32.919> kind<00:03:33.040> of

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
equal to what remains so I'll kind of

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.400 
equal to what remains so I'll kind of
get<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.400> part<00:03:33.669> folded<00:03:34.030> over<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:38.200> I'm<00:03:38.319> gonna

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
get that part folded over then I'm gonna

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.199 
get that part folded over then I'm gonna
fold<00:03:38.769> everything<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.340> half<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.150> be

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
fold everything in half and that can be

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.400 
fold everything in half and that can be
a<00:03:40.239> little<00:03:40.389> tricky<00:03:40.690> because<00:03:40.750> there's<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.079> lot<00:03:41.380> of

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
a little tricky because there's a lot of

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.129 
a little tricky because there's a lot of
paper<00:03:41.709> here<00:03:42.220> with<00:03:42.579> this<00:03:43.060> beak<00:03:43.569> area<00:03:44.019> that

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
paper here with this beak area that

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.409 
paper here with this beak area that
we're<00:03:44.230> working<00:03:44.349> with<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.829> bench<00:03:45.040> especially

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
we're working with this bench especially

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.460 
we're working with this bench especially
just<00:03:46.419> take<00:03:46.630> care<00:03:46.810> not<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.989> kind<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.290> make<00:03:47.440> it

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
just take care not to kind of make it

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.879 
just take care not to kind of make it
too<00:03:47.769> weird<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:49.840> going<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.049> take<00:03:50.319> the

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
too weird and then I'm going to take the

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.469 
too weird and then I'm going to take the
head<00:03:51.099> part<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.579> if<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.759> just<00:03:51.910> kind<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.180> pinch

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
head part and if you just kind of pinch

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.479 
head part and if you just kind of pinch
on<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.690> whole<00:03:52.840> thing<00:03:53.049> and<00:03:53.229> pop<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> out<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:54.340> can

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
on the whole thing and pop it out we can

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.420 
on the whole thing and pop it out we can
then<00:03:54.669> pull

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
then pull

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.949 
then pull
think<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.760> guys<00:03:56.909> can't<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.329> here<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.659> pull

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
think you guys can't see here if I pull

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.470 
think you guys can't see here if I pull
this<00:03:58.110> up<00:03:58.349> then<00:03:59.159> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.430> extend<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.180> to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
this up then you can extend it out to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.330 
this up then you can extend it out to
create<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.989> head<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.379> we<00:04:01.860> want<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.099> just<00:04:02.220> kind

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
create the head and we want to just kind

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.250 
create the head and we want to just kind
of<00:04:02.430> do<00:04:02.610> this<00:04:02.730> straight<00:04:03.629> up<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.049> we<00:04:04.110> get<00:04:04.200> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
of do this straight up so that we get a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.399 
of do this straight up so that we get a
nice<00:04:04.470> right<00:04:04.829> angle<00:04:04.860> right<00:04:05.310> back<00:04:05.549> here<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:07.140> find

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
nice right angle right back here so find

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.800 
nice right angle right back here so find
that<00:04:07.500> nice<00:04:07.920> point<00:04:08.340> there<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.939> smush<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.599> out

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
that nice point there and smush it out

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.080 
that nice point there and smush it out
we're<00:04:12.810> going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.019> make<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.379> head<00:04:13.909> extend<00:04:14.909> out

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
we're going to make the head extend out

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.640 
we're going to make the head extend out
to<00:04:15.120> create<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.569> nicer<00:04:15.930> little<00:04:16.079> beak<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.500> that

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
to create a nicer little beak in that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.620 
to create a nicer little beak in that
part<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:16.979> can<00:04:17.130> kind<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.370> choose<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:18.509> know

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
part you can kind of choose you know

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.479 
part you can kind of choose you know
what<00:04:18.989> angle<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.470> want<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:19.889> once<00:04:20.070> we<00:04:20.190> find<00:04:20.400> a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
what angle you want but once we find a

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.439 
what angle you want but once we find a
good<00:04:20.609> angle<00:04:20.759> for<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:21.120> we're<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.329> gonna

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
good angle for that we're just gonna

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.980 
good angle for that we're just gonna
smoosh<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.780> down<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.300> we<00:04:24.449> have<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.660> nice

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
smoosh it down so that we have a nice

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.010 
smoosh it down so that we have a nice
kind<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.530> body<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.949> our<00:04:26.310> Swan<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:27.750> I'm<00:04:27.870> going

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
kind of body of our Swan now I'm going

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.590 
kind of body of our Swan now I'm going
to<00:04:28.080> make<00:04:28.169> this<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.440> stand<00:04:28.949> by<00:04:29.220> taking<00:04:29.729> the<00:04:30.030> point

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
to make this a stand by taking the point

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.629 
to make this a stand by taking the point
that<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.870> see<00:04:31.050> down<00:04:31.229> here<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:31.800> folding<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.460> up

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
that you see down here and folding it up

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.469 
that you see down here and folding it up
so<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.210> kind<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.539> create<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:35.180> flat<00:04:36.180> angle

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
so that I kind of create a flat angle

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.640 
so that I kind of create a flat angle
here<00:04:37.400> with<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:39.000> creased<00:04:39.930> edge<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.530> I've

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
here with the creased edge that I've

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.189 
here with the creased edge that I've
made<00:04:40.919> here<00:04:40.979> and<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:41.910> side<00:04:42.180> kind<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.870> creating

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
made here and this side kind of creating

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.930 
made here and this side kind of creating
a<00:04:43.289> right<00:04:43.500> angle<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.669> know<00:04:44.789> it's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
a right angle so that you know it's

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.000 
a right angle so that you know it's
gonna<00:04:45.060> stand<00:04:45.479> up<00:04:45.780> straight<00:04:46.110> don't<00:04:46.800> do<00:04:46.889> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
gonna stand up straight don't do the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.029 
gonna stand up straight don't do the
same<00:04:47.220> thing<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.639> side<00:04:47.849> too<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:49.139> those

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
same thing on this side too and those

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.620 
same thing on this side too and those
little<00:04:50.340> flaps<00:04:50.789> that<00:04:51.060> I've<00:04:51.150> just<00:04:51.300> made<00:04:51.479> are

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.839 
centimetres tall so about half the size
of<00:05:34.050> your<00:05:34.169> paper<00:05:34.380> like<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:38.130> when<00:05:38.280> it's<00:05:38.430> nice<00:05:38.639> and

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
beak we're looking at about nine

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.870 
beak we're looking at about nine
centimeters<00:05:47.630> wide<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.870> guess<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.260> would<00:05:49.470> say

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
centimeters wide I guess it would say

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.899 
centimeters wide I guess it would say
and<00:05:51.440> that<00:05:52.440> kind<00:05:52.620> of<00:05:52.680> gives<00:05:52.830> you<00:05:52.949> an<00:05:53.070> idea<00:05:53.190> of

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
and that kind of gives you an idea of

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.450 
and that kind of gives you an idea of
the<00:05:54.120> space<00:05:54.240> that<00:05:54.389> you've<00:05:54.780> got<00:05:54.990> for<00:05:55.919> our<00:05:56.190> little
