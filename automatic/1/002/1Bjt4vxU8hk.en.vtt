00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
exterior so we can go and I'm and it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.869 
exterior so we can go and I'm and it's
from<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> early<00:00:37.290> third<00:00:37.590> century<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.610> pre

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
from the early third century so it's pre

from the early third century so it's pre
Constantinian<00:00:39.809> which<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.379> important<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Constantinian which is very important to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
Constantinian which is very important to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and it in it since it's in that it's a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
and it in it since it's in that it's a
modern-day<00:00:46.590> Syria<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.180> the

notice<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.829> Judaism<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
notice that in Judaism as we see a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.260 
notice that in Judaism as we see a
mikvah<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> mikvah<00:01:38.270> configurated

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
in a very similar way which shows the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.389 
in a very similar way which shows the
parallel<00:01:42.210> between<00:01:42.450> early<00:01:43.380> christianity<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
parallel between early christianity and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.149 
parallel between early christianity and
synagogue<00:01:44.880> practices<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.829> you'll

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
synagogue practices as you as you'll

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
notice there it's it's very set up very

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
notice there it's it's very set up very
similar<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:50.970> time<00:01:51.270> period

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
similar and of in the same time period

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
similar and of in the same time period
to<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> how<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.860> christians<00:01:53.399> were

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549

to how the how the christians were
baptizing<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.950> have

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
baptizing and then and then here we have

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
baptizing and then and then here we have
another<00:01:56.340> example<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.299> from<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
another example this was from a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.520 
another example this was from a
byzantine<00:01:59.090> era<00:02:00.090> church<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.320> was<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
byzantine era church and this was a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.709 
byzantine era church and this was a
Baptistery<00:02:02.219> were<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> shape<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.479> cross

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
Baptistery were in the shape of a cross

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.950 
Baptistery were in the shape of a cross
you<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.670> some<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> same<00:02:06.509> methods

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you also see some of the same methods

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.479 
you also see some of the same methods
recurring<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.590> judaism<00:02:08.129> where<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.340> have

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
recurring in judaism where you have

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.290 
recurring in judaism where you have
stairs<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.119> step<00:02:09.330> into<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> water

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
stairs that step into the water

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.570 
stairs that step into the water
to<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.690> lower<00:02:10.960> level<00:02:11.080> or<00:02:11.770> people<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.310> immerse

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to a lower level or people can immerse

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.580 
to a lower level or people can immerse
because<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.060> Judaism<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.870> course<00:02:14.560> they<00:02:15.490> also

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
because in Judaism of course they also

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.470 
because in Judaism of course they also
immerse<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.800> their<00:02:17.950> last<00:02:18.190> act<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.820> conversion

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
immerse as their last act of conversion

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.090 
immerse as their last act of conversion
and<00:02:20.050> when<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.130> go<00:02:21.310> back<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.270> cross<00:02:23.100> symbolizes

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
and when we go back the cross symbolizes

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.400 
and when we go back the cross symbolizes
what<00:02:24.580> what<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:25.000> read<00:02:25.240> about<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.750> Romans<00:02:25.900> 6:1

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
what what we read about in Romans 6:1

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.280 
what what we read about in Romans 6:1
through<00:02:26.740> six<00:02:27.070> about<00:02:27.820> being<00:02:28.120> about<00:02:29.050> being

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
through six about being about being

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.930 
through six about being about being
transformed<00:02:29.890> into<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.280> death<00:02:30.460> burial<00:02:30.820> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
transformed into the death burial and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.370 
transformed into the death burial and
resurrection<00:02:31.030> through<00:02:31.780> baptism<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:35.170> also

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
resurrection through baptism so we also

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.050 
resurrection through baptism so we also
and<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.920> other<00:02:36.070> thing<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.370> would<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:36.850> be

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
and the other thing that would really be

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.750 
and the other thing that would really be
different<00:02:37.360> than<00:02:38.110> how<00:02:38.410> we<00:02:38.470> were<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.860> worship<00:02:39.580> is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
different than how we were I worship is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.170 
different than how we were I worship is
how<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:40.780> as<00:02:41.050> how<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:42.130> how<00:02:42.550> they<00:02:42.730> studied

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
how they as how they is how they studied

of them in ancient history said 12 which
is<00:03:22.120> rather<00:03:22.480> significant<00:03:23.380> when<00:03:23.500> Heath<00:03:23.620> when

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
is rather significant when Heath when

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.110 
is rather significant when Heath when
you<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.190> about<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.580> there<00:03:24.760> were<00:03:24.850> 12

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120

apostles and 12 tribes of Israel
so<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.560> other<00:03:29.680> thing<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.310> other<00:03:30.340> thing<00:03:30.520> you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
so the other thing the other thing you

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.430 
so the other thing the other thing you
would<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.690> they<00:03:31.930> would<00:03:32.050> have<00:03:32.200> two

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
would see is that they would have two

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.229 
would see is that they would have two
communions<00:03:32.950> wanted<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.400> be<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.580> family<00:03:34.000> meal
