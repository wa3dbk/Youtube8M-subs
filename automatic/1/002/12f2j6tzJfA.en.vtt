00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 friends hello swami zheka and this 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.099
 life channel today's video 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.370
 will show from two video cards 1 from the company 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.490
 nvidia model jacks 742 company md 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.929
 model r7 250 found out what are these cards 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 capable of taking into account very small 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.490
 the cost of both cards from the company asus and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 there are two gigabytes of video memory 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
 Well, let's go to review the video card 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.789
 provided channel partner shop these 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.410
 Patent a huge selection of computer and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.840
 home appliance link to shop in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.820
 describing a three-second retreat i'm not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.950
 dying comparing these cards to each other I 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.840
 it is only shown that they are capable and large 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 please if after watching the video he 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.890
 it will be useful for you to put Like 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.309
 thank you and go both cards from the company 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.350
 asus 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.969
 Packages are almost identical on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.800
 boxes available information available 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.620
 other GB of video memory in each card 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.420
 by the way r7 250 refers to the mustache line 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.190
 the reverse side of the packaging contains 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 information about the appearance of video cards 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 connectivity availability 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 quality element base and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.460
 used cooling and availability 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.350
 software gpu tweak 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.510
 An-2 I will not do in fact he is a Baxik 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.799
 nothing complete each card has a disk 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.970
 with drivers and software 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.740
 gpu tweak 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 it is in fact a similar mass of the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.390
 the girl also has the instruction general everything and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 very small external map view 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.470
 similar not only packaging but also to their 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.820
 appearance now in the hands of jacks 740 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.619
 aluminum radiator cover up 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 plastic casing among them which 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.040
 reverse fan installed 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.619
 boards nothing remarkable chips 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.540
 memory is decoupled from the back of 4 chips 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.400
 located near the radiator and four more 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.470
 fan power is in contact with it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.930
 2pi new understand what's yours 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.060
 speech adjustment is not in r7 hands now 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.950
 250 card is made on red 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.990
 PCB plastic casing and itself 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.090
 cooling in appearance is no different on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 4 chips are soldered to the back of the board 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.439
 memory and unsoldered and they are unusual 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.149
 way rather the location of two more 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.220
 chip is to collect countries in the lead 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.979
 radiator and two more in contact with it 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.939
 considering very low power consumption 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.950
 no extra power needed on 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.990
 both video cards connect interface 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.170
 there is a tax on the cards 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.020
 VJ digital hdmi and givi and size 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.500
 fan 80 millimeters length gt 740 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.410
 16 centimeters length r7 250 15 half 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.570
 centimeters 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.560
 I will not go much into technical 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.840
 characteristics they are in front of you on the screen 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.330
 as said before the video memory in 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.310
 both graphics cards 2 gb gddr3 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.600
 list of test bench components in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.870
 the description of the video will only say that 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.330
 i7 3770 processor to a frequency of 4 thousand 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.460
 500 megahertz to start, took measurements in 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.020
 benchmarks tested also overclocking 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.670
 parse parameter and maximum 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.740
 show the temperature at the end of this video 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.180
 highland beach mark 4.0 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.010
 ultra settings and maximum 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.060
 red smoothing 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:44.260
 This is r7 250 green gt 740 as a result of r7 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.290
 250 scored 166 trains and 188 poets in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.020
 Accelerating live and 740 is gaining 142 trains and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.670
 154 overclocking 3d mark fire strike 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.600
 I did not change the quality settings 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:00.310
 standard r7 250 gains 1525 points 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.770
 and in the 1754 gt 740 will accelerate gaining 1599 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.320
 points and 1780 overclocking 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.090
 Total testing spent 12 games 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.660
 I propose to evaluate some of them alive 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.660
 comparison 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.520
 without food and water will extend similar 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.960
 look 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.960
 And three nakata Madonna 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:31.879
 what do you see the latest weapon from 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.879
 mass is the largest army in the blink 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.959
 testing broke into two parts first 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.760
 games that went to full hd resolution 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.040
 all games tested minimum 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.599
 settings with anti-aliasing enabled 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.489
 move and and the glow is anisotropic 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.079
 the filter is turned on since the games are large 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.909
 the amount of the result I broke into three 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.859
 the graphics in this graphic is displayed 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.629
 average fps for all games at 2 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:04:00.569
 graphics card as I said red 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:02.430
 strip is r7 250 green jacks 740 on 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.180
 This graph shows the average fps in 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.549
 Overclocking on the last chart is the minimum 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.260
 fps on both video cards i remind that 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.189
 Graphics available for download at 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.650
 description of video 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.609
 unfortunately in three more games comfortable 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.320
 play full or die 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.729
 Well, I got permission 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.900
 reduce to 720p 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.900
 i.e. hd resolution 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.030
 This graph shows the average FPS 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.979
 on games that did not go to full hd 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.599
 resolution is only about 720p 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.639
 I remind that anti-aliasing is disabled 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.259
 minimum settings and all effects 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.669
 included 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.800
 I wanted to comment on the assistant creed 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.419
 unity test I conducted for 15 minutes 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.069
 running along the ground that is on the cover and 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.439
 did not climb at all because there fps 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.560
 going higher let's go over graphics with average 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:57.779
 fps overclocking and minimal graphics 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.610
 fps remind that all graphics are available 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.219
 for download description under this video 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.050
 as promised the beginning of the video will show the parameters 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.599
 overclocking and maximum fixed 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.659
 temperature on the Jetta 740 maximum 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.000
 the temperature did not exceed 56 degrees 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.279
 I managed to overclock 740 by 60 megahertz 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.189
 180 megahertz memory core 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:20.460
 at r7 250 maximum temperature 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:22.800
 was 54 degrees r7 250 popeps 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.770
 managed to overclock on the same 60 megahertz 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.069
 video memory frequency of 200 megahertz 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.319
 noise level load r7 250 gt 740 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.029
 is on the same level but jacks 740 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.620
 published some nasty syst 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.620
 perhaps it did not get such a copy 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.639
 Well, here they are even on 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.979
 budget video cards to play games 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.050
 yes but not ultra but only low 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.149
 don't wait some games go a 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.740
 only in 720p but meanwhile not to play 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:51.360
 you can if you are not willing to spend money 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.789
 or you simply do not have them 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.469
 the gaming card is quite suitable and 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.479
 such options, but they themselves as always were 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.930
 Zheka and mowers channel know more and 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.930
 be me
