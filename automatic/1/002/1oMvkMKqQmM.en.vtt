00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
duck centres of Britain isn't it well I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.939 
duck centres of Britain isn't it well I
wouldn't<00:01:01.289> say<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> great

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
wouldn't say it was one of the great

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.380

duck<00:01:02.250> centres<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> Britain<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.120> like

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
duck centres of Britain but like

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
duck centres of Britain but like
everywhere<00:01:03.809> else<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.229> look<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> think

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
everywhere else we look we like to think

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.030 
everywhere else we look we like to think
that<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.200> river<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that what we do on the river here are a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
that what we do on the river here are a
little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.700> conservation<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
little bit for conservation that's that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.640 
little bit for conservation that's that
we're<00:01:09.780> trying<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> improve<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.619> situation
