00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.760
 we bring another tutorial because the 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.590
 parkour was going to be basically what 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.059
 I just did what presents read in 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.370
 Spanish videos Sancho 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.130
 will present this leap in English 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.740
 English is called rock &amp; bone in Spanish 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.140
 literally translated would be jump 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.850
 rocket does not have much logic but good 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.560
 it is a variant of the payment or malley or 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.300
 is that everyone calls you your way 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.830
 then it is already fucked but the jump 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.050
 basic in 7 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.350
 the typical of all life to go from 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.750
 side then if you do not know how to do it 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.670
 this tutorial and in that way you learn to 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.340
 do it and I'll come to the variant 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.040
 hug it really does not have much 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.559
 mystery is just doing that leap 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.809
 basic but doing what you call that 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.730
 look better and more extended ie 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.190
 that are seen more then then 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.410
 what you have to do basically is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.300
 so that you are going to upload the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.480
 legs try to extend more besides 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 besides that it is much more colorful of 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.750
 that way you can earn a small 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.979
 clear impulse that if you push towards 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.960
 in front of instead of upwards you go to 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.250
 gain much more inertia then 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800
 basically 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.650
 the jump is when you arrive as to 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.200
 make a normal lazy 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.330
 what you are going to do is raise your knees 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.830
 a little to the chest and it's not going to be 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.730
 fully in this but take a little 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.880
 body backwards basically 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.680
 when you go from here you support your hand and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.800
 you raise your legs enough you arrive 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.130
 you go up and down instead of doing as 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.080
 you would do it in a normal way just like that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.120
 going over the wall to climb 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.480
 legs more up 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.150
 and in that way then it simply remains 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.120
 extend was because it is to make the jump 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 but extending towards educational the 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.970
 jump because everyone calls her 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.560
 way I repeat is 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.000
 too many forms of this jump and a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.940
 once you have passed zero by climbing the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.800
 legs here simply extend more 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.360
 cool more and in that way is more 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.360
 colorful and such then I will make one 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.390
 and it would be that way basically 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.890
 then I will do a couple more so what 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.620
 You see, you have any doubt what has been 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.569
 commented but it's not very difficult 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.209
 Really 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.870
 and well you can get into fluency in what 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.870
 that we feel like 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.410
 it's not very complex 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.590
 this is all 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.060
 the erotic so much in English I hope that you 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.460
 I liked that you serve that you learn 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.960
 it's not very complex really but 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.600
 that you have a good base of 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.430
 next jump is very easy is 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.890
 he simply wants to take more risks and 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.300
 went up more then I hope you could 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.300
 learn and this is all 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.870
 6 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.939
 two 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.200
 in descriptions 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.570
 6 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.020
 before 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.730
 law rack 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 Y 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.140

 audio disc 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:16.600
 I'm going to comment that hotmail where

 so let's leave in the description 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:37.119
