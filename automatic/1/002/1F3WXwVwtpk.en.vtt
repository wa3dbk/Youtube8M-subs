buttons sometimes when you use the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.380

buttons to play a song it skips right in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
buttons to play a song it skips right in
the<00:01:21.570> middle<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> song<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> makes<00:01:23.189> songs

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the middle of a song and it makes songs

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.660 
the middle of a song and it makes songs
choppy<00:01:24.500> I've<00:01:25.500> tried<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.220> other<00:01:26.400> wires

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
choppy I've tried it with my other wires

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
choppy I've tried it with my other wires
and<00:01:26.970> these<00:01:27.270> wires<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> only<00:01:28.110> ones<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and these wires are the only ones that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.060 
and these wires are the only ones that
have<00:01:28.829> been<00:01:28.860> doing<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> problem

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
have been doing that so that's a problem

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.560 
have been doing that so that's a problem
there's<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.220> unnoticeable<00:01:32.970> problems<00:01:33.360> like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
there's some unnoticeable problems like

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
there's some unnoticeable problems like
this<00:01:34.350> black<00:01:35.040> smudge<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.090> probably<00:01:36.390> my

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this black smudge but that's probably my

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.440 
this black smudge but that's probably my
fault<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.799> master<00:01:38.130> logo<00:01:38.520> came<00:01:38.970> off<00:01:39.150> right

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
fault and the master logo came off right

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
fault and the master logo came off right
over<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> those<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> problems<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
over here so those are the problems of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.289 
over here so those are the problems of
the<00:01:42.150> wires<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:44.340> part<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> headphone<00:01:45.149> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the wires this part of the headphone is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.630 
the wires this part of the headphone is
still<00:01:45.570> loose<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.799> gotten<00:01:47.369> used<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
still loose but I have gotten used to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
still loose but I have gotten used to
the<00:01:47.850> headbands<00:01:48.600> randomly<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.530> down<00:01:49.799> my

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the headbands randomly going down my

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.090 
the headbands randomly going down my
head<00:01:51.079> when<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> first<00:01:52.409> saw<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:52.950> like

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
head when I first saw this I was like

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.789 
head when I first saw this I was like
yep<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.420> definitely<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.170> into<00:01:55.409> after

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
yep this is definitely going into after

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.580 
yep this is definitely going into after
six<00:01:56.040> months<00:01:56.250> video<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.750> serve<00:01:57.990> over<00:01:58.350> here

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
six months video that he serve over here

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
six months video that he serve over here
is<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:59.520> sticky<00:01:59.969> anymore
