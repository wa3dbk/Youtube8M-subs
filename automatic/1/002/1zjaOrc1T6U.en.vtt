00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.920
 hello greetings and welcome to this new 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.650
 techno drop on which we are going to focus 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.199
 in icloud, which is the cloud service 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.940
 of apple in this official video of the 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.920
 own apple we can see how 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.600
 effectively this service of 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.360
 icloud will serve us to synchronize 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.930
 the different contents that we go 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.970
 downloading good music movies 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.680
 podcast any content is going to 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.750
 serve to synchronize with the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.960
 different devices ios too 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.579
 marked sx where we'll also see good 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.320
 examples of how we can start a 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.810
 project in pages in keynote without following 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.000
 in the different devices this is 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.890
 something very interesting certainly no 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.050
 However, we are not going to focus on this 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.970
 keyboard drop in this but we're going 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.950
 to focus on a subject that is the copies 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.559
 security backups in the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.040
 cloud is no longer necessary to go through the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.170
 computer by itunes but we have the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.850
 cloud to help us do these 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.969
 backups this is very 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.500
 important because basically at the time 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.149
 that something could happen to us 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.280
 device like for example we were 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.900
 can break you can miss us 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.700
 they can steal it 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.190
 what this implies is a copy of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.380
 security is that the device is 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.330
 restores in the new one that we acquire in 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 these cases is restored just like 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.550
 was the previous one included funds from 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.620
 screen without all the configurations 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.520
 folders all files within 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.040
 each application 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.630
 the settings the photos absolutely everything 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.660
 although it also depends logically on what 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.520
 that we want to put in the settings is very 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.100
 interesting we are going therefore to give to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.620
 settings button here we see on the ipad 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.240
 we go to the icloud icon and here in the 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.060
 icloud icon we will see all the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.970
 adjustments as they are put in or not in 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.640
 off and in this case then photos notes to 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.229
 paris all the elements and here we see 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.780
 also storage in access 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.910
 total are here in this case it is quite 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.440
 broad but good also depends on what 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.910
 that we have contracted are 5 gigs 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.369
 free then we can give 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110
 let's say we can change the planning of the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.100
 storage to make this copy of 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.040
 security as we have said 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.800
 above it is what makes the system 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.780
 go directly to the apple cloud and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.920
 make us a dump of the whole situation 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.510
 how it was 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.310
 the device can also be made 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.349
 as we can see here on the iphone has 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.810
 the same options we go to adjustments to 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.870
 icloud here we see all the tabs 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.480
 how are they put on and in this way 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.870
 when we do the backup 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.060
 we will be able to restore it in any case 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.860
 always from the cloud when we have 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 some problem of these for example a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.890
 case study is this is something that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.930
 people a lot of people who have these 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.239
 devices or do not use it either or not 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.610
 Sometimes a practical example does not know it 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.830
 is for example we are in the second a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.140
 trip and the phone is breaking 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.810
 or they steal it we need it or the ipad 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.180
 to work or to do any 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.940
 management we go to a store we take another 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.110
 device and just having wifi makes 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.480
 lack that we have our computer 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.400
 for a local copy only with the wifi and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.590
 we got off the cloud as it was 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360
 a photocopy of how our 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.610
 device before it happened to us 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.170
 that mishap is something very interesting that 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.209
 I wanted to highlight in aesthetics the drop 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.290
 so I hope you liked it and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.290
 until the next technoagro
