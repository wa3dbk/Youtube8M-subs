00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
sometimes you can't get it off and you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.920 
sometimes you can't get it off and you
like<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.700> use<00:01:25.820> like<00:01:26.000> something<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.570> knife

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
thin so sometimes it can be easy

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.450 
thin so sometimes it can be easy
sometimes<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.000> can<00:01:35.150> be<00:01:35.180> really<00:01:35.299> hard

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
millimeter pencil that's too big but if

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.910 
millimeter pencil that's too big but if
you<00:01:45.710> do<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.960> enough<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.259> can<00:01:48.470> get<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.770> band

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
you do it enough you can get the band

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.340 
you do it enough you can get the band
off<00:01:49.189> pretty<00:01:49.990> takes<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.110> little<00:01:51.320> bit<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:53.170> can<00:01:54.170> be

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
off pretty takes a little bit but can be

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.200
