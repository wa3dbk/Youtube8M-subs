00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.220
 What is pareidolia is a stimulus that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 we have in the brain that makes 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.560
 us when seeing an image 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.170
 automatically recognize or shape 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.300
 a preconceived idea usually a 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.200
 image of a face or some 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.050
 figure that we have let's say in our 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.050
 environment for example images that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.910
 they seem to form figures of beings 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.120
 strangers as you can see in these 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.869
 images figures of antiquity that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.810
 they give us a training that could 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.540
 look like current objects do not 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.940
 means that there is no mystery of 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.970
 these pictures some of them if 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.340
 are we think twice are 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.050
 important and you have to analyze the two 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 three times but many of them 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.440
 is it so 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.500
 conformed because our brain 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.110
 it also makes us play like this even 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.930
 our brain has a capacity 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.200
 important visual but our brain 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.430
 has reduced it with the science that is what 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.250
 What do I mean by this, for example? 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.530
 when we are in a very dark place 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.390
 that we can only see the figures in 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 actually we are not seeing in any 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.090
 kind of color but our brain 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.789
 it makes us understand 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.829
 create the color that's why so many 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.009
 times when we are in 99 dark 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.229
 we believe that we take the red shirt 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.929
 turn on the light and it turns out that it was the left 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.479
 green or yellow in our brain 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.569
 we play many situations that many 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.599
 sometimes they make us believe that there 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.400
 some mystery we have to also 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.420
 discard 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.780
 this kind of trick that makes us the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 brain and try to be as objective 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.530
 possible that's why also the day of 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.930
 Today I bring you this topic to be a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.650
 little more to more objective mystics and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.780
 Of course it is now totally true that there is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.829
 many things that have been photographer tom 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.739
 grafiadas and that are really 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.019
 mysterious and they are totally 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.200
 impressive and unknown so 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.359
 simply with the figures in the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.420
 photographs in the talk shows 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.420
 of these issues for ever in their games 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.170
 and be as objective as possible but 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.450
 also another side you have to be open to 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.830
 these topics to understand the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.709
 web and analyze them in a way let's say 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.480
 the most profit possible thanks cross 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.250
 and be your comments 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.020
 I tell them despite the fact that in the past 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.330
 months we have had a month 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.910
 several thousand comments in the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.640
 videos we try to see all of 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.670
 answer them even to subscribe 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.500
 when we see that they are constantly 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.600
 making comments and they are interesting 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.630
 we subscribe to and discuss the catalog 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.400
 still further but let's go soon 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.400
 we are talking and thank you
