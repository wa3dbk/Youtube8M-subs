00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi everyone how about in today's video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.259
 I'm going to show you my wardrobe 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 I will try to share with you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.330
 Well, the things that I do to have it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 so the computers will teach well 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.430
 I think I have it organized 9 a way 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.590
 quite practical and I think we also 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.279
 I could serve and set aside as I have already done 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.960
 cleaning clothes that he did not use and 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.349
 I have also made the change of clothes 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.119
 winter to summer I wanted to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 share it with you I leave you with the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.920
 video that I already made to get rid of the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 clothes then well so we do not use and do 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.390
 place in the closet that good I made a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 diagram and it's pretty if it costs you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 has the clothes going to go well so 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.600
 I leave here the good link as you see 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.739
 the structure of my wardrobe is the basic 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.210
 of ikea la pax which are three modules two 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.739
 wider on the sides and one more 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 narrow of the medium for me to come 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.309
 well with the wall size I had 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.710
 I decided to leave him without a door since I 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.840
 like the lockers so open but if 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.160
 you had doors or if you had a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.050
 smaller closet you can also 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.670
 adapt the things that 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.140
 I have done so that they also serve us 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 for you there are several ways to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.270
 organize the clothes I like in the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.880
 bar hang only parts above 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.010
 to make it look more uniform 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
 all because if you hang pants and 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.720
 skirts the end you see everything as more 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.400
 unbalanced is not visually and what 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.430
 what are these pants and such put them 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.230
 in drawers and skirts all in one drawer in 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.980
 the bar we can talk about clothes by 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.580
 colors or shapes I for example 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.560
 I have a combination of the two that is 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.200
 good if you see it by colors that is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.940
 Light colors 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.260
 in the left part and dark in 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.500
 the one on the right 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.660
 I'm not going from white to black and I'm doing 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 the tones but light colors and 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.640
 dark so that it looks mohsÃ©n see a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.440
 harmony and then by ways is to say there 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.000
 I have three long-sleeved things 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.390
 quarter shirts short sleeve shirts 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.460
 here without sleeveless suspenders and then I do 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.580
 as the transition already as a turquoise and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.070
 I'm going to do the blues and blacks 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.350
 and there I also have what good 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.150
 dresses and things like that a little bit more 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.510
 long that if you notice there I have a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.640
 drawer - which is for yourself to be able 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.860
 place longer things and then then 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.820
 I still have three sleeveless things 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.510
 quarters long sleeves and in the tones that 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.760
 there because either black or navy look closely not 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.390
 there is nothing of red or violet tones nor 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.720
 colors so 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.660
 oranges I do not know more different these 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 I have in a drawer so I do not break 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.020
 both visually to be a wardrobe 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.240
 open I do not like that there are colors of 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.880
 suddenly they do not understand each other 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.160
 thing is important are the hangers that 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.650
 They are all the same whether wood 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.959
 black white plastic of equal but 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.030
 that are to be able to be if it is a closet 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.209
 especially open that all the hangers 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.310
 are equal on the shelves what I do 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.970
 is thus to place the complements that 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.250
 it is more often use vale to have them more 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.400
 at the hands of the rest of it together in drawers 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.220
 apart and so I have them more at hand by 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.930
 example here I have necklaces and rings and 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.870
 I also have, as you can see, a couple of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.110
 Flowers placed for a little bit of 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.980
 decoration with two belts that usually 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.140
 use quite then in this I have then 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.700
 earrings bracelets and sunglasses 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.160
 also in the back with two 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.200
 fabular is to tie in wants a little 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.880
 more decorative to look at and then here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.060
 I have therefore the two bags that more soil 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.069
 use 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.200
 and scarves on both sides and also a 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.510
 necklace in the middle with rings good this 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.040
 it's the way I put things 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.930
 on the shelves so I can stay 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.940
 so that it is practical so that they do not have 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.650
 to always be looking for costume jewelery 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.720
 there is no weaving of the hand that is what 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.250
 it is usually used more then it is 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.220
 used in particular could move the drawer 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.950
 let's look a little at the drawers here 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.950
 what we have in long pants 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.950
 basically 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.400
 here 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 what we have are shorts like that is plan 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.280
 more casual jeans then here I have 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.239
 more as well as to dress and here then the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.720
 skirts 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.760
 that I also put them in the same drawer 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.650
 then below 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.320
 I have that is what I told you 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.720
 T-shirts that I try more or less to fold 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.230
 all with the same width using a 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.880
 cardboard if you do not know how I do not know 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.880
 I can make a video on instagram or something 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.550
 so for you to see it here I have for 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.350
 example the braces here I have the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.430
 Short sleeve shirts and logo is 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.430
 a little progress and 2 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.550
 the last one we have are things like that 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.020
 the beach bikinis hats 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.930
 things also from the pool the hat 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.110
 of the performance and also a couple of 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.569
 necklaces on the left side in 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.740
 these two I have 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.740
 good here the lack 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.560
 in sportswear 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.050
 and help down good are parts of 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.640
 up t-shirts and on the bottom 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.320
 I have sweat pants if you have 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.990
 less space what I would do would be for 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.390
 example put these two drawers together 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.760
 the top and bottom of clothing 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.430
 sport and you can even put together 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.200
 the one on the beach, for example, is worth three 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.790
 drawers in one because I for example if 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.000
 You see, I have it separated because it's going 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.160
 ok but I have a lot of room 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.470
 so I do it like that later in this 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.010
 here 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.370
 I have what pajamas are 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.100
 Leggings underwear and in the one underneath 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.420
 I have 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.420
 bags 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.430
 I have all the bags here and up in 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.980
 the top part those that more floor 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.110
 use that those that I use the most I have them out 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.760
 to not have to be in the drawer but 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.020
 the ones I use the most from the others 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.480
 I put up here to not have to 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.390
 be looking like this below and pulling out 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.340
 all the layers that is from bags under 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.510
 so I do so the theme of the 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.420
 shoes I have them on the bottom 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.330
 therefore I start by heel and then 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.870
 behind and as comfortable as that for the 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.380
 summer in sandals plan 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.940
 flat and the wedges and then there the 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.410
 sports also if you see I have 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.730
 placed one forward and another 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.410
 back to fit a couple more of 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.030
 shoes and also to make it look good 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.950
 the shoe and then also in the part of 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.380
 up then top part are 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.600
 shoes that are more winter like that 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.880
 topics and saved and there I have then 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.009
 coats and jackets and things like that 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.960
 winter in those there 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.599
 an advice that I give you this way to keep 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.460
 a little the order is always that you go to 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.219
 good first of all when you have the 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.199
 wardrobe placed well placed yours 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:10.020
 to take a picture, so you know 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.849
 how you had it because sometimes you start 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.710
 to take things out to test them and such and 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.149
 which one and you forget completely how 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.619
 tennis and other times I told you to break the 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:18.389
 head down to put it back 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:21.899
 then it is a picture when you have it 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.369
 ready and so you can always look and then 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:26.129
 another thing is that if for example you go to 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:28.559
 take a shirt, not for example me 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.219
 I know is always saying his perch in his 

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:31.860
 site 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:33.569
 yes, when you see what it is already 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.249
 you know what's going to go because you have the 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:37.110
 not hollow so far the video I hope 

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:39.449
 that you liked it if you liked it 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.759
 you know how to like and 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:45.800
 subscribe to the channel and how good we 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.800
 we see in the next video see you later
