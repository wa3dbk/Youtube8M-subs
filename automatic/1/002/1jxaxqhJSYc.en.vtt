00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello guys! 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.209
 let's go to the 13th round of the championship 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.459
 Brazilian 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.789
 Come on, people first wanted to send 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.789
 a save there the staff of the super group 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 tips on facebook a group is very 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.980
 nice, which I have immense honor 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 honor of administering 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 It's really cool the group people there. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 staff interacting enough who still 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.220
 not part of the group you can click the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.420
 link that I'll leave in the description of the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.470
 video below requests participation 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.360
 We accept beauty there, just go in there. 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.380
 who wants 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 happy with the score of the vast majority 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.950
 there in the previous round was well of the government 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.190
 the group comments and let's go to this 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.620
 thirteenth round is as follows 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.320
 I can not say it again 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.080
 for those who already know even a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.330
 But there are plenty of people who still 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 do not know then who wants to value 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 players who 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
 devalued in the last round and that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.940
 be reasonable reasonably cheap 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 players who do not exceed 15 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.370
 These are the players who 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.530
 have a tendency to appreciate clearly that 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.020
 the organization also depends a little on the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 but at this point in the championship it is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.030
 practically discarded is more the same 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.380
 score and if he devalued the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:46.110
 value in the previous round and beauty 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.970
 now about this round we give 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.850
 a look at the championship table at 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.799
 people see that the two teams that have the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.409
 chance of theological punctuation are 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 grêmio and são paulo 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.460
 the team playing against the Basque at home 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 the Basque is falling apart and is 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.659
 paulo playing against coritiba at home 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.610
 against the coritiba at home that does not 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.829
 come well 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.279
 Someone will ask the 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.279
 International 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 the super tips will not go with any player 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.900
 international 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.569
 first because I give three reasons to 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.780
 You will not go international players. 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.930
 I can even break my face but others 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.040
 motives first plays liberators in the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.840
 Wednesday 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
 I doubt that any player of the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.290
 international entered the field without being 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.549
 thinking at least a little bit about 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
 liberators 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.139
 second, I doubt anyone will go 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.879
 complete 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.439
 he does not go full-time or 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.319
 when there are no liberators 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.120
 Imagine with liberators suddenly I 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.709
 What am I doing with this video? 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.180
 receive a call from being called to 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.310
 play on the inter team now at the end of 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.109
 The week I called the light. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.750
 Are you on the team? 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.939
 you'll play you suddenly you are 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.500
 watching this video is scaled to 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.790
 play on the inter team have to travel 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.599
 to santa catarina at the end of 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.419
 week 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.370
 The third reason joinville won the 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.310
 Classic 2 to 0 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.810
 packaged whether or not it is packaged and 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.120
 Do you know what you 're thinking? 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 liberators 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.930
 so you already have reasons to change 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.139
 the non- international girl 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.659
 I'll stop reading the money and I'll go 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.209
 show the squad of the super team 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.650
 tips for this 13th round 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.799
 so come as the goalkeeper Marcelo 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.629
 Godoy Guild could not be too 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.209
 different staff if you want to 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.650
 rogério ceni is also well served 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.259
 but the goalkeeper is very well 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.359
 served in this league takes the Basque in 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.459
 Basque house does not come at all well 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.099
 the team comes packaged despite having 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.400
 lost away from home to the chapecoense 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:02.069
 at home should win from the Basque there maybe 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.810
 marcelo marciel work a little not 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.870
 I know but it's a great option for this 13th 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.829
 round with the first lateral reinaldo 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:19.199
 São Paulo is an inexpensive player. 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:22.019
 coritiba at home should be good then great 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.120
 round option as the second side 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.820
 marcelo oliveira's Overview 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.580
 Oliveira is a guy who attacks a guy well 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.030
 who defends well is a cheap player the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.910
 player 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.370
 reasonably good average playing against 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.680
 the Basque at home should well 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.740
 first defender rafael tolói are 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.780
 paulo playing against coritiba at home 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.060
 should not suffer a goal 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.990
 it should be g besides being a good 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.180
 defender then great option for round 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 according to defender Pedro Geromel Grêmio 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.110
 I prefer rhodolfo but unfortunately 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.480
 is injured 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.790
 so let 's go from pedro geromel to 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.380
 same reasons of marcelo oliveira and 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.550
 grog playing against the Basque at home 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:10.080
 should as well as 1 st to 6:30 a.m. cruise 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.870
 devalued in the last round enough 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.090
 has a tendency to value in picking up 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.170
 the goiás at home although it focused 4 to 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.910
 1 not saints 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.990
 the cruise is better than the saints 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.380
 playing at home must even beat goiás and 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.820
 to scratch the eta has great chances of well 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.130
 as the second half michel boils are 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.470
 Paulo could not be very different I think 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.480
 who will be one of the biggest players 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.460
 most scaled in this round and playing 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.340
 against the coritiba at home big chance 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.160
 right there the michel bastos as a third 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.960
 Julian half must also be a player 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.000
 very isolated in this round because 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.620
 devalued in the past round has 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.200
 tendency to value has an average 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.810
 very good and plays against the Basque at home 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.940
 I confess to you that I almost used 4 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:59.090
 4 2 to put otávio lito otávio é 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.050
 myth 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:06.120
 otávio should and must be well again 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.890
 played against the Fluminense in 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.900
 house must have to be stolen 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.970
 who wants to climb who has 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:17.000
 cartoons who are not afraid to lose 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:19.680
 Recommend this page 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.200
 beauty problem that she valued too much in 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.870
 last round and should value this 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.510
 So that's a reason we do not 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:32.610
 have assembled a 4 4 2 taking with him but 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.470
 is recommended as an attacker 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.630
 first attacker ricardo oliveira nothing 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.660
 more is than the top scorer of the championship 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.310
 then undeniable arguably playing when 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.850
 the figueirense at home even the saints 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.130
 all evil can well 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.389
 second luan greyhound attacker 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.610
 players who have one of the best 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.990
 average of the attackers devalued in 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.139
 last round 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.880
 If you should value this game well 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.720
 against the Basque at home has chances to 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.419
 making the goal of care last as 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.060
 third striker alexandre duck are 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.190
 paulo and if it tends to devalue 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.080
 but as we do we had to score 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.970
 then there's the alexandre duck that has 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.400
 chances of playing well against the 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.039
 coritiba and even goal or 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.949
 assistance as a technician 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.289
 it is fair that is today Ax 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.690
 I do not think I'm going to have a good 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.729
 average against Vasco with the score 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.690
 coach is nothing more than the average of 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:33.000
 players 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:35.729
 then roger's there is this ax guild 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.639
 for this 13th round 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:40.110
 Our team is this one of the team. 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.880
 pretty in sao paulo 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.990
 I think it can not be too much. 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.789
 Different, I hope you enjoy it. 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.690
 I hope that people go well that people 

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:54.979
 can greatly help you you have 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:59.460
 a good base set time for you guys 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:08:00.210
 beauty for this thirteenth round is 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.550
 that 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.550
 A big hug and see you later
