00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
buildings in Lego and I've made quite a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.509 
buildings in Lego and I've made quite a
few<00:00:09.660> already<00:00:09.900> but<00:00:10.650> then<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.010> couple<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.400> my

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519

heart<00:01:32.729> failure<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> muscular<00:01:33.780> dystrophy<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
heart failure and muscular dystrophy so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.179 
heart failure and muscular dystrophy so
I<00:01:34.890> try<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.220> use<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.700> stadium<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.829> peel<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I try to use this stadium to the peel to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
I try to use this stadium to the peel to
donors<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> maybe<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> donor<00:01:39.869> makes<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
donors and maybe if the donor makes a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
donors and maybe if the donor makes a
donation<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> research<00:01:41.340> program<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
donation to the research program that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
donation to the research program that
mean<00:01:42.000> my<00:01:42.150> colleagues<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> maybe<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.649> put

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
mean my colleagues have maybe I can put

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340 
mean my colleagues have maybe I can put
a<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:44.490> Lego<00:01:45.000> fig<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.540> their<00:01:45.780> name<00:01:45.990> into<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a little Lego fig in their name into the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
a little Lego fig in their name into the
stadium<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.460> over<00:01:47.850> time<00:01:48.000> try<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> fill

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
stadium and then over time try to fill

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.030 
stadium and then over time try to fill
it<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> money<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> for

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it up and with the money use it for

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
it up and with the money use it for
medical<00:01:50.369> research<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> world<00:01:51.479> will

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
medical research how in the world will

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
medical research how in the world will
you<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> vase<00:01:53.130> if

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you get this thing out of the vase if

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
you get this thing out of the vase if
you<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.240> closely<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:54.840> some<00:01:55.140> seams<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you look closely you see some seams in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
you look closely you see some seams in
the<00:01:55.740> stadium<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.640> actually<00:01:56.790> take<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the stadium so I can actually take it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.600 
the stadium so I can actually take it
apart<00:01:57.600> into<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:58.079> ten<00:01:58.710> sections<00:01:58.979> plus<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
apart into about ten sections plus the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.920 
apart into about ten sections plus the
field<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> each<00:02:00.780> section<00:02:01.290> weighs<00:02:02.479> about<00:02:03.479> 40

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
field and each section weighs about 40

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
field and each section weighs about 40
to<00:02:04.229> 60<00:02:04.829> pounds<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> should<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.549> able<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
to 60 pounds so I should be able to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.449 
to 60 pounds so I should be able to
carry<00:02:06.270> each<00:02:06.509> section<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.740> transport<00:02:08.399> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
carry each section up and transport it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.040 
carry each section up and transport it
to<00:02:08.610> somewhere<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> set<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> course

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to somewhere to set it up and of course

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.869 
to somewhere to set it up and of course
no<00:02:10.319> pressure<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.770> trying<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.220> make<00:02:11.550> sure<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
no pressure on trying to make sure you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.990 
no pressure on trying to make sure you
transport<00:02:12.360> valid

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
transport valid

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.690 
transport valid
breaking<00:02:13.360> yeah<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.810> try<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.470> build<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.310> pretty

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
breaking yeah I try to build it a pretty

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270 
breaking yeah I try to build it a pretty
sturdy<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:17.200> was<00:02:17.380> kind<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.620> designed<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.160> be

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
sturdy so it was kind of designed to be

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130 
sturdy so it was kind of designed to be
transported<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> inside<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> stadium<00:02:19.930> is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
transported so the inside the stadium is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.650 
transported so the inside the stadium is
completely<00:02:20.290> solid<00:02:20.880> both<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.090> base<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.600> the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
completely solid both the base and the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.740 
completely solid both the base and the
stands<00:02:23.170> everything<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.680> solid<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.330> even<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.510> it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
stands everything is solid so even if it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.110 
stands everything is solid so even if it
would<00:02:26.110> drop<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.770> would<00:02:26.980> probably<00:02:27.640> break<00:02:27.820> into

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
would drop it would probably break into

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.880 
would drop it would probably break into
a<00:02:28.150> couple<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.600> major<00:02:28.720> sections<00:02:29.320> whereas<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:29.800> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
a couple of major sections whereas if I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.320 
a couple of major sections whereas if I
would<00:02:30.070> have<00:02:30.160> built<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.520> hollow<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.060> would<00:02:31.240> have

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
would have built it hollow it would have

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.260 
would have built it hollow it would have
shattered<00:02:32.020> into<00:02:32.530> too<00:02:33.100> many<00:02:33.280> many<00:02:33.610> small<00:02:34.000> bits

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
shattered into too many many small bits

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.750 
shattered into too many many small bits
so<00:02:34.900> I'm<00:02:35.320> pretty<00:02:35.530> I'm<00:02:36.010> convinced<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.580> can

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
so I'm pretty I'm convinced I can

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.020 
so I'm pretty I'm convinced I can
transport<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.300> without<00:02:37.540> too<00:02:37.780> much<00:02:37.900> problem

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
transport it without too much problem

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.750 
transport it without too much problem
what<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> build<00:02:40.300> next<00:02:40.540> after<00:02:41.020> this<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.760> we

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
what do you build next after this and we

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.940 
what do you build next after this and we
I<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.150> really<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.510> plans<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> outside

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I don't really have plans on the outside

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.180 
I don't really have plans on the outside
of<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.130> stadium<00:02:45.370> there's<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.850> couple<00:02:46.540> of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of the stadium there's a couple of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.440 
of the stadium there's a couple of
squares<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.459> can<00:02:48.640> fill<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.120> I'm<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
squares that I can fill so I'm going to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.449 
squares that I can fill so I'm going to
build<00:02:49.600> some<00:02:49.810> smaller<00:02:50.140> things<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.220> nearly

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
build some smaller things so not nearly

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.220 
build some smaller things so not nearly
million<00:02:51.940> bricks<00:02:52.120> maybe<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.510> thousand<00:02:53.080> bricks

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
million bricks maybe a thousand bricks

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.190 
million bricks maybe a thousand bricks
so<00:02:53.670> relatively<00:02:54.670> small<00:02:55.030> things<00:02:55.330> I'm<00:02:55.540> trying<00:02:55.870> to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
so relatively small things I'm trying to

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.570 
so relatively small things I'm trying to
think<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.650> things<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.370> are

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
think of things that are

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.610 
think of things that are
football-related<00:02:57.880> such<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.930> national

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
football-related such as the national

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.380 
football-related such as the national
championship<00:03:00.070> trophy<00:03:00.489> or<00:03:00.670> maybe<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.239> little

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
championship trophy or maybe a little

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.720 
championship trophy or maybe a little
like<00:03:02.050> one<00:03:02.350> foot<00:03:02.560> tall<00:03:02.800> statue<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.340> Heisman

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
like one foot tall statue of the Heisman

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 
like one foot tall statue of the Heisman
Trophy<00:03:04.090> things<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.200> I'm<00:03:05.440> not

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
Trophy things like that so I'm not

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.710 
Trophy things like that so I'm not
planning<00:03:05.830> anything<00:03:06.160> big<00:03:06.489> for<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.420> next

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
planning anything big for the next

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.440 
planning anything big for the next
couple<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.860> months<00:03:09.010> years<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.270> never

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
couple of months years but you never

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.030 
couple of months years but you never
know<00:03:10.630> what<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.140> challenges<00:03:11.620> provide

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
know what what challenges provide

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.740 
know what what challenges provide
themselves<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.670> how<00:03:13.150> many<00:03:13.209> bricks<00:03:13.510> did<00:03:13.660> you

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
themselves and how many bricks did you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.710 
themselves and how many bricks did you
say<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.230> close<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.310> million<00:03:15.550> bricks<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
say really close to a million bricks the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.080 
say really close to a million bricks the
most<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.920> them<00:03:18.040> are<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> base<00:03:18.580> because<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
most of them are in the base because the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.390 
most of them are in the base because the
field<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.750> ohio<00:03:20.049> stadium<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.799> actually<00:03:21.190> lower

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
field of ohio stadium is actually lower

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.430 
field of ohio stadium is actually lower
than<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.820> surrounding<00:03:22.030> street<00:03:22.570> level<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.410> I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
than the surrounding street level so I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.170 
than the surrounding street level so I
first<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.890> had<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.070> build<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.430> base<00:03:24.610> that's<00:03:24.940> about

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
first I had to build a base that's about

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.360 
first I had to build a base that's about
three<00:03:25.420> inches<00:03:25.750> tall<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.860> make<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.040> sturdy

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
three inches tall and to make it sturdy

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.340 
three inches tall and to make it sturdy
I<00:03:27.549> build<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:27.970> completely<00:03:28.510> solid<00:03:28.810> with<00:03:29.110> many

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
I build a completely solid with many

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.440 
I build a completely solid with many
little<00:03:29.709> plates<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.580> that's<00:03:31.209> why<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
little plates so that that's why the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.020 
little plates so that that's why the
piece<00:03:31.750> counter<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:32.320> high<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.739> got<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.519> I

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
piece counter so high I got you and I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.240 
piece counter so high I got you and I
mean<00:03:34.239> even<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.570> field<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.110> Lego<00:03:35.620> yeah<00:03:36.130> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
mean even the field is Lego yeah the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.310 
mean even the field is Lego yeah the
field<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.610> Lego<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.720> order<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.140> get

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
field is Lego and and in order to get

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.289 
field is Lego and and in order to get
all<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.709> numbers<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.700> smoothness<00:03:40.000> in

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
all the numbers and the smoothness in

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.090 
all the numbers and the smoothness in
the<00:03:40.390> field<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.750> use<00:03:40.900> them<00:03:41.049> sideways<00:03:41.320> so

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
the field I use them sideways so

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.800 
the field I use them sideways so
throughout<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.880> stadium<00:03:43.090> I've<00:03:43.450> built<00:03:43.690> some

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
throughout the stadium I've built some

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.930 
throughout the stadium I've built some
bricks<00:03:44.220> traditionally<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.430> upward<00:03:45.730> fashion

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
bricks traditionally in upward fashion

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.030 
bricks traditionally in upward fashion
and<00:03:46.329> some<00:03:46.540> sideways<00:03:47.019> or<00:03:47.320> some<00:03:47.500> upside<00:03:47.860> down

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and some sideways or some upside down

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.280 
and some sideways or some upside down
and<00:03:48.310> for<00:03:48.549> some<00:03:48.730> breaks<00:03:48.970> even<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.840> back<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
and for some breaks even the back of the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.539 
and for some breaks even the back of the
brick<00:03:50.470> looks<00:03:50.620> better<00:03:50.920> than<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.160> front<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.430> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
brick looks better than the front of the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.330 
brick looks better than the front of the
brick<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:52.510> turn<00:03:52.900> them<00:03:53.049> inside<00:03:53.230> out<00:03:53.410> it's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
brick so I turn them inside out it's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.340 
brick so I turn them inside out it's
amazing<00:03:54.640> how<00:03:54.910> much<00:03:55.329> planning<00:03:55.660> did<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.170> have

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
amazing how much planning did you have

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.400 
amazing how much planning did you have
to<00:03:56.500> put<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:57.420> for<00:03:58.420> some<00:03:58.570> sections<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.079> lot<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
to put in for some sections a lot of

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.800 
to put in for some sections a lot of
planning<00:03:59.620> like<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.190> curve<00:04:00.579> sections<00:04:01.090> was<00:04:01.360> was

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
planning like the curve sections was was

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.050 
planning like the curve sections was was
very<00:04:02.019> challenging<00:04:02.290> but<00:04:03.070> in<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.310> South<00:04:03.519> stands

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
very challenging but in the South stands

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.370 
very challenging but in the South stands
because<00:04:04.239> they're<00:04:04.600> pretty<00:04:04.870> much<00:04:04.959> straight

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
because they're pretty much straight

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.069 
because they're pretty much straight
there<00:04:05.739> they're<00:04:06.100> very<00:04:06.730> easy<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.900> build

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
there they're very easy so I can build

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.440 
there they're very easy so I can build
the<00:04:08.230> South<00:04:08.470> stance<00:04:08.829> and<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.090> couple<00:04:10.239> of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
the South stance and in just a couple of

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.590 
the South stance and in just a couple of
days<00:04:10.600> without<00:04:11.280> much<00:04:12.280> planning<00:04:12.489> but<00:04:13.239> for<00:04:13.510> the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
days without much planning but for the

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.690 
days without much planning but for the
to<00:04:13.900> get<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.170> round<00:04:14.500> shape<00:04:14.620> right<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.430> needed

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
to get the round shape right I needed

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.880 
to get the round shape right I needed
quite<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.209> bit<00:04:16.390> of<00:04:16.479> planning<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.019> on<00:04:17.620> some

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
quite a bit of planning so on some

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.949 
quite a bit of planning so on some
sections<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.400> spent<00:04:18.700> more<00:04:19.180> time<00:04:19.239> planning<00:04:19.630> an

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
sections I spent more time planning an

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.990 
sections I spent more time planning an
actual<00:04:20.260> building<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:21.340> notice<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.820> there

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
actual building and I notice that there

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.550 
actual building and I notice that there
are<00:04:22.120> no<00:04:22.270> stickers<00:04:22.720> really<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.140> mean<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:23.410> did

that<00:05:24.310> build<00:05:24.520> like<00:05:24.910> skyscrapers<00:05:25.210> houses

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
that build like skyscrapers houses

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.020 
that build like skyscrapers houses
trained<00:05:26.410> so<00:05:26.680> it's<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.250> it's<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.520> hobby<00:05:27.699> that's

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030
