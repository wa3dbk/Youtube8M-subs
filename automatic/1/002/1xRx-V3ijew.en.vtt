00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.330
 the blog your baby genius blogspot.com 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.580
 presents stimulation toys 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.620
 early the game is a fundamental part 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.720
 of the child's life through play 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.209
 the baby interacts with the outside world 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.999
 he knows him and learns about everything that 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.880
 surrounds while it's fun 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:24.099
 should stimulate the child not only be a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.839
 mere pastime because the absence of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.359
 stimulation in the baby and in the child 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.739
 will endanger its very evolution by 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.989
 that's why the toys must be 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.579
 properly chosen allows you to display 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.410
 in a list of the basic toys 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.930
 you have to have the baby rugs 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.179
 for babies when I'm about 34 months 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.160
 You can put it upside down and stimulate it 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.989
 so he can raise his head to 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.640
 that he can develop his back like this 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.920
 and to begin to develop their 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.539
 arms and legs trying to beat in 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.309
 this stage also the baby reacts 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.620
 before stimuli with the sounds forms 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.780
 textures and colors starts to fix its 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.879
 examining attention around him and 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.010
 will end up identifying situations and 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.320
 people must physically acquire 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.969
 greater strength in the legs arms and in 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.070
 the neck you have to choose events that 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.570
 be very striking however have 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.440
 be careful that they are toys that are not 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.060
 damage 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.010
 not the main toys that 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.200
 stimulate the baby are the books with 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.430
 high contrast images these books 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.860
 They are usually made with 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.690
 drawings in red or black lines 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.580
 thick and showy on a background 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.440
 white since the red color is one of 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.480
 the first colors that he continues with his 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.340
 eyes then there is the black both on the 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.080
 white background you'll take advantage so much for 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.070
 develop your sight as to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.810
 develop 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.180
 then you can take advantage to tell 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.700
 stories and stories he will love 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.470
 mobile phones and mobile phones will call a lot 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.900
 baby's attention because they usually move 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.850
 very slowly and the baby in the first 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.800
 months of your life you will learn to fix the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.900
 view and to follow objects try that 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.240
 be mobile of shapes and colors 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.950
 eye-catching mirrors for babies are 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.140
 very important because the baby will 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.630
 love to look and play with your figure 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.760
 It is also very important that the pp go 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.310
 getting to know ibis skeletons and what will happen 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.350
 realize how beautiful it is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 plasticized or bits not also 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.580
 known as intelligence bits 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.600
 It has economic shape we can find 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.610
 in the market 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.250
 plasticized photographs with 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.420
 pictures of animals I'm delighted 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.430
 to the baby 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.080
 this photograph will be part of the first 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.790
 stimulation of general knowledge that 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.080
 you leave your baby for it you have to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.880
 go showing each of the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.569
 animal templates and saying the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.870
 name for example lion elephant bear 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.730
 panda zebra and even and to do it more 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.739
 exciting you can imitate the sound of 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.630
 every animal your baby will love 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.819
 boards and button toys with 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.200
 sounds from 8 months of age 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.269
 Babies usually longer be able to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.340
 sit and then start 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.170
 crawl and the subjects with buttons and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.060
 sounds are important as they stimulate 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.980
 to the baby on the principle of action and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 reaction then every time you press 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 a button will sound an animal can be a 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.970
 cat or a cow a dog or any 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.739
 another animal on the farm for example is 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.390
 very important to distinguish between the two 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.100
 kinds of toys that are digital 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.680
 which run on battery power when 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.250
 press a button will sound 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.200
 automatically but it is also 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.790
 important that you have analogous toys is 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.310
 to say as if it were is that you can 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.290
 play with your hands marimbas or others 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.150
 musical instruments that are analogous 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.860
 that will also make a sound that for him 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.920
 It will be very funny when he 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.480
 hit balls for babies will develop its 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.580
 motor skills often have 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.410
 built-in rattles inside 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.480
 who usually grab the ball 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.760
 we will stimulate the psychomotor development 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.750
 of baby volume management sizes and 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.460
 different colors 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.740
 will stimulate your sensory perception 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.830
 usually suggest the ball as a 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.450
 toy that encourages the baby to crawl and 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.020
 I make a parenthesis to mention that the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.760
 cat is extremely important the search of 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.610
 stimulate the baby's exteriors of a 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.340
 way you have no idea you'll find a 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.750
 great difference in intelligence and in 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.790
 the development of a baby that has 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.800
 crawled and one that there is no guarantee but 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.230
 we will post a video with reference 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.260
 we'll leave it here so you can 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.510
 see cubes and pieces to assemble towers 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.400
 man love easy to assemble 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.530
 towers at the beginning look at the pieces 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.570
 be large and secure so that the pp does not 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.920
 hit buckets lined with material 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.680
 soft so the baby does not get hurt 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.020
 will stimulate your motor skills and to enchant 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.450
 small arming and putting toys 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.280
 pieces inside teach you with patience and 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.769
 with a lot of love and above all with a lot 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.240
 fun that is the basic principle 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.069
 should put each piece where 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.259
 corresponds can be pieces that already 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:28.539
 have the geometric figure for example 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.550
 a triangle a circle a square or 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.470
 it can be as simple as a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.569
 container where he can go taking out and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.430
 putting the pieces and something very 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.099
 important that you do not have to forget is 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.870
 that when you have about 7 or 8 months when 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.389
 he can walk or beat you will notice 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.190
 that he plays with toys about 58 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.620
 minutes and leave them and then 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.330
 they will begin to explore the whole house in 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.830
 look for objects that are not toys 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.530
 but that will be very interesting for him 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.050
 for example the box that you can see in the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.610
 photograph your curiosity is insatiable and 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 when I can walk, just barely 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.630
 they look at the toys and try 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.490
 explore the world around them for 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.919
 look for another way to play and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.470
 satisfy your need for knowledge 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.139
 and learning to be taken to 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.449
 the mouth to touch that smell that look and 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.520
 to throw so do not bother when 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.580
 I threw something to the ground as it was totally 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.009
 natural and part of their learning but 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.349
 especially something very important saturate it 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.659
 of toys hinders their creativity in 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.139
 instead of developing do not commit that 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.849
 error 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.189
 if you are not seriously attacking 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.469
 against their creativity and the only thing that 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.139
 you will achieve is that then you do not value anything in 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.610
 life better leave it than explore everything and 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.710
 especially teach him that he has 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.590
 creativity to put together their own 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.719
 toys with the objects around you 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.729
 sometimes the simple the simple is the best 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.319
 for the baby very well is the video you 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.090
 I liked it, I hope you give us a like 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.680
 but above all I hope you put it in 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.930
 practice with your baby do not forget either
