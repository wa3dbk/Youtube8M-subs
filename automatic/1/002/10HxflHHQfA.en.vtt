00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
all right so we are getting into lab 3

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.539 
all right so we are getting into lab 3
which<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.669> all<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:02.970> microscopy<00:00:03.950> all<00:00:04.950> about

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
which is all about microscopy all about

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.039 
which is all about microscopy all about
the<00:00:05.670> microscope<00:00:06.120> all<00:00:06.540> right<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:06.810> we're<00:00:06.960> gonna

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the microscope all right so we're gonna

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.020 
the microscope all right so we're gonna
start<00:00:07.319> off<00:00:07.410> with<00:00:07.470> two<00:00:07.740> main<00:00:07.919> things<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
start off with two main things just the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.820 
start off with two main things just the
care<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.480> microscopes<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
care of the microscopes and how to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.890 
care of the microscopes and how to
handle<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> slides<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.750> you're

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
handle the slides so when you're

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780 
handle the slides so when you're
carrying<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.290> microscope<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.160> want<00:00:14.610> two

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
carrying the microscope you want two

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.510 
carrying the microscope you want two
hands<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> bottom<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
hands on it one on the bottom one on the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.330 
hands on it one on the bottom one on the
handle<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.199> you<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> be

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
handle and you just really want to be

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.370 
handle and you just really want to be
delicate<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.510> got<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> lot<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.080> fun

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
delicate with it it's got a lot of fun

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.279 
delicate with it it's got a lot of fun
little<00:00:22.740> things<00:00:23.420> pieces<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.630> tie<00:00:24.960> into<00:00:25.260> each

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
little things pieces that tie into each

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.130 
little things pieces that tie into each
other<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.460> more<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> jostle<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.869> more

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
other so the more you jostle it the more

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
other so the more you jostle it the more
quickly<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.060> quicker<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.720> kind

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
quickly the quicker it's going to kind

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.520 
quickly the quicker it's going to kind
of<00:00:31.080> break<00:00:31.349> fall<00:00:31.619> apart<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.610> right<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.530> don't

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
of break fall apart all right so don't

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.889 
of break fall apart all right so don't
slide<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.280> across<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.880> tabletop<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.690> pick

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
slide it across the tabletop just pick

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.780 
slide it across the tabletop just pick
it<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> down<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.140> be

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
it up put it down you know just be

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
it up put it down you know just be
gentle<00:00:41.790> when<00:00:42.180> handling<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.140> right<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
gentle when handling it all right and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.709 
gentle when handling it all right and
that<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> goes<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that kind of goes the same for the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.569 
that kind of goes the same for the
slides<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:46.920> handling<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> sized

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
slides when you're handling the sized

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.670 
slides when you're handling the sized
slides<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.570> look<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> picture<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
slides you can look at that picture and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.490 
slides you can look at that picture and
see<00:00:49.890> he's<00:00:50.370> holding<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.480> either<00:00:51.809> end<00:00:52.110> he's<00:00:52.320> not

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
see he's holding on either end he's not

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
see he's holding on either end he's not
holding<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> over<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.940> middle<00:00:54.239> where<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
holding it over the middle where the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.830 
holding it over the middle where the
specimen<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.969> when<00:00:57.270> you're<00:00:57.390> putting

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
specimen is you know when you're putting

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139 
specimen is you know when you're putting
it<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> case<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.430> taking<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> out

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it and into the case and taking it out

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.900 
it and into the case and taking it out
just<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.719> delicate<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.710> gentle<00:01:02.160> don't

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
just be delicate with it be gentle don't

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.969 
just be delicate with it be gentle don't
put<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.270> top<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> counter<00:01:03.870> top<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
put it on top of the counter top the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
put it on top of the counter top the
table<00:01:05.309> tops<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.540> where<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.110> went

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
table tops because that's where it went

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.450 
table tops because that's where it went
tends<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.580> knocked<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.130> really<00:01:11.130> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
tends to be knocked off and really just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
tends to be knocked off and really just
be<00:01:12.299> gentle<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.409> things<00:01:13.680> they're

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
be gentle with all these things they're

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
be gentle with all these things they're
expensive<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.180> an<00:01:15.299> average<00:01:15.450> slide<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
expensive you know an average slide is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.370 
expensive you know an average slide is
around<00:01:16.939> $75<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.210> microscopes<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.200> got

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
around $75 and microscopes that we got

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.289 
around $75 and microscopes that we got
about<00:01:19.890> 7,500<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.140> imagine<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
about 7,500 so you can imagine it's

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.249 
about 7,500 so you can imagine it's
difficult<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.390> replace<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.960> we're<00:01:25.049> very

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
difficult to replace them we're very

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
difficult to replace them we're very
expensive<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> least<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.490> replace<00:01:27.060> those

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
expensive at the least to replace those

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.840 
expensive at the least to replace those
so<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:28.229> nice<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.520> hitting<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so be nice when you're hitting the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.560 
so be nice when you're hitting the
microscopes<00:01:30.650> we're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> cover<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.150> bunch

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
microscopes we're going to cover a bunch

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.380 
microscopes we're going to cover a bunch
of<00:01:33.979> structures<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> microscope<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
of structures on the microscope just to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
of structures on the microscope just to
get<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> speed<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.340> sure<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
get you up to speed and make sure that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
get you up to speed and make sure that
everyone's<00:01:39.030> familiar<00:01:39.200> with<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.470> pieces<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
everyone's familiar with the pieces that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
everyone's familiar with the pieces that
we're<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.340> using<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> most<00:01:42.000> all

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we're going to be using the most all

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
we're going to be using the most all
right<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> look<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> things<00:01:44.460> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
right so if you look at the things in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.480 
right so if you look at the things in
blue<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> ocular<00:01:46.829> lens<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
blue it's the ocular lens and the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
blue it's the ocular lens and the
objective<00:01:48.030> lens<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.680> two

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
objective lens and this is these two

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
objective lens and this is these two
things<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.399> give<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> your

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
things are what give you your

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.109 
things are what give you your
magnification<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> ocular<00:01:53.399> lens<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
magnification so the ocular lens has a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.310 
magnification so the ocular lens has a
10x<00:01:55.250> magnification<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.479> objective<00:01:58.079> lens

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
10x magnification and the objective lens

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.520 
10x magnification and the objective lens
it<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.250> depends<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.390> objective<00:02:01.380> lens

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it really depends on what objective lens

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.969 
it really depends on what objective lens
you<00:02:01.680> were<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.520> range<00:02:02.820> from<00:02:03.030> 4<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.320> 400

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you were on but they range from 4 to 400

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.350 
you were on but they range from 4 to 400
we<00:02:05.640> also<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> thousand<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.079> thousand

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
we also have in a thousand a thousand

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
we also have in a thousand a thousand
magnification<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.569> objectification<00:02:10.400> what

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
magnification or objectification what

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.850 
magnification or objectification what
you<00:02:11.550> shouldn't<00:02:11.970> use<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.690> an<00:02:12.810> oil<00:02:13.020> immersion

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you shouldn't use it's an oil immersion

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.220 
you shouldn't use it's an oil immersion
it's<00:02:14.190> marked<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.640> white<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.150> our<00:02:15.540> microscopes

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it's marked in white on our microscopes

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's marked in white on our microscopes
and<00:02:16.680> really<00:02:17.150> if<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.330> use<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> you're<00:02:18.780> gonna

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and really if you use it you're gonna

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.660 
and really if you use it you're gonna
break<00:02:19.080> your<00:02:19.140> slides<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.250> designed

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
break your slides because it's designed

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.870 
break your slides because it's designed
to<00:02:20.820> be<00:02:21.090> emerged<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.700> oil<00:02:23.990> all<00:02:24.990> right<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.880> when

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to be emerged in oil all right so when

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.010 
to be emerged in oil all right so when
you're<00:02:27.000> figuring<00:02:27.210> out<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.660> total

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
you're figuring out the total

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.970 
you're figuring out the total
magnification

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
magnification

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.290 
magnification
what<00:02:29.160> you're<00:02:29.310> gonna<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.910> you're<00:02:30.240> gonna

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
what you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.840 
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
multiply<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.780> ocular<00:02:31.320> lens<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.550> ten

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
multiply the ocular lens which is ten

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.350 
multiply the ocular lens which is ten
times<00:02:33.660> whatever<00:02:34.140> objective<00:02:34.440> lens<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.360> for

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
times whatever objective lens and for

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.410 
times whatever objective lens and for
example<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> 4x

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
example if you are on a 4x

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
example if you are on a 4x
objectification<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:40.500> multiply<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.130> by<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
objectification you multiply that by the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.000 
objectification you multiply that by the
ocular<00:02:41.820> lens<00:02:42.030> which<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.360> 10<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> 40

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
ocular lens which is 10 so you have a 40

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.260 
ocular lens which is 10 so you have a 40
magnification<00:02:44.960> if<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.170> had<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.650> 40<00:02:47.270> objective

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
magnification if you had a 40 objective

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.790 
magnification if you had a 40 objective
lens<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.630> gonna<00:02:48.720> multiply<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.320> by<00:02:49.410> 10<00:02:49.650> you

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
lens you're gonna multiply it by 10 you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.080 
lens you're gonna multiply it by 10 you
can<00:02:49.890> get<00:02:50.070> 400<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.350> look<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.709> yellow<00:02:53.190> those

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
can get 400 if you look in yellow those

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.430 
can get 400 if you look in yellow those
are<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.360> things<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.600> control<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> amount

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
are the things that control the amount

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
are the things that control the amount
of<00:02:55.620> light<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.890> comes<00:02:56.340> through<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:57.180> called

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
of light that comes through it's called

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.150 
of light that comes through it's called
the<00:02:57.450> condenser<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.440> one<00:02:58.590> that's<00:02:58.709> attached

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
the condenser is the one that's attached

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.420 
the condenser is the one that's attached
to<00:02:59.580> this<00:03:00.150> stage<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.770> gonna<00:03:01.920> control

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
to this stage and this is gonna control

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.699 
to this stage and this is gonna control
the<00:03:02.580> amount<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.850> light<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.360> actually

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
the amount of light that actually

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.230 
the amount of light that actually
accesses<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.220> stage<00:03:05.490> or<00:03:05.670> gets<00:03:05.880> through<00:03:06.090> this

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
accesses the stage or gets through this

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.000 
accesses the stage or gets through this
stage<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.680> look<00:03:07.830> at<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
stage and then you look at the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.720 
stage and then you look at the
illuminator<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.820> that's<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.720> actual

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
illuminator and that's the actual

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.699 
illuminator and that's the actual
basically<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> flashlight<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.660> natural<00:03:13.350> source

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
basically a flashlight a natural source

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.340 
basically a flashlight a natural source
of<00:03:13.830> light<00:03:14.790> all<00:03:15.480> right<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:15.959> notice<00:03:16.320> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
of light all right so if you notice that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.259 
of light all right so if you notice that
your<00:03:16.650> light<00:03:16.890> you're<00:03:17.280> looking<00:03:18.060> through<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
your light you're looking through the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.940 
your light you're looking through the
microscope<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:19.019> too<00:03:19.170> dark<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.709> too

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
microscope and it's too dark or too

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.800 
microscope and it's too dark or too
bright<00:03:19.980> you're<00:03:20.519> gonna<00:03:20.700> mess<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.300> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
bright you're gonna mess with the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.900 
bright you're gonna mess with the
condensers<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> illuminator<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.340> control

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
condensers of the illuminator to control

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.890 
condensers of the illuminator to control
how<00:03:24.660> much<00:03:24.870> light<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.350> accessing<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> slide

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
how much light is accessing the slide

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.690 
how much light is accessing the slide
and<00:03:27.900> when<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.200> use<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.620> get<00:03:28.800> into<00:03:28.980> focus<00:03:29.489> is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
and when you use to get into focus is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.140 
and when you use to get into focus is
the<00:03:30.330> in<00:03:30.630> red<00:03:31.380> here<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.160> course<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.880> fine

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
the in red here is the course in fine

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.630 
the in red here is the course in fine
focus<00:03:33.630> knobs<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.980> course<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.459> what

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
focus knobs and so the course is what

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.100 
focus knobs and so the course is what
you<00:03:35.790> use<00:03:36.000> when<00:03:36.239> you're<00:03:36.360> first<00:03:36.570> starting<00:03:36.690> out

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
you use when you're first starting out

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.340 
you use when you're first starting out
because<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:37.830> gonna<00:03:37.980> make<00:03:38.070> very<00:03:38.850> large

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
because it's gonna make very large

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.590 
because it's gonna make very large
changes<00:03:40.350> as<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.950> move<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.790> fine<00:03:42.030> focus<00:03:42.330> is

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
changes as you move it the fine focus is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.690 
changes as you move it the fine focus is
once<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.930> get<00:03:43.080> almost<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.890> focus<00:03:44.280> with<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
once you get almost in focus with the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.880 
once you get almost in focus with the
course<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.019> use<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.350> fine<00:03:46.560> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
course you see what you use the fine and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.160 
course you see what you use the fine and
that<00:03:47.100> really<00:03:47.370> fine-tunes<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.510> makes<00:03:48.989> it

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
that really fine-tunes it and makes it

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.380 
that really fine-tunes it and makes it
an<00:03:49.260> incredible<00:03:49.680> detail<00:03:50.040> right<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.239> when

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
an incredible detail right and so when

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.090 
an incredible detail right and so when
you're<00:03:51.480> only<00:03:51.630> starting<00:03:52.140> out<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.830> want<00:03:53.010> to

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
you're only starting out you want to

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.800 
you're only starting out you want to
start<00:03:53.340> with<00:03:53.459> what's<00:03:53.700> called<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> scanning

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
start with what's called the scanning

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.090 
start with what's called the scanning
lens<00:03:55.170> which<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.130> also<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:57.080> 4x

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
lens which is also the 4x

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.199 
lens which is also the 4x
objectification<00:03:59.100> right<00:03:59.670> so<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.940> lowest

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
objectification right so the lowest

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.340 
objectification right so the lowest
powered<00:04:00.780> microscope<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.600> lowest<00:04:03.810> powered

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
powered microscope so the lowest powered

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.900 
powered microscope so the lowest powered
a<00:04:04.560> lens<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.550> use<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:05.820> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
a lens that you can use on the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.960 
a lens that you can use on the
microscope<00:04:08.450> that's<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.690> when<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.110> talk<00:04:10.290> about

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
microscope that's it when you talk about

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.400 
microscope that's it when you talk about
the<00:04:11.970> structures<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.630> microscope<00:04:13.170> it's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
the structures on the microscope it's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.460 
the structures on the microscope it's
really<00:04:13.830> they're<00:04:14.160> all<00:04:14.280> designed<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:15.440> make<00:04:16.440> it

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
really they're all designed to make it

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.400 
really they're all designed to make it
easy<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.890> view<00:04:17.220> alright<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.299> for<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.229> lab

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
easy to view alright and so for the lab

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.050 
easy to view alright and so for the lab
that's<00:04:19.650> coming<00:04:19.950> up<00:04:20.040> make<00:04:20.640> sure<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.850> follow

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
that's coming up make sure you follow

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.890 
that's coming up make sure you follow
directions<00:04:21.560> make<00:04:22.560> sure<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:23.039> understand

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
directions make sure that you understand

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.190 
directions make sure that you understand
field<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.080> view<00:04:25.289> all<00:04:25.530> right<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.830> that's

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
field of view all right so that's

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.110 
field of view all right so that's
in<00:04:26.500> your<00:04:26.650> lab<00:04:26.770> manual<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.340> good<00:04:27.490> detail<00:04:27.850> but

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
in your lab manual and good detail but

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.480 
in your lab manual and good detail but
real<00:04:28.690> briefly<00:04:29.110> basically<00:04:29.950> what<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.160> field<00:04:30.370> of

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
real briefly basically what the field of

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.970 
real briefly basically what the field of
view<00:04:30.640> is<00:04:30.820> is<00:04:31.120> what<00:04:31.420> you're<00:04:31.570> looking<00:04:31.900> for<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.770> if

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
view is is what you're looking for so if

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.430 
view is is what you're looking for so if
you<00:04:33.010> increase<00:04:33.790> your<00:04:34.210> field<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.660> view<00:04:34.870> you're

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
you increase your field of view you're

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.530 
you increase your field of view you're
basically<00:04:35.920> able<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.340> see<00:04:36.550> more<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.270> the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
basically able to see more of the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.960 
basically able to see more of the
specimen<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:39.040> it's<00:04:39.220> due<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.670> you're

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
specimen and so it's due that you're

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.180 
specimen and so it's due that you're
lowering<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.960> magnification<00:04:41.710> so<00:04:41.980> if<00:04:42.100> you

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
lowering the magnification so if you

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.250 
lowering the magnification so if you
increase<00:04:42.640> your<00:04:42.790> field<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.150> view<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:44.020> lower

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
increase your field of view you lower

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.470 
increase your field of view you lower
your<00:04:44.470> magnification<00:04:45.030> conversely<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:46.420> you

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
your magnification conversely if you

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.200 
your magnification conversely if you
decrease<00:04:47.110> your<00:04:47.230> field<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.770> view<00:04:47.980> you<00:04:48.910> are

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
decrease your field of view you are

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.300 
decrease your field of view you are
increasing<00:04:49.930> your<00:04:50.140> magnification<00:04:50.590> because

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
increasing your magnification because

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.100 
increasing your magnification because
you're<00:04:51.490> really<00:04:52.030> honing<00:04:52.450> in<00:04:52.720> on<00:04:52.870> one

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
you're really honing in on one

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.980 
you're really honing in on one
particular<00:04:53.620> part<00:04:53.890> of<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.040> specimen<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.990> so

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
particular part of the specimen and so

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.720 
particular part of the specimen and so
you<00:04:56.080> can<00:04:56.290> skip<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> bunch<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:57.040> that<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.460> the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
you can skip a bunch of that of the

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.700 
you can skip a bunch of that of the
reading<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.300> make<00:04:59.260> sure<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.470> do<00:04:59.590> the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
reading and make sure you do the

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.280 
reading and make sure you do the
questions<00:04:59.890> per<00:05:00.250> your<00:05:00.400> syllabus<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:01.600> guy<00:05:01.870> in

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
questions per your syllabus that guy in

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.000 
questions per your syllabus that guy in
the<00:05:02.560> corner

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
the corner

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.830 
the corner
is<00:05:03.220> really<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.880> reason<00:05:04.210> we're<00:05:04.360> looking<00:05:04.720> at

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
is really the reason we're looking at

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.720 
is really the reason we're looking at
microscopes<00:05:05.380> now<00:05:05.620> he's<00:05:06.280> probably<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.670> the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
microscopes now he's probably in the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.360 
microscopes now he's probably in the
1600s<00:05:07.540> they<00:05:07.690> really<00:05:08.020> fine-tuned<00:05:08.650> the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
1600s they really fine-tuned the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.220 
1600s they really fine-tuned the
microscope<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.030> was<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.240> first<00:05:10.570> one<00:05:10.900> to

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
microscope and was the first one to

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.310 
microscope and was the first one to
really<00:05:11.590> observe<00:05:12.420> unicellular<00:05:14.940> organisms<00:05:15.940> and

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
really observe unicellular organisms and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.100 
really observe unicellular organisms and
so<00:05:17.320> Antoine<00:05:18.130> van<00:05:18.400> leeuwen<00:05:18.760> hook<00:05:19.110> you're

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
so Antoine van leeuwen hook you're

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.100 
so Antoine van leeuwen hook you're
welcome<00:05:20.500> we're<00:05:20.950> still<00:05:21.250> doing<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:22.350> okay<00:05:23.640> so<00:05:25.110> one

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
welcome we're still doing it okay so one

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.160 
welcome we're still doing it okay so one
last<00:05:26.290> thing<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:27.180> we<00:05:28.180> have<00:05:28.360> really<00:05:28.840> started<00:05:29.020> to

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
last thing is we have really started to

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.530 
last thing is we have really started to
incorporate<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.830> iPad<00:05:30.280> into<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:30.940> lot<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.240> these

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
incorporate the iPad into a lot of these

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.170 
incorporate the iPad into a lot of these
slides<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.950> so<00:05:33.130> you'll<00:05:33.280> see<00:05:33.520> us<00:05:33.700> kind<00:05:34.120> of

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
slides and so you'll see us kind of

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.970 
slides and so you'll see us kind of
reference<00:05:34.630> their<00:05:34.870> applications<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:37.980> it's

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
reference their applications and it's

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.910 
reference their applications and it's
really<00:05:39.370> what<00:05:39.610> you're<00:05:39.730> looking<00:05:39.760> at<00:05:40.150> our<00:05:40.920> images

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
really what you're looking at our images

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.470 
really what you're looking at our images
that<00:05:42.070> are<00:05:42.160> taken<00:05:42.340> with<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:42.790> microscope<00:05:43.210> or

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
that are taken with the microscope or

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.130 
that are taken with the microscope or
digital<00:05:43.900> microscope<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:45.220> magnification

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
digital microscope and the magnification

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.380 
digital microscope and the magnification
basically<00:05:47.140> ranges<00:05:47.560> from<00:05:47.880> 40<00:05:48.880> at<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:50.100> unzoom

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
basically ranges from 40 at the unzoom

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.560 
basically ranges from 40 at the unzoom
view<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.900> 200x<00:05:53.770> magnification<00:05:54.210> okay<00:05:55.210> and<00:05:55.420> so

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
view to 200x magnification okay and so

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.360 
view to 200x magnification okay and so
some<00:05:55.990> of<00:05:56.080> you<00:05:56.200> got<00:05:56.350> a<00:05:56.380> DVD<00:05:56.710> with<00:05:57.070> your<00:05:57.250> lab

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
some of you got a DVD with your lab

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.140 
some of you got a DVD with your lab
manual<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.120> also<00:05:58.660> matches<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.880> same

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
manual and that also matches the same

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.120 
manual and that also matches the same
images<00:06:01.660> so<00:06:01.840> these<00:06:02.080> images<00:06:02.410> every<00:06:02.890> image<00:06:03.100> that

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
images so these images every image that

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.030 
images so these images every image that
you<00:06:03.370> see<00:06:03.580> right<00:06:03.790> now<00:06:03.850> is<00:06:04.000> or<00:06:04.750> you<00:06:04.960> see<00:06:05.260> on<00:06:05.800> your

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
you see right now is or you see on your

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.070 
you see right now is or you see on your
DVD<00:06:06.310> or<00:06:06.520> you<00:06:06.610> see<00:06:06.820> in<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.000> iPad<00:06:07.420> or<00:06:07.660> imp<00:06:07.840> or

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
DVD or you see in the iPad or imp or

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.010 
DVD or you see in the iPad or imp or
from<00:06:08.500> slides<00:06:08.920> in<00:06:09.280> class<00:06:09.700> and<00:06:10.390> so<00:06:10.750> when<00:06:10.900> you're

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
from slides in class and so when you're

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.170 
from slides in class and so when you're
labeling<00:06:11.530> it<00:06:11.680> you<00:06:12.460> if<00:06:12.820> you<00:06:12.940> were<00:06:13.030> looking

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
labeling it you if you were looking

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.490 
labeling it you if you were looking
through<00:06:13.450> a<00:06:13.480> microscope<00:06:13.630> or<00:06:14.110> you're<00:06:14.260> drawing

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
through a microscope or you're drawing

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.480 
through a microscope or you're drawing
it<00:06:14.680> through<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.860> microscope

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
it through a microscope

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.830 
it through a microscope
you're<00:06:15.700> gonna<00:06:15.790> label<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.270> name<00:06:16.390> of<00:06:16.540> the<00:06:16.600> slide

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
you're gonna label the name of the slide

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.870 
you're gonna label the name of the slide
or<00:06:17.260> the<00:06:17.380> tissue<00:06:17.590> and<00:06:18.100> you<00:06:18.370> can<00:06:18.490> tell<00:06:18.730> me<00:06:18.850> the

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
or the tissue and you can tell me the

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.910 
or the tissue and you can tell me the
magnification<00:06:19.690> that's<00:06:19.870> associated<00:06:20.260> with<00:06:20.620> it

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
magnification that's associated with it

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.770 
magnification that's associated with it
and<00:06:21.340> for<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.610> iPad<00:06:21.970> it's<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.270> little<00:06:22.600> less

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
and for the iPad it's a little less

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.800 
and for the iPad it's a little less
clear<00:06:22.810> so<00:06:23.410> it's<00:06:23.710> okay<00:06:24.100> to<00:06:24.700> put<00:06:24.970> iPad

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
clear so it's okay to put iPad

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.770 
clear so it's okay to put iPad
magnification<00:06:26.740> or<00:06:27.010> if<00:06:27.340> you<00:06:27.460> want<00:06:27.640> to<00:06:27.700> say<00:06:27.850> 200x

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
magnification or if you want to say 200x

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.920 
magnification or if you want to say 200x
magnification<00:06:29.910> that's<00:06:30.910> also<00:06:31.270> acceptable<00:06:31.540> if

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
magnification that's also acceptable if

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.760 
magnification that's also acceptable if
it's<00:06:32.080> zoomed<00:06:32.290> in<00:06:32.500> all<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.740> way<00:06:33.960> so<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.500> take

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
it's zoomed in all the way so the take

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.480 
it's zoomed in all the way so the take
away<00:06:35.800> things<00:06:36.370> that<00:06:36.700> you<00:06:37.390> can<00:06:38.040> build<00:06:39.040> off<00:06:39.220> from

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
away things that you can build off from

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.840 
away things that you can build off from
this

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
this

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.240 
this
lecture<00:06:40.570> are<00:06:41.500> that<00:06:41.680> you<00:06:41.800> should<00:06:41.980> be<00:06:42.070> able<00:06:42.130> to

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
lecture are that you should be able to

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.640 
lecture are that you should be able to
identify<00:06:42.340> and<00:06:43.060> get<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:43.810> basic<00:06:43.990> function<00:06:44.560> of

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
identify and get the basic function of

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.050 
identify and get the basic function of
the<00:06:44.770> major<00:06:44.920> structures<00:06:45.370> on<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.550> microscope

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
the major structures on the microscope

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.720 
the major structures on the microscope
and<00:06:46.720> you<00:06:46.840> should<00:06:47.080> know<00:06:47.200> how<00:06:47.290> to<00:06:47.410> calculate

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
and you should know how to calculate

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.000 
and you should know how to calculate
magnification<00:06:48.730> all<00:06:49.420> right<00:06:49.540> so<00:06:49.870> if<00:06:50.830> you're

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
magnification all right so if you're

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.760 
magnification all right so if you're
looking<00:06:51.130> under<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:52.120> scanning<00:06:52.780> lens<00:06:53.080> which<00:06:53.590> is

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
looking under the scanning lens which is

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.890 
looking under the scanning lens which is
the<00:06:53.920> 4x<00:06:55.290> optiforce<00:06:57.030> magnification<00:06:58.030> and<00:06:58.330> then

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
the 4x optiforce magnification and then

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.860 
the 4x optiforce magnification and then
also<00:06:59.370> you<00:07:00.370> should<00:07:00.550> know<00:07:00.730> what<00:07:01.420> happens<00:07:01.750> when

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
also you should know what happens when

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.510 
also you should know what happens when
you<00:07:02.050> change<00:07:02.320> your<00:07:02.470> field<00:07:02.650> of<00:07:02.740> view<00:07:02.860> so<00:07:03.160> if<00:07:03.400> you

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
you change your field of view so if you

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.180 
you change your field of view so if you
zoom<00:07:03.760> out<00:07:03.940> you<00:07:04.300> lower<00:07:04.510> the<00:07:04.690> magnification<00:07:05.190> you

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
zoom out you lower the magnification you

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
zoom out you lower the magnification you
are<00:07:06.490> increasing<00:07:07.390> your<00:07:07.690> field<00:07:07.990> of<00:07:08.080> view
