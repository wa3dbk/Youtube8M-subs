I<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.550> make<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.390> special

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
I want to make sure we get the special

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.660 
I want to make sure we get the special
stage<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.440> see<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.650> there's<00:01:52.770> any<00:01:52.890> difference<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
stage to see if there's any difference I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.120 
stage to see if there's any difference I
don't<00:01:54.660> think<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.080> will<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
don't think there will be because it is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.680 
don't think there will be because it is
the<00:01:56.369> sonic<00:01:56.670> clone<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.910> Kirby<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.510> don't

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
the sonic clone of Kirby and it I don't

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.240 
the sonic clone of Kirby and it I don't
think<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.290> means<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> special<00:01:59.040> stages

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
think that means that the special stages

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
think that means that the special stages
will<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.460> changed<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.510> I'm<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.690> going<00:02:00.900> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
will be changed but I'm just going to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.620 
will be changed but I'm just going to
check<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.410> I<00:02:01.590> usually<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.510> let's<00:02:03.510> get

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
check because I usually do let's get

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.780 

-<00:02:15.209> no<00:02:15.300> business<00:02:15.480> me<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> music<00:02:16.410> seems

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
- no business me but the music seems

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
- no business me but the music seems
slightly<00:02:17.790> different<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.660> don't<00:02:19.080> know<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.620> think

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
slightly different I don't know I think

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.360 
slightly different I don't know I think
I'm<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.459> might<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.730> imagining<00:02:21.090> things

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
I'm just I might be imagining things

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.180 
I'm just I might be imagining things
special<00:02:23.370> stage<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.820> no<00:02:24.300> different<00:02:25.010> same<00:02:26.010> thing

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
special stage is no different same thing

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.190 
special stage is no different same thing
yeah<00:02:29.190> same<00:02:29.670> thing<00:02:29.700> okay<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.300> second<00:02:30.870> spec<00:02:31.080> I've

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
yeah same thing okay I second spec I've

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.420 
yeah same thing okay I second spec I've
always<00:02:31.410> stood<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> sunny<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.130> special

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
always stood for the sunny one special

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
always stood for the sunny one special
stages<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.239> hate<00:02:33.450> them<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.780> can't<00:02:34.020> do

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
stages that I just hate them I can't do

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.370 
stages that I just hate them I can't do
them<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.560> don't<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.160> don't<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.750> can't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
them I don't know I don't know I can't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.250 
them I don't know I don't know I can't
do<00:02:37.470> them<00:02:38.630> sometimes<00:02:39.630> are<00:02:39.780> two<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.110> three

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
do them sometimes are two and three

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.289 
do them sometimes are two and three
special<00:02:40.680> stages<00:02:40.860> away<00:02:41.160> but<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.790> saw<00:02:42.239> like

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
special stages away but I just saw like

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.410 
special stages away but I just saw like
one<00:02:42.600> special<00:02:43.080> stage<00:02:43.260> yeah<00:02:43.790> yeah<00:02:44.790> they're<00:02:45.299> make

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
one special stage yeah yeah they're make

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.870 
one special stage yeah yeah they're make
no<00:02:45.570> sense<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.110> OH

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
no sense is a OH

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.830 
no sense is a OH
so<00:02:47.880> apparently<00:02:48.120> when<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.690> double

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
so apparently when you do the double

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.150 
so apparently when you do the double
jump<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.440> can't<00:02:49.709> hurt<00:02:50.430> anything<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:52.739> you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
jump you can't hurt anything but you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340 
jump you can't hurt anything but you
know<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.549> not<00:02:53.670> much<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.360> makes<00:02:54.900> sense<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
know it's not much of a it makes sense I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.770 
know it's not much of a it makes sense I
suppose<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.010> could<00:02:56.160> stop<00:02:56.370> spinning

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
suppose because you could stop spinning

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.759 
suppose because you could stop spinning
it<00:02:57.780> doesn't<00:02:58.019> make<00:02:58.110> sense<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:58.380> him<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:58.709> able

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
it doesn't make sense for him to be able

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.770 
it doesn't make sense for him to be able
to<00:02:58.920> jump<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.220> them<00:02:59.340> guess<00:02:59.580> but

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
to jump on them guess but

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.690 
to jump on them guess but
I<00:03:01.810> guess<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.830> premise<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.400> Sonic<00:03:03.670> game

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
I guess for the premise of a Sonic game

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.360 
I guess for the premise of a Sonic game
it<00:03:03.940> makes<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:05.170> wouldn't<00:03:05.590> really<00:03:05.740> work<00:03:05.830> if

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
it makes it it wouldn't really work if

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.720 
it makes it it wouldn't really work if
you<00:03:06.490> like<00:03:06.640> Amy<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.780> sonic<00:03:08.170> advance

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
you like Amy and sonic advance

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.460 
you like Amy and sonic advance
you<00:03:09.730> couldn't<00:03:10.000> have<00:03:10.090> enemies<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:11.170> any<00:03:11.350> of

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
you couldn't have enemies and if any of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.270 
you couldn't have enemies and if any of
you<00:03:11.560> remember<00:03:11.650> Amy<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.430> sonic<00:03:12.640> advance

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
you remember Amy and sonic advance

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.010 
you remember Amy and sonic advance
she<00:03:15.280> was<00:03:15.430> pretty<00:03:15.670> terrible<00:03:16.000> unless<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> were

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
she was pretty terrible unless you were

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.590 
she was pretty terrible unless you were
I<00:03:17.260> said<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.160> think<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.580> Sonic<00:03:18.850> Advance<00:03:19.000> 3<00:03:19.360> could

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
I said I think in Sonic Advance 3 could

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.740 
I said I think in Sonic Advance 3 could
team<00:03:19.780> up<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:20.020> Sonic<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.860> then<00:03:21.010> get<00:03:21.340> oh<00:03:21.750> my
