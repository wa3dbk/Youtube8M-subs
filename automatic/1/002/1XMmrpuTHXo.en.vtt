00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
this is the single strand diamond not as

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.279 
this is the single strand diamond not as
I<00:00:11.280> know<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.639> some<00:00:12.540> folks<00:00:12.830> refer<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
I know it some folks refer to it as the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.320 
I know it some folks refer to it as the
friendship<00:00:16.289> knots<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.210> various<00:00:18.210> other<00:00:18.470> names

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
friendship knots and various other names

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.040 
friendship knots and various other names
there<00:00:21.330> aren't<00:00:21.510> many<00:00:23.269> verbal<00:00:24.269> instructions<00:00:24.869> on

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
there aren't many verbal instructions on

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.800 
there aren't many verbal instructions on
this<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.859> really<00:00:25.890> need<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.699> watch<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
this one you really need to watch the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.310 
this one you really need to watch the
video<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.619> how<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.580> done<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> lot

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
video to see how it's done I know a lot

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.590 
video to see how it's done I know a lot
of<00:00:31.349> people<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.219> tie<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.000> around<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
of people like to tie this around the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.979 
of people like to tie this around the
hand<00:00:33.920> but<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.280> prefer<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:37.010> start<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> knot<00:00:38.309> off

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
hand but I prefer to start the knot off

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.310 
hand but I prefer to start the knot off
basically<00:00:39.989> flat<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.760> work<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.320> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
basically flat and work from there so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.690 
basically flat and work from there so
watch<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.460> video<00:00:44.579> closely<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.039> hopefully<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
watch the video closely and hopefully it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:06.140 
watch the video closely and hopefully it
will<00:00:47.940> help<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:48.989> folks

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.510 

now<00:01:07.050> because<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.610> single<00:01:09.420> strand<00:01:10.400> when<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
now because it's a single strand when it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.430 
now because it's a single strand when it
comes<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.910> tightening<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.170> can't

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
comes to tightening up you really can't

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.210 
comes to tightening up you really can't
go<00:01:13.830> too<00:01:14.370> far<00:01:14.610> wrong<00:01:15.140> because<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
go too far wrong because you're not

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.400 
go too far wrong because you're not
gonna<00:01:17.370> interfere<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.540> strands<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
gonna interfere with other strands and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.970 
gonna interfere with other strands and
with<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.240> already<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
with this one you can see already that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.010 
with this one you can see already that
the<00:01:22.980> loop<00:01:23.160> at<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> top<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.910> knot<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.540> quite

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the loop at the top of the knot is quite

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
the loop at the top of the knot is quite
big<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.820> fiddle<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
big but you can fiddle about with this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.290 
big but you can fiddle about with this
tighten<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:29.210> push<00:01:30.210> pull<00:01:30.750> tug<00:01:31.230> and<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:33.060> get

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
tighten it up push pull tug and you get

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.570 
tighten it up push pull tug and you get
it<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.870> want

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.130 

there<00:01:41.580> we<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.240> quite<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.660> big<00:01:42.900> loop

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
there we go that that's quite a big loop

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130 
there we go that that's quite a big loop
at<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.350> top<00:01:43.700> probably<00:01:44.700> bigger<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.140> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
at the top probably bigger than you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.730 
at the top probably bigger than you
would<00:01:46.260> need<00:01:46.410> for<00:01:46.680> most<00:01:46.860> applications<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.740> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
would need for most applications but so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.320 
would need for most applications but so
what

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
what

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.920 
what
just<00:01:52.340> pull<00:01:53.340> through<00:01:54.320> tight<00:01:55.320> nope<00:01:56.570> move<00:01:57.570> around

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
just pull through tight nope move around

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
just pull through tight nope move around
and<00:02:00.530> fiddle<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> until<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.160> get<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> how

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and fiddle with it until you get it how

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719 
and fiddle with it until you get it how
you<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.720> because<00:02:04.680> there's<00:02:04.860> only<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.280> strand

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you want because there's only one strand

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:15.610 
you want because there's only one strand
it<00:02:06.300> really<00:02:06.780> doesn't<00:02:07.110> matter

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.680 

you
