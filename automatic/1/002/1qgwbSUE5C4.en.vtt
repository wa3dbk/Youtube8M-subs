the server the more lag you will get

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.260 
the server the more lag you will get
just<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.360> there's<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.929> man

alright<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.050> looks<00:02:14.200> like<00:02:14.260> each<00:02:14.500> server<00:02:15.160> has

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
alright so it looks like each server has

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.440 
alright so it looks like each server has
about<00:02:16.090> seven<00:02:16.480> hundred<00:02:16.570> nine<00:02:16.990> megabytes<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.830> UM

about seven hundred nine megabytes to UM

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.540 
about seven hundred nine megabytes to UM
the<00:02:19.450> server<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.930> my<00:02:20.380> TPS<00:02:20.920> right<00:02:21.130> now<00:02:21.280> is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
the server and my TPS right now is

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.130 
the server and my TPS right now is
sixteen<00:02:22.060> point<00:02:22.090> seven<00:02:22.420> eight<00:02:22.600> which<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.810> not

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
sixteen point seven eight which is not

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.960 
sixteen point seven eight which is not
too<00:02:23.440> bad<00:02:23.620> consuming<00:02:24.130> there<00:02:24.220> are<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> lot<00:02:24.850> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
too bad consuming there are a lot of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.130 
too bad consuming there are a lot of
other<00:02:25.090> people<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.510> right<00:02:25.630> now<00:02:25.750> I'm<00:02:25.870> on<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.050> of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
other people on right now I'm on out of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.860 
other people on right now I'm on out of
the<00:02:26.200> peak<00:02:26.410> time<00:02:26.710> so<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.300> still<00:02:28.510> pretty<00:02:28.720> good

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
the peak time so it's still pretty good

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
the peak time so it's still pretty good
like<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.290> still<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.950> know<00:02:30.070> mine<00:02:30.370> block<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
like I can still you know mine block and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.620 
like I can still you know mine block and
whatnot

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630

hit<00:02:31.870> hit<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.530> there's<00:02:32.710> really<00:02:33.490> no<00:02:33.820> lag<00:02:34.060> you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
hit hit and there's really no lag you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.720 
hit hit and there's really no lag you
won't<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.570> any<00:02:34.690> lag<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.710> also<00:02:35.920> utilizes<00:02:36.220> I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
won't see any lag it also utilizes I

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.570 
won't see any lag it also utilizes I
guess<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.300> world<00:02:37.780> border<00:02:38.260> feature<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.520> I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
guess the world border feature here so I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.300 
guess the world border feature here so I
can't<00:02:39.790> really<00:02:40.000> go<00:02:40.290> everywhere<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.620> can't<00:02:42.190> get

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
can't really go everywhere I can't get
