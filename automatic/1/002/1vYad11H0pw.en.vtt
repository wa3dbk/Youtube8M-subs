00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.570 

we've<00:00:03.139> talked<00:00:03.440> about<00:00:03.560> voltage<00:00:04.069> drop<00:00:04.370> we've

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
we've talked about voltage drop we've

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.010 
we've talked about voltage drop we've
talked<00:00:04.790> about<00:00:04.880> how<00:00:05.060> to<00:00:05.090> use<00:00:05.300> our<00:00:05.510> meter<00:00:05.810> as<00:00:05.990> a

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
talked about how to use our meter as a

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.420 
talked about how to use our meter as a
kind<00:00:06.290> of<00:00:06.350> a<00:00:06.440> frontage<00:00:06.830> robe<00:00:07.100> to<00:00:07.220> give<00:00:07.339> you

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
kind of a frontage robe to give you

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.920 
kind of a frontage robe to give you
electricity<00:00:07.609> someplace<00:00:08.240> else<00:00:08.420> to<00:00:08.540> go

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
electricity someplace else to go

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.840 
electricity someplace else to go
we'd<00:00:09.530> like<00:00:09.680> to<00:00:09.799> do<00:00:09.949> in<00:00:10.100> this<00:00:10.190> last<00:00:10.430> video<00:00:10.610> on

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
we'd like to do in this last video on

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.269 
we'd like to do in this last video on
voltage<00:00:11.299> drop<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.110> show<00:00:12.379> you<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.590> practical

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:13.279 
voltage drop you show you a practical

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.390 
voltage drop you show you a practical
way<00:00:13.580> of<00:00:14.029> how<00:00:14.180> they<00:00:14.389> actually<00:00:14.510> use<00:00:14.900> this<00:00:15.400> I've

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
way of how they actually use this I've

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.010 
way of how they actually use this I've
simulated<00:00:16.730> a<00:00:17.090> battery<00:00:17.480> with<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.720> cable

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
simulated a battery with the cable

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.840 
simulated a battery with the cable
running<00:00:18.170> to<00:00:18.290> the<00:00:18.440> starter<00:00:18.800> let's<00:00:19.490> assume<00:00:19.730> you

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
running to the starter let's assume you

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.580 
running to the starter let's assume you
start<00:00:20.090> her<00:00:20.150> as<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.300> train<00:00:20.480> fast<00:00:20.750> enough<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.230> you

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
start her as a train fast enough and you

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.720 
start her as a train fast enough and you
figure<00:00:21.860> well<00:00:22.160> maybe<00:00:22.370> I've<00:00:22.460> got<00:00:22.520> a<00:00:22.580> problem

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
figure well maybe I've got a problem

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.570 
figure well maybe I've got a problem
with<00:00:22.880> my<00:00:23.000> cable<00:00:23.210> it's<00:00:23.750> a<00:00:23.810> logical<00:00:23.990> conclusion

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
with my cable it's a logical conclusion

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.160 
with my cable it's a logical conclusion
you<00:00:25.580> get<00:00:25.730> your<00:00:25.880> volt<00:00:26.030> meter<00:00:26.210> set<00:00:26.930> your<00:00:27.050> whole

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
you get your volt meter set your whole

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.420 
you get your volt meter set your whole
meter<00:00:27.350> to<00:00:27.470> volts<00:00:27.740> as<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:27.920> normally<00:00:28.039> would

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
meter to volts as you normally would

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.799 
meter to volts as you normally would
get<00:00:29.420> your<00:00:29.630> two<00:00:29.720> terminals<00:00:30.200> this<00:00:31.100> is<00:00:31.250> important

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
get your two terminals this is important

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.900 
get your two terminals this is important
put<00:00:32.809> one<00:00:33.079> to<00:00:33.320> touch<00:00:33.560> the<00:00:33.890> post<00:00:34.250> coming<00:00:34.730> out<00:00:34.820> of

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
put one to touch the post coming out of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.910 
put one to touch the post coming out of
the<00:00:35.000> battery<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.570> this<00:00:35.720> side<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.320> want<00:00:36.860> to

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
the battery on this side and want to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.890 
the battery on this side and want to
touch<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.310> post<00:00:37.730> going<00:00:38.180> into<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.510> starter

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
touch the post going into the starter

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.440 
touch the post going into the starter
here<00:00:39.170> have<00:00:40.100> somebody<00:00:40.520> crank<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.910> internet<00:00:41.360> we

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
here have somebody crank the internet we

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.700 
here have somebody crank the internet we
have<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.720> have<00:00:41.840> electricity<00:00:42.170> flowing<00:00:42.530> under

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
have to have electricity flowing under

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.680 
have to have electricity flowing under
this<00:00:42.829> won't<00:00:43.010> work<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:43.430> they<00:00:43.970> crank<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.360> engine

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
this won't work so they crank the engine

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.280 
this won't work so they crank the engine
now<00:00:45.410> with<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.160> other<00:00:46.280> systems<00:00:46.760> in<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.000> car

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
now with the other systems in the car

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.810 
now with the other systems in the car
one-half<00:00:48.290> of<00:00:48.470> one<00:00:48.739> volt<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.190> about<00:00:49.430> as<00:00:49.520> much<00:00:49.670> as

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
one-half of one volt is about as much as

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.670 
one-half of one volt is about as much as
we<00:00:49.940> want<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.239> see<00:00:50.420> through<00:00:50.630> this<00:00:50.750> meter<00:00:51.050> we've

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
we want to see through this meter we've

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.229 
we want to see through this meter we've
got<00:00:51.770> a<00:00:51.800> lot<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.160> electricity<00:00:52.820> going<00:00:53.090> through

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
got a lot of electricity going through

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.330 
got a lot of electricity going through
here<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.079> in<00:00:54.200> this<00:00:54.320> particular<00:00:54.500> case<00:00:54.800> she<00:00:55.219> can

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
here so in this particular case she can

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.740 
here so in this particular case she can
get<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.460> lift<00:00:55.700> it<00:00:55.790> pretty<00:00:55.940> close<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.270> one<00:00:56.480> volt

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
get a lift it pretty close to one volt

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.350 
get a lift it pretty close to one volt
and<00:00:56.989> still<00:00:57.500> be<00:00:57.620> acceptable<00:00:58.130> so<00:00:58.940> let's<00:00:59.120> say<00:00:59.239> we

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
and still be acceptable so let's say we

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.540 
and still be acceptable so let's say we
run<00:00:59.510> our<00:00:59.660> test<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.829> we've<00:01:01.040> touched<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
run our test and we've touched the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.400 
run our test and we've touched the
terminal<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.059> post<00:01:02.420> here<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.780> post<00:01:03.020> here<00:01:03.290> and

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
terminal the post here the post here and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.899 
terminal the post here the post here and
we're<00:01:03.500> getting<00:01:03.739> maybe<00:01:03.920> four<00:01:04.219> volts<00:01:04.610> trying<00:01:04.850> to

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
we're getting maybe four volts trying to

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.520 
we're getting maybe four volts trying to
grow<00:01:05.030> through<00:01:05.239> our<00:01:05.299> meter<00:01:05.479> something's<00:01:06.289> wrong

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
grow through our meter something's wrong

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.639 
grow through our meter something's wrong
now<00:01:07.310> what's<00:01:07.999> wrong<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:09.229> have<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.439> break<00:01:09.590> it

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
now what's wrong you have to break it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:10.120 
now what's wrong you have to break it
down

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
down

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.739 
down
you<00:01:10.399> can't<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:10.850> say<00:01:11.030> it's<00:01:11.209> the<00:01:11.359> cable

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749 
you can't just say it's the cable

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:14.169 
you can't just say it's the cable
because<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.170> might<00:01:12.319> not<00:01:12.350> be<00:01:12.759> first<00:01:13.759> test<00:01:14.030> to

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
because it might not be first test to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.969 
because it might not be first test to
run<00:01:14.270> after<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.659> take<00:01:15.319> one<00:01:15.560> lead<00:01:15.740> from<00:01:15.889> your

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
run after that take one lead from your

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.249 
run after that take one lead from your
volt<00:01:16.189> meter<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.429> touch<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.939> cable<00:01:17.389> end<00:01:17.539> take

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
volt meter and touch the cable end take

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.510 
volt meter and touch the cable end take
the<00:01:18.289> other<00:01:18.560> leaf<00:01:18.799> from<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:18.979> voltmeter<00:01:19.249> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
the other leaf from the voltmeter and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.550 
the other leaf from the voltmeter and
touch<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.909> post<00:01:20.119> in<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.420> battery<00:01:20.719> have

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
touch the post in the battery have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.739 
touch the post in the battery have
somebody<00:01:21.950> crank<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.340> car<00:01:22.549> okay<00:01:23.450> if<00:01:23.659> the

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
somebody crank the car okay if the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.330 
somebody crank the car okay if the
voltage<00:01:24.079> is<00:01:24.439> trying<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.009> get<00:01:25.130> through<00:01:25.249> the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
voltage is trying to get through the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.319 
voltage is trying to get through the
meter<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.639> very<00:01:25.670> low

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
meter is very low

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.029 
meter is very low
we<00:01:26.659> know<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:26.959> the<00:01:27.079> connection<00:01:27.560> between<00:01:27.709> the

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
we know that the connection between the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.819 
we know that the connection between the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
cable end and the post is good if right

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.800 
cable end and the post is good if right
here<00:01:31.310> we're<00:01:31.670> getting<00:01:31.880> three<00:01:32.179> or<00:01:32.299> four<00:01:32.479> volts

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
here we're getting three or four volts

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.910 
here we're getting three or four volts
or<00:01:32.899> 5<00:01:32.929> volts<00:01:33.049> trying<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.499> climb<00:01:33.649> through<00:01:33.859> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
or 5 volts trying to climb through the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.830 
or 5 volts trying to climb through the
meter<00:01:34.099> that<00:01:34.609> we<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.119> we<00:01:35.240> have<00:01:35.389> a<00:01:35.420> problem

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
meter that we have is we have a problem

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.779 
meter that we have is we have a problem
between<00:01:35.959> the<00:01:36.289> cable<00:01:36.619> end<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.279> post

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
between the cable end and the post

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.059 
between the cable end and the post
it's<00:01:38.060> probably<00:01:38.359> just<00:01:38.420> dirty<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:39.709> next<00:01:39.950> thing

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
it's probably just dirty the next thing

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:41.830 
it's probably just dirty the next thing
we<00:01:40.130> want<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.340> do<00:01:40.459> is<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:40.969> cable<00:01:41.299> end<00:01:41.420> again

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
we want to do is the cable end again

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.319 
we want to do is the cable end again
pierce<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.619> vinyl<00:01:43.039> on<00:01:43.069> the<00:01:43.130> cable<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.090> have

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
pierce the vinyl on the cable and have

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.149 
pierce the vinyl on the cable and have
somebody<00:01:44.479> crank<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.959> engine<00:01:45.319> see<00:01:45.829> what<00:01:45.979> kind

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
somebody crank the engine see what kind

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.889 
somebody crank the engine see what kind
of<00:01:46.189> voltage<00:01:46.310> tries<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.880> run<00:01:47.029> through<00:01:47.270> if<00:01:47.509> it's

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
of voltage tries to run through if it's

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.319 
of voltage tries to run through if it's
good<00:01:48.139> we're<00:01:48.619> fine<00:01:48.950> if<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.549> voltage<00:01:49.729> begins<00:01:50.209> to

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
good we're fine if the voltage begins to

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.550 
good we're fine if the voltage begins to
climb<00:01:50.509> through<00:01:50.749> the<00:01:50.840> meter<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.259> means<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
climb through the meter that means the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.809 
climb through the meter that means the
connection<00:01:51.979> between<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.279> cable<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.700> the

connection between the cable and the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.510 
connection between the cable and the
cable<00:01:52.849> needs<00:01:53.509> attention<00:01:54.009> down<00:01:55.009> here<00:01:55.310> we'll<00:01:55.429> do

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
cable needs attention down here we'll do

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.159 
cable needs attention down here we'll do
the<00:01:55.639> exact<00:01:55.939> same<00:01:56.179> thing<00:01:56.479> we<00:01:56.899> poked<00:01:57.139> through

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:57.169 
the exact same thing we poked through

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:59.260 
the exact same thing we poked through
the<00:01:57.439> vinyl<00:01:57.679> we<00:01:58.009> touch<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.369> cable<00:01:58.549> end<00:01:58.849> have

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the vinyl we touch the cable end have

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.580 
the vinyl we touch the cable end have
somebody<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.599> crank<00:01:59.779> the<00:01:59.899> engine<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.409> take<00:02:00.529> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
somebody to crank the engine and take a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.440 
somebody to crank the engine and take a
reading<00:02:00.829> if<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:01.549> good<00:02:01.729> great<00:02:02.060> if<00:02:02.239> it's<00:02:02.389> not

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
reading if it's good great if it's not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.849 
reading if it's good great if it's not
where<00:02:02.749> the<00:02:02.840> cable<00:02:03.109> needs<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.380> cable<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:03.799> is

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
where the cable needs the cable and is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.379 
where the cable needs the cable and is
their<00:02:03.979> problem<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.429> then<00:02:04.939> we<00:02:04.999> go<00:02:05.119> from<00:02:05.239> the

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
their problem and then we go from the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.239 
their problem and then we go from the
post<00:02:05.630> going<00:02:06.200> into<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.409> starter<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:06.859> the

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
post going into the starter and the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.999 
post going into the starter and the
cable<00:02:07.609> end<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.939> run<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.209> test<00:02:08.420> again<00:02:08.539> ok<00:02:09.470> this

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
cable end and run the test again ok this

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.140 
cable end and run the test again ok this
will<00:02:10.190> not<00:02:10.399> only<00:02:10.430> tell<00:02:10.729> us<00:02:10.820> if<00:02:10.940> we<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.120> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
will not only tell us if we have a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.670 
will not only tell us if we have a
problem<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.720> big<00:02:11.930> picture<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:12.500> then<00:02:12.620> it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
problem in the big picture but then it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.830 
problem in the big picture but then it
will<00:02:12.770> help<00:02:12.890> us<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.100> break<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.550> down<00:02:13.760> by<00:02:14.510> doing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
will help us to break it down by doing

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.320 
will help us to break it down by doing
that<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.110> can

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
that you can
