00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
verizon wireless as you might have

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.380 
verizon wireless as you might have
guessed<00:00:15.309> this<00:00:15.700> is<00:00:15.880> the<00:00:16.029> long-awaited

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
guessed this is the long-awaited

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.840 
guessed this is the long-awaited
successor<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.590> first<00:00:17.949> blackberry<00:00:18.520> storm

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
successor to the first blackberry storm

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.540 
successor to the first blackberry storm
which<00:00:19.480> wasn't<00:00:19.720> exactly<00:00:20.199> access<00:00:20.949> to<00:00:21.189> do<00:00:21.310> all

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
which wasn't exactly access to do all

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.670 
which wasn't exactly access to do all
the<00:00:21.670> bugs<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:21.970> performance<00:00:22.449> issues<00:00:22.810> there

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
the bugs and performance issues there

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.200 
the bugs and performance issues there
were<00:00:23.800> software<00:00:24.310> updates<00:00:24.640> that<00:00:24.850> fixed<00:00:25.150> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
were software updates that fixed a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.640 
were software updates that fixed a
number<00:00:25.480> of<00:00:25.539> the<00:00:25.630> problems<00:00:26.019> but<00:00:26.170> still<00:00:26.380> that's

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
number of the problems but still that's

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.500 
number of the problems but still that's
not<00:00:26.769> really<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.250> good<00:00:27.730> way<00:00:27.880> to<00:00:27.910> leave<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.240> good

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
not really a good way to leave a good

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.630 
not really a good way to leave a good
impression<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:29.019> there's<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.039> lot<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.189> questions

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
impression so there's a lot of questions

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.280 
impression so there's a lot of questions
about<00:00:30.880> whether<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.390> storm<00:00:31.660> two<00:00:31.900> will<00:00:32.169> be

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
about whether the storm two will be

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.229 
about whether the storm two will be
better<00:00:32.469> and<00:00:32.829> for<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.250> most<00:00:33.430> part<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:33.790> is<00:00:33.910> but

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
better and for the most part it is but

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.060 
better and for the most part it is but
there<00:00:34.450> are<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.600> couple<00:00:34.960> issues<00:00:35.290> that<00:00:35.710> worry<00:00:35.980> me

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
there are a couple issues that worry me

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.639 
there are a couple issues that worry me
which<00:00:36.790> I'll<00:00:36.910> talk<00:00:37.030> about<00:00:37.090> later<00:00:37.469> first<00:00:38.469> let's

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
which I'll talk about later first let's

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.490 
which I'll talk about later first let's
take<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.920> look<00:00:39.340> at<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.579> design<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.120> phone

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
take a look at the design of the phone

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.930 
take a look at the design of the phone
just<00:00:41.500> at<00:00:41.710> a<00:00:41.739> glance<00:00:41.890> there's<00:00:42.280> really<00:00:42.460> no<00:00:42.670> major

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
just at a glance there's really no major

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.459 
just at a glance there's really no major
differences<00:00:43.210> between<00:00:43.780> this<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.200> the

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
differences between this and the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.350 
differences between this and the
original<00:00:44.590> storm<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:45.460> they're<00:00:45.820> even<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.180> same

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
original storm and they're even the same

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.779 
original storm and they're even the same
size<00:00:46.710> however<00:00:47.710> what<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.010> can't<00:00:48.309> see<00:00:48.520> is<00:00:48.640> the

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
size however what you can't see is the

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.490 
size however what you can't see is the
new<00:00:48.940> short<00:00:49.239> press<00:00:49.480> technology<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.260> sits

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
new short press technology that sits

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.920 
new short press technology that sits
under<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:51.010> display<00:00:51.460> if<00:00:52.120> you<00:00:52.360> remember<00:00:52.690> on<00:00:52.809> the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
under the display if you remember on the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.270 
under the display if you remember on the
first<00:00:52.960> storm<00:00:53.379> there<00:00:53.590> was<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.739> mechanical

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
first storm there was a mechanical

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.189 
first storm there was a mechanical
suspension<00:00:54.940> system<00:00:55.329> underneath<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.930> screen

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
suspension system underneath the screen

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.510 
suspension system underneath the screen
that<00:00:56.500> created<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.920> click<00:00:57.129> when<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.399> were

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
that created a click when you were

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.279 
that created a click when you were
typing<00:00:57.730> or<00:00:58.030> opening<00:00:58.329> apps<00:00:58.539> and<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.960> display

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
typing or opening apps and the display

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.529 
typing or opening apps and the display
would<00:00:59.469> actually<00:00:59.800> press<00:01:00.010> down<00:01:00.270> well<00:01:01.270> on<00:01:01.390> the

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
would actually press down well on the

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.029 
would actually press down well on the
storm<00:01:01.780> two<00:01:02.020> rim<00:01:02.289> halves<00:01:02.440> replace<00:01:02.800> that

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
storm two rim halves replace that

suspension system with an electronic one
the<00:01:06.159> technology<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:06.760> really<00:01:06.880> neat<00:01:07.210> because<00:01:07.360> it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
the technology is really neat because it

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.760 
the technology is really neat because it
even<00:01:08.049> though<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.260> screen<00:01:08.500> doesn't

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
even though the screen doesn't

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.200 
even though the screen doesn't
physically<00:01:09.070> move<00:01:09.369> except<00:01:09.729> for<00:01:09.909> around<00:01:10.030> the

it<00:01:13.180> still<00:01:13.570> give<00:01:13.720> off<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:13.900> clicky<00:01:14.409> feel<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:14.799> it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
it still give off that clicky feel so it

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.200 
it still give off that clicky feel so it
seems<00:01:15.100> like<00:01:15.220> you're<00:01:15.340> pressing<00:01:15.580> an<00:01:15.850> actual

a<00:01:24.970> couple<00:01:25.119> advantages<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.140> electronic

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
a couple advantages to the electronic

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.649 
a couple advantages to the electronic
version<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.100> sure<00:01:27.310> pressed<00:01:27.640> first<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.479> don't

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
version of sure pressed first you don't

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.060 
version of sure pressed first you don't
have<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.049> apply<00:01:29.259> as<00:01:29.380> much<00:01:29.500> pressure<00:01:29.829> when

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
have to apply as much pressure when

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.859 
have to apply as much pressure when
typing<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.790> also<00:01:30.970> allows<00:01:31.270> for<00:01:31.270> key<00:01:31.720> roll

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
typing and it also allows for key roll

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.289 
typing and it also allows for key roll
over<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.409> multi-touch<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.670> for<00:01:33.850> example<00:01:33.880> if

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
over and multi-touch so for example if

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.730 
over and multi-touch so for example if
you<00:01:34.420> want<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.689> capitalize<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> letter<00:01:35.470> while
