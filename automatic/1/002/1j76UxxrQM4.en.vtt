walking around in here and you can see

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
walking around in here and you can see
that<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.960> those<00:01:25.080> signs<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:25.799> different

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that all of those signs were different

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
that all of those signs were different
worlds<00:01:26.580> people<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:26.909> advertising<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.720> the

finished<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.720> mostly<00:01:55.079> stable<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.070> there's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
finished it's mostly stable but there's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.350 
finished it's mostly stable but there's
going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.460> some<00:01:56.640> bugs<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.060> updates

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it you know as perfect as it can be the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.240 
it you know as perfect as it can be the
other<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:05.070> one

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
other thing to know is that when one

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
other thing to know is that when one
point<00:02:05.460> eight<00:02:05.579> hits<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> no<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.479> knows<00:02:06.630> when

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
point eight hits and no one knows when

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
point eight hits and no one knows when
it's<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.979> taken<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> while

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it's going to be taken down for a while

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.309 
it's going to be taken down for a while
to<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.090> everything<00:02:09.300> caught<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:09.929> again

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to get everything caught back up again

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.320 
to get everything caught back up again
so<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.979> keep<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.400> mind<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:12.120> probably

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so do keep that in mind now probably

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
part of that signing a process should be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.080 
part of that signing a process should be
checking<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.850> these<00:02:30.330> forms<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.220> some<00:02:33.060> things

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
checking out these forms so some things

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.700 
checking out these forms so some things
folks<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.960> asking<00:02:34.080> about<00:02:34.320> her<00:02:34.410> what<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
folks are asking about her what are the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.560 
folks are asking about her what are the
rules<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.370> really<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.120> talked<00:02:36.300> briefly

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
rules and so really we talked briefly

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.380 
rules and so really we talked briefly
about<00:02:36.810> two<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.170> them<00:02:37.380> one<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.740> griefing

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
about two of them one is griefing

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.880 
about two of them one is griefing
griefing<00:02:39.390> theoretically<00:02:39.960> should<00:02:40.110> be<00:02:40.650> pretty

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
griefing theoretically should be pretty

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.950 
griefing theoretically should be pretty
much<00:02:41.010> impossible<00:02:41.360> because<00:02:42.360> each<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:42.840> own

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
much impossible because each of your own

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.020 
much impossible because each of your own
chunks<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.530> your<00:02:43.800> own<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.790> don't

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
chunks is your own and if you don't

have<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.620> opportunity<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:11.040> create<00:04:11.190> another

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
have the opportunity to create another

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.800 
have the opportunity to create another
world<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.330> don't<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:12.570> your<00:04:12.690> first

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
world so if you don't like your first

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.690 
world so if you don't like your first
one<00:04:13.050> that<00:04:13.680> might<00:04:13.860> be<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> chance<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.550> in

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
one that might be a chance for you in

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.370 
one that might be a chance for you in
the<00:04:15.060> meantime<00:04:15.240> make<00:04:15.780> friends<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.140> someone

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
the meantime make friends of someone

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.440 
the meantime make friends of someone
else<00:04:16.560> work<00:04:17.310> with<00:04:17.489> them<00:04:17.670> get<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.000> know<00:04:18.030> them<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
else work with them get to know them and

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.580 
else work with them get to know them and
perhaps<00:04:18.540> they'll<00:04:18.840> promote<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.200> can<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:19.560> a

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
perhaps they'll promote you can have a

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.289 
perhaps they'll promote you can have a
shared<00:04:19.859> world<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.220> shared<00:04:20.430> experience<00:04:20.580> so

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
shared world in a shared experience so

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.120 
shared world in a shared experience so
it's<00:04:21.419> another<00:04:21.630> way<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.840> kind<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.950> that

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
it's another way to kind of do that

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.980 
it's another way to kind of do that
rerolling<00:04:23.850> takes<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.240> lot<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.419> work<00:04:24.720> on<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
rerolling takes a lot of work on the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.650 
rerolling takes a lot of work on the
backend<00:04:25.169> for<00:04:25.410> welsh<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.979> her<00:04:26.070> crew

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
backend for welsh and her crew

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.680 
backend for welsh and her crew
so<00:04:26.840> we<00:04:27.470> want<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.680> make<00:04:27.740> sure<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.480> that's<00:04:29.480> not

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
so we want to make sure that that's not

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.630 
so we want to make sure that that's not
being<00:04:29.840> done<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.140> too<00:04:30.290> much<00:04:30.410> all<00:04:31.280> right<00:04:31.400> so<00:04:31.520> can

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
being done to too much all right so can

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.370 
being done to too much all right so can
you<00:04:31.700> move<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.000> border<00:04:32.270> location<00:04:32.750> in<00:04:33.080> case<00:04:33.230> you

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
you move the border location in case you

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.990 
you move the border location in case you
didn't<00:04:33.620> know<00:04:33.680> your<00:04:33.920> world<00:04:34.160> or<00:04:34.370> your<00:04:34.490> chunk<00:04:34.820> is

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
didn't know your world or your chunk is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.740 
didn't know your world or your chunk is
basically<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.660> 400<00:04:36.110> by<00:04:36.170> 400<00:04:36.410> square<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.570> no

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
basically a 400 by 400 square and so no

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.630 
basically a 400 by 400 square and so no
you<00:04:38.810> can't<00:04:39.440> move<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.650> border<00:04:39.860> location<00:04:40.250> the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
you can't move the border location the

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.340 
you can't move the border location the
whole<00:04:40.790> lower<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.510> chun<00:04:41.750> care<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:42.110> that<00:04:42.140> your

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
whole lower of chun care is that your

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.050 
whole lower of chun care is that your
kind<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.620> floating<00:04:42.980> around<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.460> in<00:04:43.670> these

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
kind of floating around and in these

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.640 
kind of floating around and in these
pieces<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.780> lands<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.200> are<00:04:45.230> all<00:04:45.380> kind<00:04:45.590> of

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
pieces of lands that are all kind of

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.500 
pieces of lands that are all kind of
connected<00:04:46.040> through<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.310> market<00:04:46.640> hub<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:46.970> so

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
connected through that market hub and so

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.780 
connected through that market hub and so
that's<00:04:47.780> your<00:04:48.080> world<00:04:48.350> but<00:04:48.890> it's<00:04:49.010> at<00:04:49.130> 400<00:04:49.520> by<00:04:49.580> 400

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
that's your world but it's at 400 by 400

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.280 
that's your world but it's at 400 by 400
chunk<00:04:50.180> again<00:04:50.540> a<00:04:50.570> lot<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> hazard<00:04:51.200> of

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
chunk again a lot of the hazard of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.870 
chunk again a lot of the hazard of
server<00:04:51.560> load<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.310> if<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.490> need<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:52.850> a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
server load but if you need to have a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.460 
server load but if you need to have a
lower<00:04:53.090> reason<00:04:53.450> think<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.840> some<00:04:53.960> evil<00:04:54.200> wizard

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
lower reason think of some evil wizard

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.900 
lower reason think of some evil wizard
who<00:04:54.590> blew<00:04:54.830> up<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.040> world<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.430> that's<00:04:55.730> just

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
who blew up the world and that's just

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.310 
who blew up the world and that's just
the<00:04:56.060> only<00:04:56.120> piece<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.540> can<00:04:56.660> get<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.990> kind<00:04:57.290> of

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
the only piece you can get to kind of

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.130 
the only piece you can get to kind of
like<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.560> little<00:04:57.740> prince<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:59.630> can<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.990> get<00:05:00.110> a

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
like the little prince so can I get a

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.610 
like the little prince so can I get a
bigger<00:05:00.350> border<00:05:00.650> same<00:05:00.980> issue<00:05:01.160> no<00:05:02.560> there's<00:05:03.560> a

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
bigger border same issue no there's a

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.320 
bigger border same issue no there's a
couple<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:03.920> questions<00:05:04.250> about<00:05:04.430> bytes<00:05:04.850> which<00:05:05.060> is

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
couple of questions about bytes which is

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.390 
couple of questions about bytes which is
the<00:05:05.450> currency<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.230> since<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.860> marchant's

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
the currency and since the marchant's

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.550 
the currency and since the marchant's
aren't<00:05:07.610> really<00:05:07.760> active<00:05:08.170> all<00:05:09.170> you<00:05:09.290> worry<00:05:09.530> about

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
aren't really active all you worry about

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.380 
aren't really active all you worry about
the<00:05:09.710> currency<00:05:10.040> yet<00:05:10.220> if<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:10.850> when<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.090> comes

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
the currency yet if and when that comes

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.820 
the currency yet if and when that comes
up<00:05:11.570> maybe<00:05:12.020> I'll<00:05:12.140> do<00:05:12.230> another<00:05:12.290> video<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.740> kind

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
up maybe I'll do another video to kind

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.550 
up maybe I'll do another video to kind
of<00:05:12.950> talk<00:05:13.070> about<00:05:13.220> that<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:15.020> does<00:05:15.170> every<00:05:15.380> world

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
of talk about that so does every world

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.080 
of talk about that so does every world
have<00:05:15.710> its<00:05:15.830> own<00:05:15.920> nether<00:05:16.160> right<00:05:16.550> now<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.760> nether

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
have its own nether right now the nether

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.300 
have its own nether right now the nether
is<00:05:17.210> not<00:05:17.300> active<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:17.990> coming<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:18.890> the

that kind of refreshes every week to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
allow folks have access to the resources

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.500 
allow folks have access to the resources

and then every week the nether will

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.390 
and then every week the nether will
regenerate<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:27.680> will<00:05:27.800> be<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:27.950> shared

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400
