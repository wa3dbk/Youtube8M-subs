00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
are actually working at a fairly good

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.860 
are actually working at a fairly good
rate<00:02:12.190> when<00:02:12.819> she<00:02:12.970> started<00:02:13.330> running<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
rate when she started running on the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.750 
rate when she started running on the
treadmill<00:02:14.140> maybe<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.890> year<00:02:15.190> ago<00:02:15.310> she<00:02:15.459> might

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
treadmill maybe a year ago she might

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.600 
treadmill maybe a year ago she might
have<00:02:15.850> burned<00:02:16.060> 500<00:02:16.390> calories<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.350> an<00:02:17.470> hour<00:02:17.650> now

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
have burned 500 calories in an hour now

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.640 
have burned 500 calories in an hour now
she's<00:02:19.090> doing<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.420> similar<00:02:19.660> work<00:02:20.020> out<00:02:20.230> one<00:02:20.440> year

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
she's doing a similar work out one year

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.590 
she's doing a similar work out one year
later<00:02:20.830> she<00:02:21.040> might<00:02:21.370> only<00:02:21.520> be<00:02:21.610> burning<00:02:22.000> 400

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
later she might only be burning 400

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.920 
later she might only be burning 400
calories<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:24.190> second<00:02:24.640> problem<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.270> that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
calories the second problem is that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.710 
calories the second problem is that
there's<00:02:26.290> no<00:02:26.760> caloric<00:02:27.760> expenditure<00:02:27.910> when<00:02:28.600> the
