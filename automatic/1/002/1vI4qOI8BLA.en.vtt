00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know a lot about it so I just pretty

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
know a lot about it so I just pretty
much<00:01:19.979> don't<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> say<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
because either way that's very exciting

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.340 
because either way that's very exciting
but<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.119> don't<00:01:46.299> know<00:01:46.420> why<00:01:46.600> all<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.990> sudden

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
