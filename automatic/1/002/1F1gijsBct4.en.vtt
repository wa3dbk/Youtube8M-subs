the<00:01:30.960> other<00:01:31.140> thing<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> consider<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:32.180> budget

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the other thing to consider is budget

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.390 
the other thing to consider is budget
blu-ray<00:01:33.659> costs<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.680> however

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
blu-ray costs a little bit more however

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
blu-ray costs a little bit more however
the<00:01:35.759> quality<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> supposed<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> little

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the quality is supposed to be a little

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
the quality is supposed to be a little
bit<00:01:37.380> better<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.829> personally<00:01:38.310> can't<00:01:38.549> tell<00:01:39.210> much

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
bit better I personally can't tell much

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.850 
bit better I personally can't tell much
of<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.780> difference<00:01:40.140> there's<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
of a difference there's a little bit of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
of a difference there's a little bit of
a<00:01:40.950> difference<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.400> much<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a difference but not much of a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
a difference but not much of a
difference<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.649> think<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.130> consider

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
difference I think if you consider

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
difference I think if you consider
yourself<00:01:44.790> an<00:01:45.240> average<00:01:45.570> viewer<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.049> not

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
yourself an average viewer you're not

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
yourself an average viewer you're not
going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> notice<00:01:46.860> much<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.549> difference<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
going to notice much of a difference so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.530 
going to notice much of a difference so
price<00:01:49.020> points<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.590> other<00:01:50.430> considerations<00:01:50.939> as

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
price points are other considerations as

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020 
price points are other considerations as
well<00:01:51.750> however<00:01:52.740> different<00:01:53.009> gaming<00:01:53.399> systems
