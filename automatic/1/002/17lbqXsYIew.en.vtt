00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
is pretty cool I've got a bunch of metal

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.850 
is pretty cool I've got a bunch of metal
in<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.530> bunch<00:02:13.709> of

in here and a bunch of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
in here and a bunch of
finn's<00:02:14.070> lots<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.760> surface<00:02:15.180> area<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.660> dissipate

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
finn's lots of surface area to dissipate

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.840 
finn's lots of surface area to dissipate
heat<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.560> well<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:17.100> mean<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.670> actually

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
heat really well I mean you actually

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.250 
heat really well I mean you actually
take<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.210> head<00:02:18.480> off<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.800> see

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
take the head off so you can see

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.510 
take the head off so you can see
reflector<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.380> LED<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.860> everything<00:02:23.220> so

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
reflector and LED and everything so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.920 
reflector and LED and everything so
there's<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.910> reflector<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> see<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
there's that reflector you see it's a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.050 
there's that reflector you see it's a
nice<00:02:25.110> deep<00:02:25.620> reflector<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.700> one<00:02:26.880> has

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
nice deep reflector so this one has

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.410 
nice deep reflector so this one has
pretty<00:02:27.270> good<00:02:27.360> throw<00:02:27.660> again<00:02:27.990> 360<00:02:28.590> meters<00:02:29.220> on

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
pretty good throw again 360 meters on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.820 
pretty good throw again 360 meters on
the<00:02:30.420> max<00:02:30.780> throw<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.710> there's

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the max throw on that and then there's

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.250 
the max throw on that and then there's
that<00:02:31.980> cree<00:02:32.220> xml<00:02:32.730> l<00:02:32.880> edy<00:02:33.150> stainless<00:02:34.050> steel

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that cree xml l edy stainless steel

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.830 
that cree xml l edy stainless steel
bezel<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.310> actually<00:02:35.610> comes<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.540> if

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
bezel and that actually comes off so if

because they know what that stainless

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.100 
because they know what that stainless
steel<00:02:46.890> reflectivity<00:02:47.780> even<00:02:48.780> though<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:48.930> is

bead blasted you know it's definitely a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.860 
bead blasted you know it's definitely a
personal<00:02:50.970> preference<00:02:51.209> thing<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.660> can't

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
personal preference thing but you can't

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
personal preference thing but you can't
take<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.230> off<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.310> to

take that off and it's not going to
affect<00:02:53.610> anything<00:02:53.850> because<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.900> lens<00:02:55.140> is

or anything like that that's not another
level<00:03:06.540> down<00:03:07.200> below<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:08.910> can't<00:03:09.180> take

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
level down below that so you can't take

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.060 
level down below that so you can't take

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
the stainless steel bezel off if you

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.960 
the stainless steel bezel off if you
want<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:12.739> here's<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.890> battery<00:03:14.070> tube<00:03:14.430> two

want to here's the battery tube two
switches<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.450> back<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.410> kind<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.590> see

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
switches on the back you can kind of see

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.229 
switches on the back you can kind of see
the<00:03:16.890> one<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.190> raised<00:03:17.520> up<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.060> one's

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
the one is raised up and the one's

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.090 
the one is raised up and the one's
recessed<00:03:18.750> different<00:03:19.560> shapes<00:03:19.830> different

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
recessed different shapes different

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.550 
recessed different shapes different
sizes<00:03:20.370> different<00:03:21.180> heights<00:03:21.390> very<00:03:22.080> easy<00:03:22.320> to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
sizes different heights very easy to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.410 
sizes different heights very easy to
tell<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.830> difference<00:03:22.860> between<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.610> two<00:03:23.760> just

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
tell the difference between the two just

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.570 
tell the difference between the two just
see<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.630> better<00:03:24.870> when<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:25.920> start<00:03:26.160> using<00:03:26.310> it

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
see that better when we start using it

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.250 
see that better when we start using it
there<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.090> down<00:03:27.299> inside<00:03:27.600> there<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.140> can

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
there it is down inside there you can

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.170 
there it is down inside there you can
see<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> bottom<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.890> head<00:03:29.070> all<00:03:29.700> right<00:03:29.760> so

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
see the bottom of the head all right so

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.870 
see the bottom of the head all right so

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
there from eagletech it also run up of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.000 
there from eagletech it also run up of
four<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.330> two<00:03:39.540> threes<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.200> always<00:03:40.500> recommend

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
four one two threes I always recommend

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.270 
four one two threes I always recommend
8650<00:03:41.640> s<00:03:41.989> because<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> long<00:03:43.650> run<00:03:43.920> they<00:03:44.160> end

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
8650 s because in the long run they end

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880 
8650 s because in the long run they end
up<00:03:44.310> being<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.580> lot<00:03:44.700> cheaper<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.150> run<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.799> you

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
up being a lot cheaper to run and you

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.229 
up being a lot cheaper to run and you
usually<00:03:47.070> get<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.340> longer<00:03:47.519> runtime<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:48.090> well

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
usually get a longer runtime as well

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.570 
usually get a longer runtime as well
alright<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.410> here<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.100> light<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
alright so here is the light with the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.860 
alright so here is the light with the
batteries<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.150> let's<00:03:51.360> talk<00:03:51.540> about<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
batteries in it let's talk about the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.539 
batteries in it let's talk about the
interface<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.650> you've<00:03:52.769> had<00:03:52.950> any<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> other

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
interface if you've had any of the other

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.539 
interface if you've had any of the other
XT<00:03:54.060> series<00:03:54.239> lights<00:03:54.630> same<00:03:55.170> exact<00:03:55.530> interface<00:03:55.950> so

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
XT series lights same exact interface so

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.699 
XT series lights same exact interface so
the<00:03:56.670> main<00:03:56.820> switch<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.720> dumb<00:03:57.989> motor<00:03:58.320> skills

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
the main switch just dumb motor skills

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.410 
the main switch just dumb motor skills
if<00:03:59.220> you're<00:03:59.370> hitting<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.880> end<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.180> switch

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
if you're hitting the end of the switch

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.270 
if you're hitting the end of the switch
you're<00:04:00.660> gonna<00:04:00.810> hit<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.140> main<00:04:01.530> big<00:04:01.920> round

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
you're gonna hit that main big round

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
you're gonna hit that main big round
switch<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.239> raised<00:04:03.510> up<00:04:03.690> higher<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.260> bigger

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
switch it's raised up higher it's bigger

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.840 
switch it's raised up higher it's bigger
it's<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:04.980> first<00:04:05.220> thing<00:04:05.340> you're<00:04:05.489> gonna<00:04:05.549> hit

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
it's the first thing you're gonna hit

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.550 
it's the first thing you're gonna hit
that's<00:04:06.360> always<00:04:06.690> going<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.080> go<00:04:07.170> into<00:04:07.380> max

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
that's always going to go into max

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.009 
that's always going to go into max
output<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.670> this<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.970> designed<00:04:09.299> as<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> tactical

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
output so this is designed as a tactical

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.420 
output so this is designed as a tactical
light<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.440> don't<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.920> use<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.220> that

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
light you don't have to use it for that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.160 
light you don't have to use it for that
but<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.760> interface<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.329> designed<00:04:12.570> around<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
but the interface is designed around the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.110 
but the interface is designed around the
tactical<00:04:13.590> military<00:04:14.070> law<00:04:14.519> enforcement<00:04:14.549> kind

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
tactical military law enforcement kind

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.599 
tactical military law enforcement kind
of<00:04:15.209> guy<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:15.950> it's<00:04:16.950> always<00:04:17.100> going<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.310> go<00:04:17.430> into

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
of guy so it's always going to go into

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.630 
of guy so it's always going to go into
max<00:04:17.790> output<00:04:18.000> first<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:20.010> can<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.250> lightly

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
max output first and you can see lightly

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.890 
max output first and you can see lightly
pressing<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:21.090> will<00:04:21.239> give<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.479> momentary

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
pressing it will give you a momentary

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.690 
pressing it will give you a momentary
clicking<00:04:22.740> all<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.950> way<00:04:23.039> for<00:04:23.250> constant<00:04:23.610> on

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
clicking all the way for constant on

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.089 
clicking all the way for constant on
then<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.450> secondary<00:04:24.930> switch<00:04:25.289> when<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.860> hit

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
then that secondary switch when you hit

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.860 
then that secondary switch when you hit
it<00:04:26.130> it'll<00:04:27.120> switch<00:04:27.300> between

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
it it'll switch between

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.659 
it it'll switch between
you're<00:04:28.020> three<00:04:28.229> different<00:04:28.530> outputs<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.580> when

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
you're three different outputs so when

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.159 
you're three different outputs so when
you<00:04:29.729> have<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.970> light<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.150> hit<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.780> secondary

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
you have the light on hit that secondary

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.900 
you have the light on hit that secondary
switch<00:04:31.500> switches<00:04:32.400> between<00:04:32.699> three<00:04:32.850> different

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
switch switches between three different

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.210 
switch switches between three different
outputs<00:04:33.449> press<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.380> hold<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.740> secondary

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
outputs press and hold the secondary

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.670 
outputs press and hold the secondary
switch<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.330> strobe<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:37.380> it'll<00:04:37.590> be

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
switch and you have strobe and it'll be

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.930 
switch and you have strobe and it'll be
a<00:04:37.710> cost<00:04:37.979> of<00:04:38.130> strobe<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.639> don't<00:04:38.760> have<00:04:38.850> to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
a cost of strobe so you don't have to

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
variable so it'll vary the frequency if

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.290 
variable so it'll vary the frequency if
you<00:04:42.870> turn<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.199> off<00:04:43.320> from<00:04:43.949> off<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.550> secondary

showed you how to detach the stainless

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.360 
showed you how to detach the stainless
steel<00:05:11.490> bezel<00:05:11.699> earlier<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.979> these<00:05:13.979> filters

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
steel bezel earlier so these filters

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.360 
steel bezel earlier so these filters
actually<00:05:14.550> attach<00:05:15.090> where<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.350> detach<00:05:16.830> the

you want to be able to use the red blue

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.650 
you want to be able to use the red blue
green<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.919> I'll<00:05:32.910> take<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.240> red<00:05:33.360> one<00:05:33.539> out

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
green and I'll take the red one out

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.120 
green and I'll take the red one out
outside<00:05:34.169> at<00:05:34.320> least<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.710> show<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:34.919> how<00:05:35.039> it

does outside just so you can get a night

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.600 
does outside just so you can get a night
there<00:05:36.570> an<00:05:36.720> idea<00:05:37.260> of<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.530> difference<00:05:37.919> of<00:05:38.130> what

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
there an idea of the difference of what

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.520 
there an idea of the difference of what
it<00:05:38.700> looks<00:05:38.849> like<00:05:39.030> with<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.479> beam<00:05:39.690> with<00:05:40.500> the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
it looks like with the beam with the

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.570 
it looks like with the beam with the
filter<00:05:40.919> on<00:05:41.070> there<00:05:43.430> okay

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
filter on there okay

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.940 
filter on there okay
we're<00:05:44.700> out<00:05:44.849> here<00:05:45.120> with<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.599> XT<00:05:45.930> 30<00:05:46.169> just<00:05:46.830> the

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
we're out here with the XT 30 just the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.740 
we're out here with the XT 30 just the
xt<00:05:47.220> 30<00:05:47.460> i<00:05:47.580> don't<00:05:47.789> have<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.000> mag<00:05:48.150> light<00:05:48.330> I<00:05:48.570> can't

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
xt 30 i don't have the mag light I can't

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.680 
xt 30 i don't have the mag light I can't
find<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.139> so<00:05:49.639> go<00:05:50.639> watch<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:51.000> other<00:05:51.150> 400<00:05:51.630> videos

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
find it so go watch the other 400 videos

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.839 
find it so go watch the other 400 videos
and<00:05:52.470> then<00:05:52.620> have<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.979> mag<00:05:53.160> light<00:05:53.310> in<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.610> if<00:05:53.760> you

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
and then have the mag light in it if you

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.940 
and then have the mag light in it if you
want<00:05:54.000> to<00:05:54.060> see<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.300> so<00:05:55.260> let's<00:05:55.470> go<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:55.710> turn<00:05:55.770> it

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
want to see it so let's go and turn it

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.529 
want to see it so let's go and turn it
on<00:05:56.070> there<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.030> go

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
on there you go

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.570 
on there you go
about<00:05:57.900> 15<00:05:58.289> feet<00:05:58.470> away<00:05:58.620> that<00:05:58.949> little<00:05:59.280> bush

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
about 15 feet away that little bush

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.120 
about 15 feet away that little bush
under<00:06:00.360> feet<00:06:00.570> out<00:06:00.780> there<00:06:00.840> at<00:06:01.349> that<00:06:01.410> tree<00:06:01.889> I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
under feet out there at that tree I

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.520 
under feet out there at that tree I
cycle<00:06:02.940> through<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.150> different<00:06:03.419> levels<00:06:03.720> as

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
cycle through the different levels as

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.050 
cycle through the different levels as
you<00:06:04.650> saw<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:04.830> was<00:06:04.979> wearing<00:06:05.280> gloves<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.940> those

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
you saw I was wearing gloves and those

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.060 
you saw I was wearing gloves and those
dual<00:06:06.240> switches<00:06:06.660> are<00:06:06.780> no<00:06:06.870> problem<00:06:07.320> even<00:06:07.949> with

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
dual switches are no problem even with

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.520 
dual switches are no problem even with
gloves<00:06:08.220> on<00:06:08.630> still<00:06:09.630> real<00:06:09.810> easy<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.169> find<00:06:10.349> and

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
gloves on still real easy to find and

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.230 
gloves on still real easy to find and
manipulate<00:06:10.949> and<00:06:11.070> everything<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:12.060> let's<00:06:12.120> zoom

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
manipulate and everything so let's zoom

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.879 
manipulate and everything so let's zoom
in<00:06:12.599> just<00:06:13.050> so<00:06:13.139> you<00:06:13.199> can<00:06:13.349> see<00:06:13.470> what<00:06:13.590> that<00:06:13.710> tree

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
in just so you can see what that tree

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.189 
in just so you can see what that tree
looks<00:06:14.099> like<00:06:14.310> obviously<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> very<00:06:15.570> focused<00:06:15.990> beam

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
looks like obviously a very focused beam

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.600 
looks like obviously a very focused beam
on<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.590> that's<00:06:16.860> what<00:06:17.010> gets<00:06:17.160> it<00:06:17.280> that<00:06:17.370> nice

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
on this that's what gets it that nice

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.760 
on this that's what gets it that nice
distance<00:06:18.539> that<00:06:18.960> you'll<00:06:19.110> see<00:06:19.289> better<00:06:19.500> here<00:06:19.710> in

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
distance that you'll see better here in

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.620 
distance that you'll see better here in
just<00:06:19.919> a<00:06:20.010> little<00:06:20.039> while<00:06:20.250> or<00:06:20.970> focus<00:06:21.270> beam<00:06:21.449> on

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
just a little while or focus beam on

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.719 
just a little while or focus beam on
this<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.410> you<00:06:22.530> still<00:06:22.770> have<00:06:23.039> a<00:06:23.310> decent<00:06:23.669> amount

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
this and you still have a decent amount

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.219 
this and you still have a decent amount
of<00:06:23.910> spill<00:06:24.180> so<00:06:24.360> you<00:06:24.449> have<00:06:24.539> the<00:06:24.660> spill<00:06:24.900> coming

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
of spill so you have the spill coming

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.830 
of spill so you have the spill coming
out<00:06:25.320> around<00:06:25.760> and<00:06:26.760> still<00:06:27.000> light<00:06:27.180> up<00:06:27.330> the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
out around and still light up the

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.330 
out around and still light up the
surrounding<00:06:28.349> area<00:06:28.560> really<00:06:28.919> really<00:06:29.130> well<00:06:31.340> I've

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
surrounding area really really well I've

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.770 
surrounding area really really well I've
got<00:06:32.490> a<00:06:32.520> red<00:06:32.729> filter<00:06:33.000> on<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.389> just<00:06:33.539> so<00:06:33.630> you<00:06:33.690> can

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
got a red filter on it just so you can

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.060 
got a red filter on it just so you can
see<00:06:33.870> what<00:06:33.990> that<00:06:34.020> looks<00:06:34.139> like<00:06:34.349> before<00:06:34.800> we<00:06:34.889> try

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
see what that looks like before we try

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.310 
see what that looks like before we try
out<00:06:35.220> the<00:06:35.310> longer<00:06:35.610> distance<00:06:36.020> so<00:06:37.020> there<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:37.260> is

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
out the longer distance so there it is

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.779 
out the longer distance so there it is
with<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:37.590> red<00:06:37.710> filter<00:06:37.950> and<00:06:38.340> it<00:06:38.430> said<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.640> same

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
with the red filter and it said the same

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.190 
with the red filter and it said the same
color<00:06:39.120> balance<00:06:39.539> and<00:06:39.599> everything<00:06:39.719> that<00:06:40.050> it<00:06:40.169> was

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
color balance and everything that it was

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.750 
color balance and everything that it was
at<00:06:40.409> previously<00:06:40.950> see

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
at previously see

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.430 
at previously see
you<00:06:41.850> see<00:06:42.060> basically<00:06:42.690> takes<00:06:42.900> everything<00:06:43.140> and

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
you see basically takes everything and

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.320 
you see basically takes everything and
turns<00:06:43.650> it<00:06:43.800> red<00:06:43.950> so<00:06:44.610> exactly<00:06:45.030> what<00:06:45.180> you'd

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
turns it red so exactly what you'd

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.970 
turns it red so exactly what you'd
expect<00:06:45.360> it<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.870> do<00:06:45.990> and<00:06:46.260> then<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.680> blue<00:06:46.860> and

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
expect it to do and then the blue and

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.250 
expect it to do and then the blue and
the<00:06:47.070> green<00:06:47.250> do<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.000> same<00:06:48.180> thing<00:06:48.480> obviously

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
the green do the same thing obviously

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.870 
the green do the same thing obviously
with<00:06:49.650> the<00:06:49.740> other<00:06:50.070> different<00:06:50.400> colors<00:06:50.520> though

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
with the other different colors though

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.330 
with the other different colors though
that's<00:06:51.870> how<00:06:51.960> it<00:06:52.050> looks<00:06:52.200> like<00:06:52.320> with<00:06:52.620> the<00:06:53.040> filter

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
that's how it looks like with the filter

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.940 
that's how it looks like with the filter
on<00:06:53.490> it<00:06:53.520> and<00:06:53.970> since<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.510> red<00:06:54.690> let's<00:06:55.680> go<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:55.890> try

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
on it and since the red let's go and try

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.230 
on it and since the red let's go and try
out<00:06:56.070> a<00:06:56.100> longer<00:06:56.370> distance<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:56.880> see<00:06:57.000> how<00:06:57.090> this

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
out a longer distance to see how this

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.700 
out a longer distance to see how this
light<00:06:57.420> does<00:06:57.630> at<00:06:57.870> a<00:06:57.900> longer<00:06:58.140> distance<00:07:00.710> okay

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
light does at a longer distance okay

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.200 
light does at a longer distance okay
here's<00:07:01.920> the<00:07:02.040> XT<00:07:02.310> 30<00:07:02.550> have<00:07:02.820> some<00:07:02.850> more<00:07:03.030> distance

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
here's the XT 30 have some more distance

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.120 
here's the XT 30 have some more distance
to<00:07:03.420> work<00:07:03.630> with<00:07:03.840> it's<00:07:04.560> got<00:07:04.740> about<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.980> hundred

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 
focused beam fantastic distance on this

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.490 
focused beam fantastic distance on this
it<00:07:33.000> is<00:07:33.090> weapon<00:07:33.600> mountable<00:07:33.990> if<00:07:34.170> you<00:07:34.290> want<00:07:34.440> to

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
that it does have that capability and

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.610 
that it does have that capability and
obviously<00:07:38.610> all<00:07:38.790> the<00:07:38.880> filters<00:07:39.410> are<00:07:40.410> great

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620
