I said if the greenhouse today
officially<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.720> are<00:00:09.900> breaking<00:00:10.139> ground<00:00:10.349> for

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
officially we are breaking ground for

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.810 
officially we are breaking ground for
the<00:00:10.889> heatsink<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.590> sit<00:00:16.590> down<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> had

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the heatsink so I sit down so that I had

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
the heatsink so I sit down so that I had
a<00:00:17.850> seat<00:00:18.090> bought<00:00:18.240> rocks<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.780> the<00:00:19.020> way<00:00:19.460> that

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
a seat bought rocks out the way that

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.420 
a seat bought rocks out the way that
everything<00:00:20.730> comes<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.360> of<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.510> way

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
everything comes this out of the way

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.330 
everything comes this out of the way
they<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.700> we<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:23.880> breaking<00:00:24.360> ground<00:00:25.340> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
they are we have breaking ground all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
they are we have breaking ground all
right<00:00:26.520> so<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.940> officially<00:00:27.450> made<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> about

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
pretty good so far all right so that's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.349 
pretty good so far all right so that's
the<00:00:43.140> hole<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.769> I'm<00:00:44.249> use<00:00:44.489> cardboard<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.179> hold

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
the hole and I'm use cardboard to hold

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.649 
the hole and I'm use cardboard to hold
the<00:00:45.620> rocks<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.859> stuff<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.159> place<00:00:47.480> gotta<00:00:48.480> go

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
the rocks and stuff in place gotta go

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.809 
the rocks and stuff in place gotta go
get<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:49.879> PVC<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.379> then<00:00:52.399> stockpile<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.519> suck

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
get the PVC and then stockpile and suck

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.729 
get the PVC and then stockpile and suck
out<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.089> rocks<00:00:54.359> I<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> cut<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> cardboard

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
out the rocks I got to cut the cardboard

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.770 
out the rocks I got to cut the cardboard
over<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> over<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.569> stuff

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
over here and over here and the stuff

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.529 
over here and over here and the stuff
some<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.109> cardboard<00:00:58.440> along<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> sides<00:00:59.539> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
some more cardboard along the sides to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
some more cardboard along the sides to
just<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.589> insulate<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.069> little<00:01:02.249> bit<00:01:02.339> more

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
just kind of insulate a little bit more

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.950 
just kind of insulate a little bit more
so<00:01:03.089> this<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.800> heat<00:01:04.800> sink<00:01:04.979> itself

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
so this is the heat sink itself

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
so this is the heat sink itself
piping.this<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.259> go<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.560> ground<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
piping.this going to go in the ground so

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.999 
piping.this going to go in the ground so
basically<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.409> airs<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.829> here

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
basically the airs going to go in here

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.740 
basically the airs going to go in here
come<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:11.610> down<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.320> drill<00:01:13.560> holes<00:01:13.829> here

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
come my down here so I drill holes here

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
come my down here so I drill holes here
to<00:01:15.750> kind<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> disperse<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> heat<00:01:17.090> now<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to kind of disperse the heat now all the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170 
to kind of disperse the heat now all the
way<00:01:18.479> around<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:20.039> another<00:01:20.130> hole<00:01:20.549> each

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
way around and there's another hole each

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.529 
way around and there's another hole each
one<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.539> hole<00:01:21.810> staggered<00:01:24.439> all<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> way<00:01:25.680> down

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
one this hole staggered all the way down

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.940 
one this hole staggered all the way down
and<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.810> disperse<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.289> heat<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.590> get

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and that will disperse the heat out get

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.510 
and that will disperse the heat out get
some<00:01:28.979> bricks<00:01:29.399> in<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:30.770> some<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
some bricks in there some a like a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.779 
some bricks in there some a like a
cement<00:01:32.909> block<00:01:33.200> there's<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.399> railroad<00:01:35.399> tie<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
cement block there's a railroad tie in

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.270 
cement block there's a railroad tie in
there<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> bunch<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.539> glass<00:01:36.920> I'm<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> add

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
there a bunch of glass I'm going to add

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.770 
there a bunch of glass I'm going to add
the<00:01:38.399> installations<00:01:38.909> inside<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.600> more

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the installations inside some more

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.160 
the installations inside some more
smaller<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.149> basically<00:01:42.719> wrap<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
smaller I'm going to basically wrap it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
smaller I'm going to basically wrap it
in<00:01:45.350> pretty<00:01:46.350> much<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.710> cardboard<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.460> that's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
in pretty much this cardboard and that's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
in pretty much this cardboard and that's
pretty<00:01:48.570> much<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> hold<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.380> heat

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pretty much going to hold on the heat

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
pretty much going to hold on the heat
I'm<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> insulated<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> best<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I'm just going to insulated the best I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.069 
I'm just going to insulated the best I
can

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
can

I'm just using what I have here tubing

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.290 
I'm just using what I have here tubing
is<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.579> place<00:01:56.820> though<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.950> tubing<00:01:58.950> comes<00:01:59.159> up

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
is in place though so tubing comes up

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.230 
is in place though so tubing comes up
I<00:02:00.330> got<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.140> put<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.440> outlet<00:02:02.160> in<00:02:02.310> down<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:03.000> and

to put the quikrete in get that put in
and<00:02:21.690> we're<00:02:21.810> good<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:21.990> go

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and we're good to go

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.850 
and we're good to go
what's<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> next<00:02:25.050> step<00:02:27.500> alright<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.709> got

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
what's the next step alright so we got

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.980 
what's the next step alright so we got
the<00:02:28.980> cement<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.550> place<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
the cement in place so we have it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.600 
the cement in place so we have it
cemented<00:02:31.530> right<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:33.650> lot<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.800> edges<00:02:35.070> here<00:02:35.400> I

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
cemented right in a lot of edges here I

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.600 
cemented right in a lot of edges here I
got<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> fill<00:02:36.270> up<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.840> some<00:02:37.050> sand<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.620> then

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
got to fill up with some sand and then

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.330 
got to fill up with some sand and then
it<00:02:38.850> will<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.060> good<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.510> we'll<00:02:40.110> be<00:02:40.340> pretty

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it will be good to go we'll be pretty

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.520 
it will be good to go we'll be pretty
much<00:02:41.459> ready<00:02:41.870> after<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.020> point<00:02:43.200> then<00:02:43.440> I'm

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
much ready after that point then I'm

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.860 
much ready after that point then I'm
going<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.760> solve<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:44.910> off<00:02:45.239> kind<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> little

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
going to solve this off kind of a little

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
going to solve this off kind of a little
bit<00:02:45.959> closer<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.440> ground<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bit closer to the ground so it's a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.320 
bit closer to the ground so it's a
little<00:02:48.270> bit<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.510> flush<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:50.270> they<00:02:51.270> were

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
little bit on flush and then they were

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.910 
little bit on flush and then they were
pretty<00:02:51.660> much<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.930> business<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.620> ready<00:02:52.830> to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
pretty much in business this is ready to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.100 
pretty much in business this is ready to
go<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:54.150> put<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.330> little<00:02:54.360> bit<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.630> dirt<00:02:54.810> over<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
go and put a little bit of dirt over the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.350 
go and put a little bit of dirt over the
top<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.500> smooth<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.040> out<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.880> level<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.300> up

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
top of it smooth it out and level it up

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.420 
top of it smooth it out and level it up
a<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.630> bit<00:02:57.840> pushed<00:02:58.500> rocks<00:02:58.770> back<00:02:59.040> over<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
a little bit pushed rocks back over it

pin summer because well you know
anything<00:03:41.700> black<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.540> going<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.930> hotter<00:03:43.230> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
anything black is going to be hotter and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.610 
anything black is going to be hotter and
this<00:03:44.209> 10km<00:03:45.209> basically<00:03:45.690> with<00:03:45.810> two<00:03:46.049> screws<00:03:46.320> runs

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
this 10km basically with two screws runs

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.460 
this 10km basically with two screws runs
through<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:47.570> sits<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.720> top<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:50.760> will<00:03:50.970> allow

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
through it sits on top that will allow

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.390 
through it sits on top that will allow
the<00:03:52.470> more<00:03:52.680> heat<00:03:52.920> buildup

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
the more heat buildup

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.589 
the more heat buildup
you<00:03:54.819> push<00:03:55.060> down<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.790> take<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.269> off<00:03:58.330> there

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
you push down so I take that off there

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.000 
you push down so I take that off there
on<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:58.750> better<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.200> going<00:03:59.379> to<00:03:59.470> do<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.739> test

and the fill this off I'm going to do a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.210 
and the fill this off I'm going to do a
little<00:04:03.310> test<00:04:03.610> make<00:04:03.970> sure<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.269> working<00:04:05.220> in

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220

on<00:05:02.490> like<00:05:02.640> a<00:05:02.670> small<00:05:03.030> little<00:05:03.210> if<00:05:04.020> it's<00:05:04.230> almost

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
on like a small little if it's almost

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.400 
on like a small little if it's almost
like<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.370> lawnmower<00:05:05.580> battery<00:05:06.320> something<00:05:07.320> like

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
like a lawnmower battery something like

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.040 
like a lawnmower battery something like
that<00:05:07.590> anything<00:05:07.920> is<00:05:08.010> 12<00:05:08.280> volts<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.900> just<00:05:09.900> need<00:05:10.020> a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
that anything is 12 volts I just need a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.450 
that anything is 12 volts I just need a
whole<00:05:10.290> lot<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.500> power<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.830> needs<00:05:11.070> be<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.190> bush

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
whole lot of power just needs be a bush

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.520 
whole lot of power just needs be a bush
that<00:05:11.610> fan<00:05:11.880> at<00:05:12.570> night<00:05:12.840> because<00:05:13.170> what's<00:05:13.440> going

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
that fan at night because what's going

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.350 
that fan at night because what's going
to<00:05:13.590> happen<00:05:13.650> is<00:05:14.040> at<00:05:14.220> night<00:05:14.430> when<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.970> system

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
to happen is at night when the system

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.640 
to happen is at night when the system
whenever<00:05:15.540> everything<00:05:15.870> starts<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.260> cool<00:05:16.470> down

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
whenever everything starts to cool down

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.470 
whenever everything starts to cool down
it's<00:05:17.220> going<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.430> push<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.640> cool<00:05:17.940> air<00:05:18.120> up<00:05:18.270> under

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
it's going to push the cool air up under

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.840 
it's going to push the cool air up under
the<00:05:18.570> ground<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.040> I'll<00:05:20.040> let<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.430> Sun<00:05:20.610> on<00:05:20.760> the

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
the ground and I'll let the Sun on the

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.130 
the ground and I'll let the Sun on the
ground<00:05:21.120> it's<00:05:21.330> actually<00:05:21.600> going<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.780> push<00:05:21.990> the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
ground it's actually going to push the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.200 
ground it's actually going to push the
hot<00:05:22.260> air<00:05:22.410> back<00:05:22.650> out<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.980> rocks<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:23.550> that's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
hot air back out of the rocks so that's

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.860 
hot air back out of the rocks so that's
how<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.420> works

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
how it works

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.340 
how it works
and<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:26.370> right<00:05:26.610> there<00:05:26.670> is<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.420> make<00:05:28.320> a

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
and that right there is I make a

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.490 
and that right there is I make a
heatsink

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
heatsink

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.550 
heatsink
all<00:05:31.500> right<00:05:31.650> if<00:05:31.920> you<00:05:32.040> guys<00:05:32.130> have<00:05:32.340> any<00:05:32.460> questions
