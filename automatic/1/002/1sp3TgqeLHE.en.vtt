i'm not a huge fan because there's

nothing that it does particularly well

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
favor first up let's look at the armor i
mean<00:00:37.860> that's<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.430> protection<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> generally

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
mean that's the protection is generally

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
mean that's the protection is generally
the<00:00:39.690> hallmark<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.500> heavy<00:00:40.710> tank<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> the

the hallmark of a heavy tank and the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
king tiger kind of disappoints it's okay

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.970 
king tiger kind of disappoints it's okay
for<00:00:44.700> bullying<00:00:45.390> these<00:00:45.719> lower<00:00:46.079> tier<00:00:46.440> medium

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
for bullying these lower tier medium

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
for bullying these lower tier medium
tanks<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
tanks because they just don't have the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
tanks because they just don't have the
penetration<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> armor<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> king

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

penetration but the armor of the king
tiger<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> based<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.350> thickness<00:00:53.129> rather<00:00:53.730> than

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
tiger is based on thickness rather than

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
tiger is based on thickness rather than
slope<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.590> armor<00:00:56.010> never<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.550> gets

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
slope and the armor never really gets

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930 
slope and the armor never really gets
any<00:00:57.149> better<00:00:57.480> even<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.199> angling<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.100> if

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
any better even with angling so if

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
any better even with angling so if
you're<00:01:00.239> facing<00:01:00.600> incoming<00:01:01.440> fire<00:01:01.649> head<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.160> your

you're facing incoming fire head on your
armor<00:01:03.180> effectiveness<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> be

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
armor effectiveness is going to be

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.039 
armor effectiveness is going to be
roughly<00:01:04.710> against<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:06.000> 200<00:01:06.540> millimeters

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
roughly against about 200 millimeters

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.580 
roughly against about 200 millimeters
and<00:01:07.880> when<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:08.970> angled<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.810> armor

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and when you're angled your armor

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
and when you're angled your armor
effective<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.520> roughly<00:01:11.939> 200

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
effective is going to be roughly 200

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
effective is going to be roughly 200
millimeters<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> face<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.640> turrets

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
millimeters the face of your turrets

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.690 
millimeters the face of your turrets
again<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.259> effective<00:01:16.710> thickness<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.220> roughly

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
again the effective thickness is roughly

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.749 
again the effective thickness is roughly
200<00:01:18.180> millimeters<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.200> problem<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
200 millimeters the problem is all of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.170 
200 millimeters the problem is all of
the<00:01:21.060> tier<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> heavy<00:01:21.659> tanks<00:01:22.759> except<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.000> the

the tier a heavy tanks except like the

the tier a heavy tanks except like the

is-6 or the KT five they all have over

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
is-6 or the KT five they all have over
200<00:01:28.020> millimetres<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> penetration<00:01:29.100> and

200 millimetres of penetration and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
200 millimetres of penetration and
that's<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.450> heavy<00:01:30.630> tanks<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> tank

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's just the heavy tanks the tank

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
that's just the heavy tanks the tank
destroyers<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> even<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.729> more

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
destroyers are going to even have more

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.510 
destroyers are going to even have more
than<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.170> mediums<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.009> want<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
than that the mediums that want to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.359 
than that the mediums that want to
penetrate<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.420> lode<00:01:37.079> gold<00:01:37.110> ammo<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.159> do

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
penetrate you in lode gold ammo can do

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.270 
penetrate you in lode gold ammo can do
so<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.299> your<00:01:39.479> armor<00:01:39.869> isn't<00:01:40.110> very<00:01:40.439> effective<00:01:41.159> at

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so so your armor isn't very effective at

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.859 
so so your armor isn't very effective at
all<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.970> against<00:01:42.360> tier<00:01:42.570> eights

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
all and this is just against tier eights

left-clicking on your tank that's a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.100 
left-clicking on your tank that's a
pretty<00:01:49.409> big<00:01:49.740> downside<00:01:50.899> compare<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.930> to

pretty big downside compare that to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.550 
pretty big downside compare that to
something<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> is-3<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.509> is-3s<00:01:55.170> hull

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
something like the is-3 the is-3s hull

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.679 
something like the is-3 the is-3s hull
is<00:01:55.829> definitely<00:01:56.369> weaker<00:01:56.759> than<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> King

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
is definitely weaker than the King

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.550 
is definitely weaker than the King
Tigers<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.579> just<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> vast<00:01:59.880> majority<00:02:00.000> of

stronger<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:05.159> based<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.610> angles<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.299> will

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.529 
stronger it's based on angles and will
bounce<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.350> lot<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.950> shots<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.849> very<00:02:09.149> tough

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
I on defensively it just has to hope

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.160 
I on defensively it just has to hope
that<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.910> opponent<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.990> bounce

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the tank is okay nothing spectacular one

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
bullying a t32 and the t32 in general is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.240 
bullying a t32 and the t32 in general is
going<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.260> very<00:02:37.260> tough<00:02:37.620> turret<00:02:38.040> in

going to have a very tough turret in

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.820 
going to have a very tough turret in
comparison<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> t32<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.200> not

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830

face hugging a little bit more than he

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120 
face hugging a little bit more than he
is<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:47.340> t32<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:48.300> auto<00:02:48.690> aiming<00:02:49.170> into<00:02:49.440> garb<00:02:49.950> ads

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
is the t32 is auto aiming into garb ads

in manland also the t32 has penetration

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.840 
in manland also the t32 has penetration
of<00:02:54.780> 198<00:02:55.850> which<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.270> just<00:02:57.750> enough<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:59.400> not

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
of 198 which is just enough to not

consistently<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.590> find<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> next<00:03:04.920> shot<00:03:05.220> very

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
consistently I find the next shot very

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.610 
consistently I find the next shot very
funny<00:03:05.850> though<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:07.080> those<00:03:07.200> things

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
funny though it's one of those things

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.670

the<00:03:34.230> gun<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> katie<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.310> fine<00:03:36.270> i<00:03:36.720> mean<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
the gun on the katie is fine i mean it

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.979 
the gun on the katie is fine i mean it

that's<00:03:40.380> nice<00:03:40.790> but<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.120> 320<00:03:42.870> damage<00:03:43.320> per<00:03:43.650> shot

that's nice but the 320 damage per shot

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.270 
that's nice but the 320 damage per shot
means<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.480> can't<00:03:45.780> trade<00:03:46.110> profitably<00:03:46.440> with

it performs poorly in all areas so the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.740 
it performs poorly in all areas so the

have<00:04:37.190> marginally<00:04:38.190> less<00:04:38.400> penetration<00:04:38.700> okay<00:04:39.510> so

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
have marginally less penetration okay so

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.770 
have marginally less penetration okay so
the<00:04:39.900> King<00:04:40.050> Tiger<00:04:40.370> does<00:04:41.370> not<00:04:41.580> shine<00:04:42.000> there<00:04:42.330> the

the King Tiger does not shine there the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.050 
the King Tiger does not shine there the
Alpha<00:04:43.230> there's<00:04:43.500> one<00:04:43.889> tank<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.490> has<00:04:44.610> less

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
Alpha there's one tank that has less

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.900 
Alpha there's one tank that has less
alpha<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.230> tier<00:04:46.910> there's<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.960> mobility

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
alpha in tier there's the mobility

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.879 
alpha in tier there's the mobility
doesn't<00:04:50.910> have<00:04:51.030> mobility<00:04:51.510> either<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.710> it's

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
doesn't have mobility either so it's

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.450 
doesn't have mobility either so it's
like<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.580> go<00:04:53.790> down<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.210> checklist<00:04:54.780> and

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
like you go down the checklist and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.900 
like you go down the checklist and
literally<00:04:56.460> every<00:04:57.030> other<00:04:57.210> tank<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:58.280> tier<00:04:59.280> every

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
literally every other tank in tier every

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.659 
literally every other tank in tier every
other<00:05:00.030> heavy<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.660> tier<00:05:01.020> does<00:05:01.740> something

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
other heavy in tier does something

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.960 
other heavy in tier does something
better<00:05:03.000> than<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.419> king<00:05:03.630> tiger<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.580> has<00:05:05.580> all

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
better than the king tiger and has all

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.909 
better than the king tiger and has all
of<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.240> things<00:05:06.389> that<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.780> King<00:05:06.990> Tiger<00:05:07.200> has<00:05:07.590> as

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
of the things that the King Tiger has as

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.070 
of the things that the King Tiger has as
well<00:05:08.100> so<00:05:08.460> like<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.880> t32<00:05:09.330> yeah<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:09.720> might<00:05:09.930> have

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
well so like the t32 yeah I might have

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.440 
well so like the t32 yeah I might have
slightly<00:05:10.440> less<00:05:10.800> penetration<00:05:11.150> but<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.270> also

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
slightly less penetration but it also

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.540 
slightly less penetration but it also
has<00:05:12.810> better<00:05:13.169> gun<00:05:13.380> depression<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.250> much

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
has better gun depression and a much

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.510 
has better gun depression and a much
stronger<00:05:14.910> turret<00:05:15.479> so<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.740> just<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:17.190> strict

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
stronger turret so it is just a strict

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520 
stronger turret so it is just a strict
upgrade<00:05:18.060> there's<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.360> trick<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:18.900> can<00:05:19.020> use

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
upgrade there's a trick that you can use

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.150 
upgrade there's a trick that you can use
that's<00:05:20.310> going<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.180> be<00:05:21.600> very<00:05:21.630> very<00:05:22.169> useful<00:05:22.710> in<00:05:23.070> a

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
that's going to be very very useful in a

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.010 
that's going to be very very useful in a
lot<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.430> situations<00:05:23.669> that<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:24.630> King<00:05:24.840> Tiger

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
lot of situations that the King Tiger

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.610 
lot of situations that the King Tiger
doesn't<00:05:25.350> have<00:05:25.620> or<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.490> VK<00:05:27.090> has<00:05:27.870> great

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
doesn't have or like the VK has great

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.240 
doesn't have or like the VK has great
mobility<00:05:29.300> no<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.510> might<00:05:30.690> not<00:05:30.900> have<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:32.039> best

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
mobility no it might not have the best

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.090 
mobility no it might not have the best
armor<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:32.820> world<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.450> 175<00:05:34.320> pen<00:05:34.620> guns<00:05:34.890> are

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
armor in the world so 175 pen guns are

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.029 
armor in the world so 175 pen guns are
going<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.370> be<00:05:35.460> more<00:05:35.669> effective<00:05:36.180> than<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:37.080> but

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
going to be more effective than it but

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.610 
going to be more effective than it but
the<00:05:38.550> mobility<00:05:39.090> is<00:05:39.180> just<00:05:39.450> a<00:05:39.539> huge<00:05:39.840> asset<00:05:40.110> and

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
the mobility is just a huge asset and

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.640 
the mobility is just a huge asset and
being<00:05:40.979> somewhat<00:05:41.729> more<00:05:42.320> protected<00:05:43.320> against

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
being somewhat more protected against

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.320 
being somewhat more protected against
175<00:05:44.340> pen<00:05:44.640> guns<00:05:44.880> just<00:05:45.150> isn't<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:45.840> valuable<00:05:47.330> so

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
175 pen guns just isn't that valuable so

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.210 
175 pen guns just isn't that valuable so
here<00:05:48.600> we're<00:05:48.780> approaching<00:05:49.229> the<00:05:49.650> moment<00:05:50.160> of

here we're approaching the moment of
truth<00:05:50.280> where<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.180> tiger<00:05:51.570> to<00:05:51.860> just<00:05:52.860> doesn't

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
truth where the tiger to just doesn't

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.360 
truth where the tiger to just doesn't
have<00:05:53.970> enough<00:05:54.000> to<00:05:54.750> carry<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.289> game<00:05:55.530> recently

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
have enough to carry the game recently

have enough to carry the game recently
there<00:05:56.940> were<00:05:57.090> reviews<00:05:57.600> on<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.930> yank<00:05:58.200> Panther<00:05:58.650> 2

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
there were reviews on the yank Panther 2

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.210 
there were reviews on the yank Panther 2
which<00:05:59.250> squared<00:05:59.639> off<00:05:59.820> against<00:06:00.389> five<00:06:01.110> tanks<00:06:01.830> in

a hole down situation and came out

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.940 
a hole down situation and came out
victorious<00:06:05.280> I<00:06:05.940> mean<00:06:06.120> like<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:07.260> was<00:06:07.410> shockingly

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
victorious I mean like it was shockingly

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.490 
victorious I mean like it was shockingly
one<00:06:08.340> side<00:06:08.610> and<00:06:08.850> how<00:06:08.970> well<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.870> yag<00:06:10.080> Panther
