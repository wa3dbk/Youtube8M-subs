thing<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.120> remember<00:00:26.210> when<00:00:26.540> you<00:00:26.690> when<00:00:26.990> you're

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
thing to remember when you when you're

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.150 
thing to remember when you when you're
going<00:00:27.200> to<00:00:27.320> do<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.410> straightforward<00:00:27.740> mashed

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
going to do a straightforward mashed

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.580 
going to do a straightforward mashed
potato<00:00:28.490> is<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.360> potatoes<00:00:29.900> need<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.260> be<00:00:30.380> cut

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
potato is the potatoes need to be cut

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.520 
potato is the potatoes need to be cut
fairly<00:00:30.890> evenly<00:00:31.310> in<00:00:31.520> size<00:00:32.200> so<00:00:33.200> they're<00:00:33.410> all

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
fairly evenly in size so they're all

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.260 
fairly evenly in size so they're all
roughly<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.190> same<00:00:34.460> size<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.000> i<00:00:35.030> have<00:00:35.149> to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
roughly the same size so i have to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.640 
roughly the same size so i have to
measure<00:00:35.420> them<00:00:35.629> but<00:00:35.809> roughly<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.230> same<00:00:36.410> size

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
measure them but roughly the same size

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.630 
measure them but roughly the same size
the<00:00:37.600> other<00:00:38.600> thing<00:00:38.810> is<00:00:38.990> with<00:00:39.770> mashed<00:00:40.520> potatoes

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
the other thing is with mashed potatoes

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.240 
the other thing is with mashed potatoes
you'll<00:00:41.300> generally<00:00:41.900> start<00:00:42.230> them<00:00:42.350> off<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.740> cold

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
you'll generally start them off in cold

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.910 
you'll generally start them off in cold
water<00:00:43.520> if<00:00:44.090> you're<00:00:44.270> doing<00:00:44.450> new<00:00:44.630> potatoes<00:00:45.140> you

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
water if you're doing new potatoes you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.140 
water if you're doing new potatoes you
would<00:00:46.070> normally<00:00:46.340> start<00:00:46.490> them<00:00:46.610> off<00:00:46.730> in<00:00:46.760> boredom

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
would normally start them off in boredom

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.840 
would normally start them off in boredom
so<00:00:48.079> these<00:00:48.230> are<00:00:48.380> in<00:00:48.500> cold<00:00:48.680> water<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.310> they're

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
so these are in cold water and they're

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.910 
so these are in cold water and they're
going<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.060> just<00:00:50.239> go<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.570> stove<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.590> rock

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
going to just go on the stove and rock

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.860 
going to just go on the stove and rock
the<00:00:52.100> world<00:00:52.310> he's<00:00:53.120> going<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.420> add<00:00:53.540> a<00:00:53.570> little<00:00:53.750> bit

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
the world he's going to add a little bit

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.460 
the world he's going to add a little bit
of<00:00:54.020> salt<00:00:54.260> not<00:00:55.600> too<00:00:56.600> much<00:00:56.750> as<00:00:57.140> well<00:00:57.260> we're<00:00:57.440> just

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
of salt not too much as well we're just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.220 
of salt not too much as well we're just
it<00:00:58.090> at<00:00:59.090> the<00:00:59.239> end<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.630> when<00:00:59.750> up<00:00:59.840> nice<00:01:00.020> turn

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
it at the end of it when up nice turn

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.940 
it at the end of it when up nice turn
off<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:02.059> that's<00:01:02.210> our<00:01:02.420> mashed<00:01:02.630> potato<00:01:02.960> they're

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950

nice<00:01:08.689> low<00:01:08.899> heat<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.469> then<00:01:09.740> we<00:01:09.829> can<00:01:09.950> drain<00:01:10.100> off

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
nice low heat and then we can drain off

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.090 
nice low heat and then we can drain off
and<00:01:10.670> ready<00:01:10.850> for<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.119> mash<00:01:11.829> potatoes<00:01:12.829> are<00:01:13.009> now

when<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.680> boiling<00:01:55.830> potatoes<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.690> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
when you're boiling potatoes is that you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719 
when you're boiling potatoes is that you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
cut them all fairly evenly in size so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.740 
cut them all fairly evenly in size so
that<00:01:59.760> they<00:02:00.000> cook<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.350> rate<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.750> also
