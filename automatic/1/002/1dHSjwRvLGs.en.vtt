but they don't work quite as well and it

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.730 
but they don't work quite as well and it
also<00:00:14.700> sucks<00:00:15.030> because<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.020> fake<00:00:16.470> tooth

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
also sucks because I have a fake tooth

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
also sucks because I have a fake tooth
in<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> front<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.699> broke<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
in the front I broke it when I was a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.750 
in the front I broke it when I was a
little<00:00:18.810> kid<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.189> trying<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.580> some

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760

stunts rollerblading

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.170 
stunts rollerblading
so<00:00:22.560> anyways<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.070> sucks<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.910> always

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so anyways it sucks because it's always

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.370 
so anyways it sucks because it's always
a<00:00:24.210> different<00:00:24.510> color<00:00:24.689> than<00:00:24.869> my<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:25.109> teeth

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
a different color than my other teeth

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.990 
a different color than my other teeth
