 if you like to create 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.049
 own fantasies in creating 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.059
 do interesting and useful things with your own hands 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.849

 occupation just for you to

 learn about clay modeling classes 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.430
 hobby and we turned to the master of his 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 affairs Natalia top speaker locations we 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.410
 little believe the lights on the magic 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.510
 material because it absorbs our 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 positive emotions people when summer they 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.769
 there was always a positive moment how many 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 I have not worked always positive 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 emotions and people who eat because 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
 Essentially, they all tell me that this dish 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 magic start working 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.989
 even a child 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 take me to childhood left head 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.450
 memory like a mannequin 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.750
 she is artificially the very thing 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.030
 primitive then remember bridge technique 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 and start working long enough 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 see some courses master classes 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.559
 read books on the internet 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.840
 this will be enough to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.960
 start exactly sculpt yourself 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 always remember that Bina is not plasticine 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.020
 this material is much stronger 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 but you need to treat him like this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.720
 how do i work with a small project 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920
 own vision 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.810
 right here 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.480
 no it's like a magical process going on 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.700
 there 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.350
 we all rip off all the products that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.720
 there is practically no 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.790
 strain now 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.100
 and breaks when summer devices need 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.320
 very serious about this sometimes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.410
 of course torment the product to such an extent 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.330
 what then can it crack 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.340
 just perfect perfect point 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.680
 of dishes and children is more appropriate 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.510
 fantasy here but of course adult 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.030
 a little easier then calmly such 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.550
 heavy stuff with him need effort 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.980
 apply clay modeling is a pleasant 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.380
 pastime that do not require 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.119
 significant material and physical and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.860
 drink it other expenses 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.590
 and pleasure brings back 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.830
 because on any for the good which 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.430
 produces but the most important thing of course is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.850
 find a place where she could 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.350
 like 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.760
 all discussed 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.209
 hot in the chair 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.219
 leaking derbent 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.170
 drown at about ten o'clock she dials 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.170
 You can so up to 800 degrees 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.340
 this is a very ancient idea to sing country 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 you can try to learn it there 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.850
 easy anyone can master 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.850
 so anything is possible
