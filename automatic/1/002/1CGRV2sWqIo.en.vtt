light painting basically and we're not
gonna<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.260> through<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> technical<00:00:38.219> aspect

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
gonna go through the technical aspect

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.840 
gonna go through the technical aspect
too<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.350> very<00:00:40.350> simple<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> tripod

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

as you you keep the button press in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
as you you keep the button press in
order<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> overcome<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.680> need

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
order to overcome that you will need

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
order to overcome that you will need
either<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.640> wireless<00:01:15.299> remote<00:01:15.540> control<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
either a wireless remote control or a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.760 
either a wireless remote control or a
corded<00:01:17.610> remote<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.020> what<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.439> light

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
corded remote so what is what is light

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
corded remote so what is what is light
painting<00:01:20.159> basically<00:01:20.880> light<00:01:21.360> painting<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
painting basically light painting is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.969 
painting basically light painting is
using<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> dark<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:24.030> canvas<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.770> play

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
using the dark as a canvas you can play

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
using the dark as a canvas you can play
with<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> light<00:01:26.400> source<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.720> long<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
with the light source for as long as you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.609 
with the light source for as long as you
want<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.030> camera<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.689> record<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
want and the camera will record all the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.130 
want and the camera will record all the
trails<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.700> doesn't<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> move<00:01:33.450> fast<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
trails it doesn't have to move fast it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
trails it doesn't have to move fast it
doesn't<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> move<00:01:34.890> slow<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.610> depends<00:01:36.150> on

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
doesn't have to move slow it depends on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
doesn't have to move slow it depends on
the<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.810> depends<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> power<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> light

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the it depends on the power of the light

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
the it depends on the power of the light
and<00:01:38.340> your<00:01:38.460> camera<00:01:38.790> settings<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:39.960> gonna
