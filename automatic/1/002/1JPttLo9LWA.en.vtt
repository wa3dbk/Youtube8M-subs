little show of how to change your
logbook<00:00:16.830> wires<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.270> ignition<00:00:18.510> coils

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.330 

this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> 95<00:00:24.869> s10<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.980> has<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> 2.2

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
this is a 95 s10 it has a 2.2

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.690 
this is a 95 s10 it has a 2.2
four-cylinder<00:00:33.980> first<00:00:34.980> thing<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.250> always<00:00:35.309> tell

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
four-cylinder first thing I always tell

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
four-cylinder first thing I always tell
everybody<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.809> sure<00:00:37.190> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you happen to touch anything electrical

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
you happen to touch anything electrical
while<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:45.840> working<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.860> don't<00:00:46.980> fry<00:00:47.250> your

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
while you're working you don't fry your

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
while you're working you don't fry your
engine<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.450> very<00:00:48.660> important

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
engine so that's very important

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.410 
engine so that's very important

second of all have all your blue parts
sitting<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.870> ready<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> new<00:00:53.219> wires<00:00:53.489> these

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
sitting out ready so the new wires these

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.439 
sitting out ready so the new wires these
are<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> ignition<00:00:55.170> coils<00:00:55.559> look<00:00:56.039> like

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
are what the ignition coils look like

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.689 
are what the ignition coils look like
when<00:00:57.449> they're<00:00:57.600> new<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:59.070> few<00:00:59.309> minutes<00:00:59.579> I'm

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
on this model of year so two separate

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
on this model of year so two separate
one<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.220> four-cylinder<00:01:05.939> spark<00:01:06.689> plug<00:01:06.840> wires

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
one for four-cylinder spark plug wires

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
one for four-cylinder spark plug wires
are<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.820> basically<00:01:08.820> there's<00:01:09.150> four

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
are right here basically there's four

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.660 
are right here basically there's four
spark<00:01:09.659> plugs<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.250> pop<00:01:11.490> them

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
spark plugs from there you just pop them

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.460 
spark plugs from there you just pop them
off<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:14.210> such<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.810> case<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
working area for the actual part that we

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.030 
working area for the actual part that we
just<00:01:32.670> showed<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.270> top<00:01:33.740> which<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
just showed you up top which is the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.640 
just showed you up top which is the
coils<00:01:35.600> there's<00:01:36.600> two<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.200> trying<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
coils there's two of them trying to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
coils there's two of them trying to
paint<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.240> numbers<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.720> them

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
paint in here they have numbers on them

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
paint in here they have numbers on them
and<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> ones<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.590> vote<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.310> won't<00:01:41.520> be

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and the ones you vote they won't be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.480 
and the ones you vote they won't be
numbered<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> same<00:01:43.590> first

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
numbered but pretty much the same first

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.999 
numbered but pretty much the same first
thing<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.759> did<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.770> disconnected<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
thing I did was I disconnected all the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190 
thing I did was I disconnected all the
four<00:01:47.220> wires<00:01:47.460> basically<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.570> four<00:01:48.780> wires<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
four wires basically the four wires that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160 
four wires basically the four wires that
I<00:01:49.229> took<00:01:49.320> off<00:01:49.619> from<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> top<00:01:50.869> are<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> same

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I took off from the top are the same

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.710 
I took off from the top are the same
ones<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.119> case<00:01:54.390> I'm

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
ones I take off here so in this case I'm

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.389 
ones I take off here so in this case I'm
just<00:01:54.780> gonna<00:01:55.079> match<00:01:55.290> him<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> timing

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
just gonna match him up by the timing

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.420 
just gonna match him up by the timing
which<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.719> find<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> time<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.380> any<00:01:59.070> kind

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
which is you find the time in any kind

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.480 
which is you find the time in any kind
of<00:01:59.520> computer<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:01.259> you're<00:02:01.469> smart<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
of computer or if you're smart you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.490 
of computer or if you're smart you
probably<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.030> your<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.329> manual<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
probably have your little manual if you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.469 
probably have your little manual if you
don't<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> manual<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.820> suggest<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> go<00:02:06.450> out

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
don't have a manual I suggest you go out

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.969 
don't have a manual I suggest you go out
