00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
because i was using a sniper rifle and I

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.719 
because i was using a sniper rifle and I
mean<00:01:07.960> know<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.140> lot<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.530> people<00:01:08.649> are<00:01:09.220> hating<00:01:09.580> on

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.020 
mean know a lot of people are hating on
snipers<00:01:10.180> but<00:01:10.479> why<00:01:10.959> so<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.250> came<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.940> the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
snipers but why so I came to the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.699 
snipers but why so I came to the
conclusion<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.599> lots<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.319> people<00:01:14.380> hate

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:14.709 
conclusion that lots of people hate

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.749 
conclusion that lots of people hate
snipers<00:01:15.099> because<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.840> don't<00:01:17.200> have<00:01:17.289> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
snipers because they don't have the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.300 
snipers because they don't have the
chance<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.910> fight<00:01:19.179> back<00:01:19.209> so<00:01:20.050> in<00:01:20.380> my<00:01:20.560> opinion<00:01:20.679> I

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
chance to fight back so in my opinion I

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.790 
chance to fight back so in my opinion I
played<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.179> first<00:01:22.899> person<00:01:23.229> shooter<00:01:23.440> because

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
played the first person shooter because

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.850 
played the first person shooter because
I<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.640> some<00:01:25.479> kind<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.869> competitive

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
I have some kind of competitive

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.330 
I have some kind of competitive
atmosphere<00:01:27.819> so<00:01:28.660> it<00:01:29.259> most<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.009> time<00:01:30.130> it's

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
atmosphere so it most of the time it's

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.180 
atmosphere so it most of the time it's
1-1<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.450> one<00:01:31.660> with<00:01:31.990> more<00:01:32.200> skill<00:01:32.530> or

winning the fight without having seen
them<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:10.209> really<00:02:10.899> really<00:02:11.349> low<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.709> it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
them is really really low so it's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.220 
them is really really low so it's
practically<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.330> same<00:02:13.599> as<00:02:13.780> getting<00:02:13.900> sniped

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
practically the same as getting sniped

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.430 
practically the same as getting sniped
and<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> whole<00:02:16.660> point<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.200> I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
and that's the whole point of this I

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.130 
and that's the whole point of this I
mean<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.280> about<00:02:18.670> who<00:02:18.910> was<00:02:19.090> able<00:02:19.450> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
mean it's just about who was able to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.410 
mean it's just about who was able to
to<00:02:20.470> spot<00:02:20.770> or<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.340> find<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> enemy<00:02:21.880> at<00:02:22.150> first

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
to spot or to find the enemy at first

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.860 
to spot or to find the enemy at first
and<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.830> know<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.730> very<00:02:25.240> annoying<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.630> you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and I know it's very annoying when you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.809 
and I know it's very annoying when you
just<00:02:26.110> got<00:02:26.319> shot<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> head<00:02:27.280> with<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.490> sniper

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
just got shot to the head with a sniper

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.300 
just got shot to the head with a sniper
rifle<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:29.290> you're<00:02:29.440> dead<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:30.040> if

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
rifle and then you're dead but if

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.160 
rifle and then you're dead but if
someone's<00:02:30.940> shooting<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.360> with<00:02:31.510> an<00:02:31.750> assault

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
someone's shooting you with an assault

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.710 
someone's shooting you with an assault
rifle<00:02:32.459> it's<00:02:33.459> practically<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.030> same<00:02:34.270> because

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
rifle it's practically the same because

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.070 
rifle it's practically the same because
you're<00:02:35.260> also<00:02:35.590> going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.069> die<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.690> mean<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.930> can

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
you're also going to die I mean you can

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.170 
you're also going to die I mean you can
see<00:02:38.320> how<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.560> die<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.820> no<00:02:40.000> chance

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
see how you die but you have no chance

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.540 
see how you die but you have no chance
of<00:02:40.360> fighting<00:02:40.510> bed<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:41.650> my<00:02:41.800> opinion<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.520> my

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
of fighting bed in my opinion in my

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.449 
of fighting bed in my opinion in my
opinion<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:43.500> something<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.709> placebo

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
opinion it's something like a placebo

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.620 
opinion it's something like a placebo
effect<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.480> you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
effect so that you think that if you

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.530 
effect so that you think that if you
notice<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:51.310> have<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.610> chance<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.330> fight

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
notice it you have the chance to fight

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.600 
notice it you have the chance to fight
back<00:02:52.570> but<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.500> most<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.280> time<00:02:54.430> that's

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
back but the most of the time that's

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.250 
back but the most of the time that's
really<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.060> case<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.510> there<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:55.900> chance

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
really the case I know there is chance

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.210 
really the case I know there is chance
but<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:57.610> my<00:02:57.760> opinion<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.510> chances<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.920> small

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
but in my opinion the chances so small

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.020 
but in my opinion the chances so small
like<00:03:01.019> most<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.670> you're<00:03:03.670> going<00:03:03.910> to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
like most of the time you're going to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.410 
like most of the time you're going to
die<00:03:04.269> anyways<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.890> was<00:03:06.100> my<00:03:06.180> opinion<00:03:07.180> on

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
die anyways so that was my opinion on

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.479 
die anyways so that was my opinion on
the<00:03:07.570> topic<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:08.080> guess<00:03:08.320> that's<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.040> reason<00:03:09.130> why

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
the topic I guess that's the reason why

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.540 
the topic I guess that's the reason why
so<00:03:10.450> many<00:03:10.510> people<00:03:10.750> hate<00:03:11.440> snipers<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.040> say<00:03:12.400> they

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
so many people hate snipers and say they

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.960 
so many people hate snipers and say they
overpowered<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.470> think<00:03:14.709> about<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.190> it's

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
overpowered but just think about it it's

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.940 
overpowered but just think about it it's
my<00:03:16.180> /<00:03:16.390> has<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.840> hit<00:03:16.989> his<00:03:17.110> target<00:03:17.500> in<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.769> head

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
my / has to hit his target in the head

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.970 
my / has to hit his target in the head
to<00:03:18.550> get<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.730> one<00:03:18.940> shot<00:03:19.120> kill<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.080> takes

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
to get a one shot kill and that takes

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.070 
to get a one shot kill and that takes
some<00:03:21.220> skill<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:22.330> have<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.510> think<00:03:22.870> about<00:03:22.959> a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
some skill you have to think about a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.050 
some skill you have to think about a
bullet<00:03:23.410> drop<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.070> traveling<00:03:24.549> time<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.940> the
