00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
have more than one person set it up so

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
have more than one person set it up so
that<00:00:31.170> goes<00:00:31.439> much<00:00:31.650> faster<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.120> done

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that goes much faster but it can be done

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.780 
that goes much faster but it can be done
by<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.630> person<00:00:33.829> now<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> made<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.670> a

retardant<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.210> those<00:00:39.329> rains<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.170> water

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
retardant so with those rains the water

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.380

some drawstrings here in the middle
that's<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.270> call<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> quick<00:00:51.719> release

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
that's what they call a quick release

pull<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.430> those<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.210> snaps<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> place

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pull up on those and it snaps in place

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.400 
pull up on those and it snaps in place
for<00:00:54.989> its<00:00:55.110> first<00:00:55.289> stage<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> rest<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> legs

for its first stage the rest of the legs

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
for its first stage the rest of the legs
just<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.980> snapping<00:00:59.629> mechanism<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:00.899> four

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
just have snapping mechanism on all four

sides

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.810 

now<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:08.990> does<00:01:09.140> come<00:01:09.350> with<00:01:09.470> 10<00:01:09.710> states<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.670> those

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
now it does come with 10 states so those

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.040 
now it does come with 10 states so those
would<00:01:10.910> be<00:01:11.030> great<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.390> use<00:01:11.570> when<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.870> are

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
first by undoing the mechanisms there

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.060 
first by undoing the mechanisms there
and<00:03:05.060> then<00:03:05.540> letting<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.019> fall<00:03:06.230> down<00:03:06.290> pulling

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
pushed down what we pulled before that

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:48.089 
pushed down what we pulled before that
helps<00:03:35.599> it<00:03:35.659> to<00:03:35.750> collapse<00:03:37.390> pull<00:03:38.390> your<00:03:38.540> sides<00:03:38.750> up
