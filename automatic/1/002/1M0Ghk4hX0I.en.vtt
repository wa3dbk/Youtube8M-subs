00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
go on but they did have the gear too and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.210 
go on but they did have the gear too and
the<00:03:30.030> gear<00:03:30.239> fit<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.989> gear<00:03:31.200> 2<00:03:31.410> has<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> new<00:03:31.889> design

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the gear fit the gear 2 has a new design

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.129 
the gear fit the gear 2 has a new design
which<00:03:32.489> looks<00:03:32.790> good<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.720> addition<00:03:34.079> of

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
which looks good on and the addition of

which looks good on and the addition of
a<00:03:34.260> home<00:03:34.440> button<00:03:34.709> made<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.370> operating<00:03:35.849> system

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
a home button made the operating system

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.670 
a home button made the operating system
easier<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.120> use<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.900> game<00:03:38.080> fit<00:03:38.350> however

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
easier to use the game fit however

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.230 
easier to use the game fit however

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
really sold meat of a potential of

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.750 
really sold meat of a potential of
smartwatches<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.770> curve<00:03:42.040> design<00:03:42.340> looked

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
smartwatches the curve design looked

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.670 
smartwatches the curve design looked
really<00:03:43.030> nice<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.750> interface<00:03:44.200> was<00:03:44.380> easy

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
really nice and the interface was easy

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.860 
really nice and the interface was easy
to<00:03:44.890> use<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.280> clear<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.790> understand<00:03:46.270> for<00:03:46.720> me

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
to use and clear to understand for me

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.540 
to use and clear to understand for me
with<00:03:47.080> smartwatches<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.830> think<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.100> deciding

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
with smartwatches i think the deciding

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.040 
with smartwatches i think the deciding
factor<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.240> be<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.420> price<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.900> them

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
factor is going to be the price of them

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.110 
factor is going to be the price of them
