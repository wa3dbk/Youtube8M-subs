00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.170
 a large capacity of working width 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.860
 of 32 meters cut by section an engine 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.219
 of 153 hp a tank capacity of 3 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.619
 thousand 750 liters integrating all this 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.949
 system an autopilot the metalfor 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.289
 70 40 manages to work more than 400 per day 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.089
 hectares and then on agro tv te 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.710
 we present it directly working 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:32.540
 in a sweet stream field the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.030
 demands of the coming agriculture 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.300
 they require spray equipment that 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.969
 can be agile with power and width 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.940
 of labor but also sustainable to 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.489
 from precision devices with 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.489
 these qualities among your objectives a 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.359
 metal ford launched the model last year 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.519
 70 40 basically the strategy that had 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.249
 metalfor with respect to this machine with 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.309
 front engine was differentiated in the 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:04.519
 market with one more engine machine 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.900
 large with better distribution of weights and 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.310
 make a difference with the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.590
 other machines we had been doing for years 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.060
 previous ones that were with engines in the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.049
 medium 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.360
 the machine is in the market 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.640
 approximately for a year or a 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.250
 year and fraction and has had a very good 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.229
 acceptance here in this northern area the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.850
 buenos aires press there are between 8 and 10 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.619
 machines in the course of this year 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.759
 they have very good benefits 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.890
 the machine that we are seeing behind 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.220
 our one machine that has 6 months and 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.429
 almost 25,000 hectares worked and the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.929
 true that both the client and the 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.549
 factory engineers who come 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.020
 Periodically check the machine 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.509
 they are very satisfied with the performance of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.369
 the same as it was designed at 70 40 and 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.049
 what is the technological integration that 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.539
 they have in their spray system 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.610
 for a while now this part metaphor 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.649
 is designing the cabins has been formed 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.569
 a special department for that is 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.580
 supported on rubber blocks the filter of 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.709
 Activated carbon runs non-mica cargo 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.599
 as you saw in a wide cabin 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.670
 where two people can enter well 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.590
 that a very good armed visibility 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.319
 basically in what is system 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.110
 spray with a banderillero with 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.849
 mapper with an autopilot 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.799
 hydraulic that works on the system 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.630
 of hydraulic valves and gives you more 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.090
 precision and a cut by sections 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.780
 automatic that makes you represent 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.790
 to the client 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 a significant saving of products when 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.020
 they are working and they have some over 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.290
 of what is the polarization line 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.630
 is armed with ticket electrovalves 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.580
 It has a quintuple beaks at 35 and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.440
 simple to 52 to make fertilizer 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.450
 All liquid with anti-drip system 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.819
 They have hydraulic agitators inside 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.140
 the machine agitators type venture the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.209
 true that that has given a good result 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.770
 and it gives reliability to the client to the 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.300
 time to load the products which is the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.010
 width of labor that this great 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.620
 barral and what materials is 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.769
 made the bar that we 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.320
 we developed three years ago already has a 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.540
 Labor width of 32 meters was modified 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.489
 a bit the structure issue of the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.890
 bar we used to do it before 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.100
 square pipe and today it is becoming 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.500
 a round tube that produced or facilitated 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.680
 that the bar is lighter has almost 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.870
 300 kilos less in weight and provides 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.239
 greater stability at work time 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.970
 At the time of shopping you can choose 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.159
 between two sun engine marks me 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.400
 describe the characteristics of the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.349
 motorization and transmission us 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.000
 in this type of machines we are already 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.190
 arming with two types of engines with 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 deutsche and with cumming that's up to choice 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.430
 of the client in this type of machine the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.489
 what we are seeing has an engine 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.470
 cummins of 153 hp the transmission is a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.360
 mechanical transmission we have not done this 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.819
 type of hydrostatic machines have a 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.849
 engine told you cummins engine with the box 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.730
 and ton of fifth and a differential and ton 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.430
 high and low rolling is a roll 46 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.989
 two thousand 446 high flotation is a very 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.049
 good shot gives a very good clearance 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.480
 the machine and the reality is that brand 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.730
 very little the past in a field with 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.590
 humidity what we deal with this kind of 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.750
 machine is to try to distribute better the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.940
 weight since the weight of the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.590
 tank with the weight of the engine and the cabin 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.459
 in the middle then it makes you more 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.900
 panoramic and in turn makes it 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.579
 manga have better distributed the price 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.010
 work in a better way at the same time 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.299
 hollowing line sows 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.450
 people want more and more width of 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.100
 work 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.690
 that's why you choose in this type of 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.560
 machines because of the width of work 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.090
 the amount of work hours 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.910
 we are usually talking about 40 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.770
 hectares the hour approximately this 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.600
 machine has banderillero with mapper 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.100
 autopilot and section cut 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.540
 automatic what are the plans of 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.670
 financing that they are doing 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.500
 effective and that carry from the company 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.300
 to the producer to get this good from 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.370
 capital what we are working today 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.650
 from the factory is the credit line of the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.830
 nation bank and some kind of 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.780
 factory financing for three years with 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.780
 the first two fixed in pesos and the 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.700
 last year in kilos of soybeans and leave it 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.340
 stipulated and the customer can opt 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.060
 of paying with the physical merchandise or with 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.160
 money only exposes me the challenges of the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.620
 company and conveys the pride that 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.650
 represents a machine designed from 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.060
 of the user's needs the width 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.560
 of work in the machines will do each 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.240
 then larger then the factories 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.710
 we have to develop products that 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.390
 give better benefits to customers 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.650
 for which we are a long time ago 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.689
 of metalfor to these machines is a 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.449
 pride because 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.649
 It was designed entirely in the factory 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.619
 added the theme of cabins like you 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:29.929
 commented and the truth that the user will 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:31.610
 of a very good response and that is 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:34.159
 grateful with the machine that one 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.369
 sold the truth that is reason for 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.369
 pride
