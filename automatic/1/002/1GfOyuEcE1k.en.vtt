00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 of an inch and a half that are about 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.580
 four centimeters is where we will fix 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.220
 where to nail we have 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.510
 the columns this simply 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.850
 We like to be the weight and we will do it to 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.010
 a distance of about four centimeters 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.610
 in my case we are going to put four 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.610
 Let's see 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.279
 forgive with nerves has happened that 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.290
 before doing the columns we have to 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.989
 fix what we have to fix the cake to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.210
 the personal base then we're going to 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.420
 do with the pegs of 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 fixing the wooden ones in this case 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.989
 then for it 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.730
 in this case we are going to put two also 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.350
 equidistant to about four centimeters 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 of the brand that I have made 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 I have nailed it and now flush happened the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.340
 edible ink ball pen 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.290
 The sacks 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.450
 and at cost 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.870
 you are going to take another 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.159
 we do the same length 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.719
 we nail them normally they always 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.719
 I put them in opposition 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.830
 this is not very difficult then now 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.170
 already yes that we go with the columns this goes 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 to hold the weight of two tracks that go 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.410
 up as I said 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.410
 and let's know 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.130
 the column does not have to nail the envelope 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.020
 base simply has to support the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.400
 base 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.400
 we also mark 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.130
 we took out 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.140
 in diameter I always put columns of 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.569
 this day in this rosary and what it is 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.020
 lower I usually use what is the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.020
 spike 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.110
 a wooden stick
