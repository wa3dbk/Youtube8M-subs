00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
quite there yet they were about halfway

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
quite there yet they were about halfway
there<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.789> looked<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.539> little

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
there and I looked for little

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
there and I looked for little
intersections<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.190> grows<00:00:56.370> really

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
intersections you know what grows really

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.479 
intersections you know what grows really
key<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.329> me<00:00:57.480> were<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> points<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.859> corners

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
key for me were the points and corners

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
key for me were the points and corners
halfway<00:01:00.480> between<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> spawning<00:01:01.260> coves<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
what I'm really talking about our gravel

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.109 
what I'm really talking about our gravel
beds<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.770> importantly<00:01:14.220> mussel<00:01:15.000> beds

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
beds but more importantly mussel beds

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539 
beds but more importantly mussel beds
you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.259> they've<00:01:16.619> got<00:01:16.650> muscles<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you know and they've got muscles that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
you know and they've got muscles that
are<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> them<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.689> 78<00:01:19.350> inches<00:01:19.650> big<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
are some of them are 78 inches big and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249 
are some of them are 78 inches big and
they<00:01:20.850> cluster<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> groups<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.110> make

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
they cluster up in groups and they make

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.039 
they cluster up in groups and they make
little<00:01:22.650> tiny<00:01:22.890> mouths<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.720> top<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.930> those

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
little tiny mouths on top of those

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.289 
little tiny mouths on top of those
muscles<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.189> had<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> lot<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> times<00:01:27.060> an

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
muscles you had a lot of times an

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
muscles you had a lot of times an
isolated<00:01:27.990> piece<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.259> cover<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.770> lone<00:01:29.460> stump

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
isolated piece of cover a lone stump

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.319 
isolated piece of cover a lone stump
alone<00:01:30.479> rock<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.650> branch<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:33.090> where

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
alone rock one branch and that's where

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
alone rock one branch and that's where
the<00:01:33.450> fish<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.900> grouped<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.320> I've<00:01:35.009> never

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the fish would be grouped up I've never

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
the fish would be grouped up I've never
seen<00:01:35.400> fish<00:01:35.909> grouped<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
seen fish grouped up like that was

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560 
seen fish grouped up like that was
amazing<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.250> four<00:01:38.939> days<00:01:39.119> turned

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
amazing I think in four days turned

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
amazing I think in four days turned
efficient<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.229> probably<00:01:40.890> caught<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.189> over<00:01:41.369> five

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
efficient I probably caught it over five

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
efficient I probably caught it over five
or<00:01:41.790> six<00:01:41.970> hundred<00:01:42.030> bass<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.530> times<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
or six hundred bass a lot of times it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.730 
or six hundred bass a lot of times it
was<00:01:43.920> every<00:01:44.460> cast<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.170> key<00:01:46.470> bait

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
was every cast you know the key bait

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.460 
was every cast you know the key bait
