 surface rt is very useful at work. 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:45.200
 os rt installed on surface rt 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.620
 Free from windows store at windows rt 8.1 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.800
 Can be updated 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.290
 Already a successor to surface rt 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.340
 surface 2 has been released, but even the first surface rt 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:05.560

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.250

 Although onenote microsoft office rt is included 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.700
 Microsoft office by updating to windows rt 8.1 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.580
 Updated to 2013 rt 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.920
 And 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:35.860
 I outlook of mail sending and receiving software is added 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.860
 You can do other operations while downloading 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.550
 Press here to go back 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.550
 Wait for the download to complete 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:58.659

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.659

 Azoso This video is editing 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.110
 Prepared to deal This update took about but do not do terribly 3 hours 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.630
 It is the second of REBOOT 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.459
 Speaking of which I have not backed up anything 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:34.560
 Well surface rt is different from normal windows 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:40.210
 Because I can not install applications other than windows store 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:44.490
 I think updates will proceed without problems 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.610
 After the device is ready 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.960
 applying pc settings 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:58.560

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:02.130

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:07.750
 Tap the button you set yourself 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:14.800
 If you do not understand the meaning , you can only tap Use Easy Settings 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:22.090
 The purpose is to control information that you do not want to take, but why is information taken ? 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:26.220
 In order to use conveniently, convenience and security are inversely proportional, so do you decide the amount by yourself? 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.220
 It will be decided by microsoft 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:39.260
 Should it be changed later if you need wonder if do is such a thing 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:45.930
 Oh yeah this account is used by a local account 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:50.670
 I showed you at first but I usually sign in with my picture password 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.590
 So I only use local accounts 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.670

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:27.860
 I'd like to sign out when there is no need to sign in only when you use only 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:31.039
 You have entered the microsoft account because it can not be helped 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.040

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:39.700

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.430

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.270
 By the way, this colorful background work is performed for each account 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.539

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:14.969
