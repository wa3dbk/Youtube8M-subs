00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.780
 the good channel today I bring you a video 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.930
 also like this, you can quickly 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.689
 good prices are from mercadona like 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.610
 you can see in the title and good 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.360
 they are really very little 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.119
 things and are more things good then of 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:32.250
 cremita if such a cosmetic voucher 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 so then I'm going to start and nothing 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.010
 first 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.350
 I took my urea moisturizer that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.890
 I use enough is what I most 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.909
 moisturizes and well I like it very much brings 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.739
 5% pure urea and nothing puts 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.510
 restores the hydration level of the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.039
 very dry skin repairs intensely 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 providing a sense of comfort 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.399
 immediately the truth is that I like 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.729
 very much 3 400 milliliters and good this 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.789
 true cream really moisturizes 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.590
 enough since if you do the facts where to 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.530
 next day after showering and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.119
 then you shower the next day 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 you are perfectly as they have the cream 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.430
 it is still worth then to me this cream me 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.540
 love 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 following with the creampie I also fucked 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.510
 my argan moisturizer that I 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.550
 love how it smells and smells 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.040
 great and good I'm in love 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.840
 this cream of urea is true for 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 my taste that moisturizes more but this has 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.210
 a smell that does not have the other and I 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.920
 love also brings 200 milliliters brings 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.160
 Half as good as the other 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.430
 a lot and I like a lot I also took 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.560
 the body moisturizer of luminosity 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.440
 As you know, well, there are 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.049
 I brought back before this came as 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.969
 slightly smaller format 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.430
 but they removed it because of the problem 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.880
 there was with the creams and such 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.440
 mercadona and good brings 200 milliliters 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.860
 same and leaves a very precious color 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.470
 I do not know if there you can appreciate 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.819
 the flashes that you leave golden brown 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.060
 what is wonderful but wonderful 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:26.349
 good to continue with bathing things in 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.410
 First place is decided to try the gel 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:34.000
 also argan 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.310
 It has 500 milliliters and it's true 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.950
 that when 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.190
 you open it and smell it, it smells 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.980
 little bit but then once you have 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.170
 you do not smell anything like cream 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.150
 the truth is that in that aspect more 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.090
 exceptional enough because neither does 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.010
 it has a smell very much there that we say but 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.950
 What I really like is that it's very 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.560
 moisturizer is a very dense gel that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.920
 a little bit , it's a lot because it 's 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.769
 very very dense and in that sense the truth 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.620
 is that I liked it so much that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.549
 I do not know if it will be repeated or not but 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.250
 well for now I 'm going to follow 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.410
 Well now we went to the hair I was going to 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.200
 catch my liquid gold shampoo that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.780
 you know what I'm using and 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.110
 I'm doing very well since I tried it on 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.780
 what I am using and I love 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.569
 brings 400 milliliters of argan oil 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.430
 young keratin so not all good 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.290
 Well, it leaves my hair but also 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.360
 that has a smell is great it leaves me the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.450
 good hair pretty hydrated for 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.670
 echoes that I have 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.120
 so nothing then I'll keep buying from 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.599
 the same line I use the mask have 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.290
 removed a mask for him is like a 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.430
 spray also for dry hair that is 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.709
 no rinse 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.860
 and well I'll try it later because 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.130
 at the moment with this I am doing well so 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.349
 nothing is 3 200 milliliters and well 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.930
 of the same line or superbly and 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.300
 well I'm repeating with them and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.110
 now cleaning 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.180
 I use maquillan t oil this is the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.820
 second boat and as you can see he took it 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.220
 here it brings 240 milliliters and generates 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.110
 cellular regenerator maquillan oil 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.120
 you clean makeup moisturizes face 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.860
 eyes and lips with gold particles to 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.189
 dry skin 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.580
 what I love this water cleaner 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:37.229
 micellar of mercadona at the moment if the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.229
 micellar water that was what used the 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.650
 moment left it parked because with 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.020
 of this there are people who will fare well me 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.000
 give him a bad but I certainly 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.069
 is very fast I have the 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.979
 eyes that you know that also problems of 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.319
 dermatitis in the eyelids I have it 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.840
 super homes that abuse I think 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.960
 that by not using cottons or anything 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.129
 Well, it helps me not to dry that 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.169
 area and also to have the skin then dry 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.509
 the truth is that it hydrates her 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.930
 Super fast makeup in two seconds 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.840
 with a little water and that's it 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.660
 even the toughest makeups the most 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.360
 resistant and the most loaded the 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.970
 you immediately eliminate another thing with the 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.680
 that I repeated again because I love and 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.020
 I will continue repeating exaggerated encounter 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.449
 another one better in the test makes facial 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.580
 minimizes the pores of the truth is that 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.580
 I'm going great this I do not know if it's my second 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.580
 my third boat 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.470
 ok and you have a review about it in the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.020
 blog that I 'm going to leave in the little box 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.490
 information because the truth I am 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.849
 delighted with her and I have not tried other 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.740
 tests that I like so much and finally 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.889
 the only little thing of makeup that 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.280
 I caught was one of the lipsticks over 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.889
 new ones that have taken out that is the number 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.999
 14 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.529
 is a very coral coral tone forgiveness color 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:06.319
 roof tile 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:10.219
 and had many great to have a color 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.779
 well for the time you enter and so 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.740
 leave a little then of the colors 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:18.060
 usual is that color 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.060
 It is a tile color 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.060
 I find it beautiful and it covers super well 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.400
 you know that this is the pot list of 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.040
 wise I say this and these lipsticks 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.380
 they love the lipsticks more than mercadona 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.240
 and good girls because those have been the 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.670
 full of mercadona as you see it very 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.800
 delicated are basic things neighbor 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.000
 removing the tests and the labial that are 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.390
 more things 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.880
