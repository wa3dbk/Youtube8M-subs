00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.179 

this<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.090> hear<00:01:39.360> oh<00:01:39.829> there's<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
this one I can hear oh there's just a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
this one I can hear oh there's just a
ghost<00:01:41.430> there's<00:01:41.969> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.329> ghost<00:01:42.509> tone<00:01:42.840> just

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

barely<00:01:43.469> in<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:44.990> which<00:01:45.990> leads<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
barely in there which leads me to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.100 
barely in there which leads me to
believe<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.759> perhaps<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.360> somewhere<00:01:48.930> on

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
believe that perhaps the somewhere on

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.950 
believe that perhaps the somewhere on
this<00:01:49.289> horn<00:01:49.560> there's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.920> better<00:01:50.360> altissimo<00:01:51.360> mt

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I'll find it eventually but so there's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.860 
I'll find it eventually but so there's
two<00:02:00.439> have<00:02:01.439> fun<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.710> us
