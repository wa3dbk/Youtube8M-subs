00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.680
 the second part of the dragon attack all also 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.870
 the same dragons 3 level 11 pieces 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 me a kamlakas whether another dragon 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.839
 a queen herself 2 sang health and one 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.720
 the ravich is 9 t x he has four rdf 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.859
 and one of them apaets three of them 6 leyla 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.560
 and I decided to take advantage of this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 two of them are pretty close and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 first task of course number one 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 take down the next rdf here these 2 things well 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.600
 and the top most likely I will demolish 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.469
 royal so releasing all their 12 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 dragons and with ripe I'm here of course 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.840
 wise the boats on the dragon raid and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 the main group flew to another 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.890
 The side is ripe, but I threw it at all 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.449
 sang at all could not touch in this attack 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 confused as I thought that they were all the same 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.410
 here now should turn up here 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.329
 an hour they go into this file and nifiga 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.600
 more me okay right group 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 only hilitsya and everything in general in general 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.930
 spells could be here in this same not 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.479
 touch i would snes it and i still not 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 I take down the top rdf because that's just 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.119
 now till you see the bow tower better 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.720
 first distracted by dragons and for 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.990
 that my queen is very fast not 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.200
 killed just now here she runs up and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.009
 clearly demolishes this top rdf gave 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 a little battered mother dragons but so 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.799
 bows you switched to see him 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.390
 the queen fulfilled her mission 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.880
 destroyed rdf 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.229
 and died immediately if still connected 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.479
 to the tower of the archers then she would not have reached dr 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.460
 defo and most likely I would be on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.310
 would stop at this mordahi no further 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.070
 I went and so and so I will demolish the base for everything 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.399
 100 percent and ben here sang sorry 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.079
 I just had time to watch j-th fluorine and 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:03.250
 I sang and of course I just fused 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.640
 say nowhere 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.680
 yes there are such failures and sometimes 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.150
 sometimes you get lost and can not 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.880
 predict the action of these dragons 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.140
 what the dragons like said my glass hens 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.970
 still those and not always easy to predict them 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.270
 actions would seem to be coming 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 dispensation no they still react by 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.050
 different reasons for something else 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.020
 Of course , not without luck, let's say it was 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.930
 failures will show you now 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.050
 interesting so he's 9 h4rd hash cost u 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.980
 I was interested in him too 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.710
 I needed a black and black elixir 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.480
 I need to put queens to 30 thousand 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.610
 black and only 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 and here we see two thousand units 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:55.010
 so I decided that basically I 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.240
 very easy to get to the vault and this 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.550
 was my main 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.050
 although I myself did not understand why I did so 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.960
 didn't get to him 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.640
 let's look look what was 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:12.410
 here the problem is what I like more 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.170
 rather do not like the reaction of dragons 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.630
 that they react to everything that moves along 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.780
 earth especially impending skeletons 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 below here's the minus that's just 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.120
 reached the corner 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.290
 demolished rdf and black just refused 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.220
 take from just one dragon flew a couple 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.870
 exhaust made his own and all 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.330
 scattered instantly to other parties 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.640
 why they demolished 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.250
 Here you yourself saw in the corners carried to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.070
 This rdf and in the near was just the same 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.330
 and vault black lexer and they flew 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.640
 left and right to more other buildings 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.170
 that stand on the cell here 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.489
 I can't understand this at all 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.290
 absolutely here are chickens looking for those i was very 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.090
 angry 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.820
 what I spent so much elixir and 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.310
 nothing can be good that I sang not 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.709
 spent because this time I already 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.640
 thought no need to clearly you see be 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.400
 one hundred percent 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.530
 where they will fly here they would fly to 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.019
 Aleksa Ravan silent there I already threw 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.640
 another spell raid and so far at all 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.970
 honestly i think they will fly 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.900
 middle just scattered just just 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.690
 scattered in different directions and I'm not 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.600
 understand why honestly and one more 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.350
 very large tequila attack 474 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.590
 gold 425 elixir and as many as 3000 black 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.230
 elixir it was already an attack after 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.020
 how i put queen coons you see 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.840
 just 914 of black elixir from me and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:54.050
 here we see 7 rd all 4 7 rdf with him and 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.780
 honestly, I confess to you there, well, not 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.970
 The first one is already on the farm. 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.860
 I remember here 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:07.460
 Bases where was the seventh rdf but then I went 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.520
 in the bank honestly spells could 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.440
 there was already taking only a rage 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.800
 was taking 4g and 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.919
 only this could save me because 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.770
 heal 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:23.030
 doesn't hold 5 at all 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.840
 saves practically from 7 rdf and he is very 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:30.290
 quickly destroy everything but I liked it 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.220
 the fact that I took all the black is already 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.950
 great advantage 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.410
 and half of the resources I also took and 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.470
 gold elixirs 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.690
 principle, that's it if you farm 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.050
 Dragons the precisely such bases 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.340
 which are completely clogged 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.430
 elixir and gold which many 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.169
 black and in principle yes let's say not 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.390
 scared i scared rdf 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.840
 and 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:06:00.730
 and what, in principle, it turned out not bad 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.940
 said i would say as many as 3,000 black to 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.920
 not bad and not on this all the more attack 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.630
 dragons will not be soon 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.520
 only if in whom and only if 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.410
 some interesting so they already tell me 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.560
 fed up with today so much 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.950
 a dragon was made and that's all 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.950
 until
