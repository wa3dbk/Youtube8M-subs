which<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.959> don't<00:02:59.080> seem<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.910> agriculture<00:03:00.910> if

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
which we don't seem so agriculture if

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you're going to be an inflation boo i

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.809 
you're going to be an inflation boo i
would<00:03:04.360> say<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.540> agriculture<00:03:05.290> remains

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
would say that agriculture remains

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.520 
would say that agriculture remains
distinct<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:06.910> remains<00:03:07.390> distinctly<00:03:08.049> cheap
