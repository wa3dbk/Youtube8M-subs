00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.410
 hello everyone on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.020
 show the hydrogen system and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.260
 oxygen on demand installed in a 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:18.840
 mitsubishi montero 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.790
 this xls a year 2001 motor this 3500 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.460
 in this vehicle as in all 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.250
 pointers we have installed the cell in the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.640
 lower part 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.859
 you can see the production 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.519
 in the lower part where he receives the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.519
 cooling 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.239
 and here we are giving the cell to your 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.900
 town as if we see it up here 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.760
 we can see there to production 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.890
 1 from the entrance of the water to the other one of the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 output of the gases that eventually 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.710
 let's get here we have the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 production 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.200
 ok here we have then the tank where 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 we store the distilled water and 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.480
 we collect the gases eventually that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.260
 we send it to good to this in this case 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 it is a reserve that keeps around 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.050
 about two and a half liters of hh for 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.690
 use it in this accelerations here 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.730
 we have the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.450
 and what do we have 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.450
 So happy 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 to accelerate it then to see 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.960
 how it behaves in this book here 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 case we accelerate it we have 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880
 but 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 and there we can notice that revolutions 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.150
 tall 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.440
 they get more hydrogen than normal 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.310
 due to this reservation 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.170
 it's here this side we have the amperage 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.030
 you can see well that they work about 15 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.030
