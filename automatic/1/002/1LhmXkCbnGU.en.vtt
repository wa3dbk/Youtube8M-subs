00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.340
 I started the g27 again at the start and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.960
 first of all a big thank you to the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 Utah the argument that I'm here the gas 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.250
 Comments I am allowed to tear 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.170
 as the third winner of the audi cup 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.090
 Submitted later and is therefore the reason mp3 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.090
 also fell bootleg and the gameplay is 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.030
 you could not have said it more beautiful 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.739
 Thank you for the further duck 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 But we come to the actual topic 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 because I'm with you today 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.760
 little about the current situation 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.610
 talk to the gaming industry and that is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.470
 really nothing for the faint of heart 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 it all depends on the free 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.670
 to play play it really like that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.860
 Most cases are the starting point 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.829
 All bad for me, strictly speaking 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.780
 free to play a modernized game 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 form demos one has when you look at that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 play daun loads if ever the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.930
 half of the game ever in it and the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.430
 other flows and may purchase to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.990
 not like in the whole park and in the past 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 because of purchase of the full version but always 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.710
 in small snacks so goes here 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.869
 what everyone in the area is in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 cortina the area still the questreihe 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.470
 and so on, that's all 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.330
 I do not really have anything 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.520
 however, the problem is s.der thing 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 what this affects the free to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.049
 So he had a play model last year 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 They announced they will be a free-to-play 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.150
 manufacturer for that ever right 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.860
 fat thumb down 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.470
 honestly not if he is you or if 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 Battlefield 4 free to play will jump 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 I left the window they can 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.220
 Just do not bring because we come 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.170
 what is ea together is meanwhile too 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.460
 really bad 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.320
 has said to that and indeed they have 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 to work as ps3 introduced that one 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.509
 buy for real money resources 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.189
 can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.270
 dion with which you can build better weapons 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.470
 somehow so i have got difficult 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.009
 played but so has been reported so 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.189
 So the space 3 full-price title 60 days 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.640
 that then you can buy something else 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.960
 can because of optical skins or DLCs 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.020
 to which we are still the same 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.700
 Okay, but that's it then 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.880
 can build better weapons 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.910
 hello page brings quite big the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.150
 understood that exactly the keyword for ea 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.350
 has announced the last days 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.310
 We noticed that came with the fans 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.620
 good at 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.670
 just the very, very short was very briefly 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.920
 the fans play a game for 60 euros 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.900
 buy and then continue for it 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.520
 spend money so that you do not spend so long 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.210
 has to play and so you have faster 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.250
 and gets better 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.610
 I really want to see the fans 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.170
 how the celebration can say please 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.090
 rather that always money rummage volt 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.420
 okay that's the case, I can 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.450
 Although to a certain extent understand 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.340
 that you from any company but so 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.330
 and that's why they have announced now 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.890
 all right 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.030
 We will always do that in the future 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.150
 that's how you should be in the whole next one 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.820
 play by the parents which extra weapons 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.240
 buy extra vehicles whatever 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.620
 should 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.260
 we've already got that one 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 So palin understood in free to play game 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.180
 a certain existence entitlement however 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.280
 in full-price titles that's possible at all 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.660
 not without joke absolute no-go like that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.990
 I've just grown the theme 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.440
 dlc it was also nice so earlier called 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.030
 it still addons because then came so very thick 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.710
 Klop out of what's handy and as well 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.860
 often as own games nevertheless 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.650
 My husband was watching her again 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.300
 example could be general of 2000 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.450
 what do i know it was a flop 1 or so 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.820
 then you can go extensions I think 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.250
 hour zero was the name of the guys that was 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.120
 it is also right nowadays they work out 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.360
 example oblivion enters for ten euros 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.890
 clear from everything 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.830
 I have to say role-playing games 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.810
 then there are the dlcs in 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.510
 in a sense still addons was best 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.630
 example right here so that we 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.870
 really acceptable dlcs but if 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.810
 I look at action-playing people 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.290
 was not really an arms pack 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.030
 With 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.239
 the weapons or something for one 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.430
 never quite a few euros and that comes 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.690
 yes even from these shitty free to 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.650
 play play because you have noticed so 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.360
 High Come and let a few 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.860
 install the microtransactions 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.570
 any people buy that 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.340
 and then we just take that one 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.210
 content previously out of the game then 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.740
 we do not have to do it extra 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.600
 I program the developers 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.530
 are already so far the plan from the beginning 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.600
 on a 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.340
 jo all right now we do soundso 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.470
 many dlcs that will still be during that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.470
 is developed from the beginning with the 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.120
 dlcs and mass effect then like 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.669
 again struck out from the actual 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.669
 game that you can buy extra because 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.639
 then no question but the big one 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.889
 whole shit with distance the consoles 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.780
 oh now the konsoleros but on 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.729
 i stood as a pc player but i got there 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.849
 the ass card pulled because the consoles 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.050
 so keep so everything on it is 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.349
 incredible 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.750
 It starts with the menus are all 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.330
 meanwhile designed on controller 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.740
 So with a billion under menus 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.840
 and somewhere else nested 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.970
 and so with the controller use too 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.620
 operate but mouse and keyboard off 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.289
 sunday kramp you can tell the people 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.630
 do not do anything that goes on with the 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.120
 Control Assassin's creed is running 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.990
 wonderful on the controller and nothing 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.560
 problem 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.580
 at the pc nothing that would have felt the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.990
 I have you playing with max 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.020
 price controls but as really so bad 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.199
 but now comes the naughtiest yes that 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.590
 porting for the pc it's enough 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.479
 developers no longer 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.370
 I already know what a promise so mÃ¼nch 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.349
 is like double legendary 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.930
 to deliver where really and me 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:57.010
 Exaggerate at this point not the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.539
 Sound is not the control I do 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.909
 nothing i just stand around in the room 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.800
 the guard back from a corner of the 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.900
 I'm in the other screen 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.840
 play something single mistake no the 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.360
 whole team discussion but the social 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.009
 lifted it so that any complaints which 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.270
 is with the developers the opportunities 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.320
 and do not even knock that 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.139
 announced free dlc to sky ahead 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.300

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.509
 People who arrive and say now 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:29.210

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.340

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.150
 dear double o seven levinson graphic 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:46.219
 from 1990 yes that is also a point 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.419
 at the consoles we have to 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:52.610
 Not to mention that you are actually all 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:54.289
 be clear and a control portier so 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.789
