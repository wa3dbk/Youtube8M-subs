00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.720
 what's up with people like this I hope that 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.780
 are very well today I am going to 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.670
 teach some secretillos a curiosity 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.980
 is that I found them quite 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.050
 interesting here on the mold map 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.690
 then well then and some 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.950
 students with the first good the first 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.020
 that I am going to teach you there is 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.630
 It seemed quite interesting, not if you 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.760
 you grab and put 115 that for those who do not 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.520
 know 315 is like the element of the 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.410
 zombies and this borrowed generate around 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.289
 to 115 who black ops 2 and kilos where 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.670
 not so good if you put 115 in the 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.530
 counter where they are like the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.990
 scales of conch and then inside 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 will you if you put 115 hear what 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.640
 will happen or that will impose a lot of attention 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.239
 finish this month 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 and well, as they could see there 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.530
 when you put 115 grabs and says how 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.080
 a half satanic voice says maybe next 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.480
 time not and then the counter starts 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.960
 change now the counter stops 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.460
 coincidentally in 666 as for a second 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.670
 as well as a second and a half stops 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.440
 in 666 and then everything is changed to zero not 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.880
 two good also as interesting good 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.050
 this part because as it solves a 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.150
 little doubt of who is 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.070
 controlling the zombies that what fart 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.960
 with this mother, and as I had already 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.060
 said when we analyze all the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.350
 audios in spanish that these times 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.000
 they are already dead and being like 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.130
 hell and that's why I do not have 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.750
 much relation to the maps of the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.850
 other maps do not and that they are like those 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.410
 like part zombies are like zombies 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.509
 different as I do not know if they are zombies 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.759
 controlled by some demon by the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.490
 devil, not me, I know, not just 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.500
 as pure evil as well as they are 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.140
 zombies because they contradict themselves 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.729
 as magicians and yes, but be sure 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.310
 I say that there is something like more behind 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.350
 big and right now with this that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.539
 wants to put 115 and grab and says the voice 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.860
 satanic this maybe next time not that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.840
 it would be something like maybe next 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.590
 all time then it's like saying like that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.780
 what 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.670
 are being controlled by 115 and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.649
 then he walks 666 and well then 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.229
 you can imagine and well we go with the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.030
 next this happens if we bring a slider 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.009
 and we are going to draw some already 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.239
 know some do not know and well 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.340
 I'm going to show you what I'm going to leave 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.780
 run the video this the little bit this 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.170
 so that see more to see if right now 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.170
 we comment 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.930
 how they saw the crazy image of the crazy 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.610
 it's like a child I do not know what but it's not the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.740
 first time I saw him and pulled out a pelis 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.240
 our mother has to stick with this 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.340
 norm means I already knew that I would leave 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.110
 that mother but I do not know how that like 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.630
 hit me with a sustillo if I said that 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.730
 operate or victim of how it impacts you 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.890
 in the negritos of locarno bitch this is 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.140
 as one of those and serge hits and they 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.850
 that they put this map on himself I say that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.310
 more than anything for curious pennies there 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.140
 where to look for secrets and so if it happens to you 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000
 point exactly where are the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.740
 fireworks from the roof that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.120
 is going to be a fucking good face see there you 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.400
 they are going to scream for you to scare 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.320
 then just as a control not from 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.150
 three blamed the return of trolas 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.560
 so good if you want to take a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.510
 substitute then go to the roof and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.980
 point and with a sniper to the fires 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.380
 artificial funds so that it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.330
 get a good scare ask us next 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.580
 the following is a pretty interesting 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.310
 and this audio that I got is pretty 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.610
 good because we can hear clearly 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.610
 as 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.709
 arlington like the weasel that is like 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.170
 key on this map not the lic or the others 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.970
 characters like the key was samuel 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.060
 not that he is the one who listens straight 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.060
 make us zombie flesh the mother does not 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.860
 then be here, tell me if it is 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.590
 the arlington and in the weasel or 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.230
 arlington this as it's apparently like 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.970
 listening to the voices of nicolás he has 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.690
 as very marked the name of nicola and 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.950
 in the mind 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.760
 let's listen to this little fragment 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.760
 to see 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.069
 and as good as and heard that 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.080
 little fragment that says it but 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.120
 begins to say nicolás nicoláy because 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.740
 I keep hearing that name is not for 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.810
 those who do not know nicholas was one of 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.980
 our main characters or the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.740
 characters rather the first 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.000
 originals in black ops 1 this before no 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.790
 there were those who are now 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.800
 this like four pinches delicious but 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.720
 these requirements all love them and all 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.610
 they want them then this good 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.260
 coincidentally this bastard has like very 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.060
 put the name of nicola and says with 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.290
 that you listen to it and as of why it continues 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.639
 listening to the name you can not 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.709
 then maybe there is a certain 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.410
 relationship that we do not yet know what 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.080
 better after it cleared west or something like that 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.720
 no and nicola is as involved or by 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.190
 what the hell this one has arlington usa 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.050
 like the idea of nico the goddess because 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.390
 has like nicole's name there's very 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.890
 stuck in the mind and very this one like that 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.480
 very nailed is enough 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.550
 interesting but good, well, it will be 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.430
 see in yes futures to see if something comes out 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.229
 more than one is this story with the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.570
 others because right now I think there's no 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.490
 nothing like concrete that we say is 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.320
 that this is the link between this and this one 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.260
 but let's go back to the last one 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.730
 I wanted to teach with the ramp 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.170
 let's see where the puppy is 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.420
 where we have to feed him to 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.250
 let's unlock the tomahawk this 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.570
 let's go if we leave as one of the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.250
 corners on the left side of the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.440
 right does not matter of the two parties it 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.210
 see they simply have to duck 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.670
 and look down there we can see there's 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.080
 as lava not then good this follows 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.910
 the strength not the idea that these guys 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950
 they are dead and they are in hell 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.810
 or something like that and that's why the bird on the map does not 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.180
 when the important thing here is that you grab 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.250
 milestone you grab and you inhabit a grenade this one 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.380
 like the lava eats it and gives you 20 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.240
 points then as managers and 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.590
 bernal habits if you get 20 points 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.750
 then and this can be done by each 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.630
 round will obviously be more than 35 degrees 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.760
 not unless you get a former master of 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.830
 You would earn 100 points per round but then 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.560
 I say there are times you say do not nurse this 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.520
 10 points to buy something the yogurt does not 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.230
 or whatever 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.540
 then good look at small option 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.880
 because they are missing as 10 20 points then 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.950
 something that will hold onto your bait for 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.660
 that is to give them 20 points not 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.180
 I say something is something and then these little ones 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.680
 Pretty simple tricks finish 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.660
 buying non-Ghent yogurt or 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.160
 things like that very simple but good this 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.290
 we will be all the secreillos that 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.040
 found this right now if I find 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.200
 something more interesting 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.730
 other things that says this is chingón 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.670
 but you know that I just uploaded them 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.700
 I comment and he warns them so they know 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.070
 but well I say goodbye 607 see you 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.070
 think a lot follow me on twitter at 10
