00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
now so and now we just jump straight

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.200 
now so and now we just jump straight
into<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.390> video<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.980> I'm<00:00:37.370> something<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:37.940> test

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
into the video and I'm something to test

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.700 
into the video and I'm something to test
a<00:00:39.460> vacancy<00:00:40.460> it's<00:00:41.030> gonna<00:00:41.450> be<00:00:41.690> give<00:00:41.870> it<00:00:41.990> a<00:00:42.110> bit<00:00:42.680> of

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
a vacancy it's gonna be give it a bit of

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.580 
a vacancy it's gonna be give it a bit of
different<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.340> lay<00:00:43.550> out<00:00:43.580> some<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:46.330> I<00:00:47.590> think

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
different you lay out some and I think

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.290 
different you lay out some and I think
it's<00:00:48.710> orphan<00:00:49.250> proves<00:00:49.550> like<00:00:49.880> some<00:00:50.180> of<00:00:50.240> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
it's orphan proves like some of the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.380 
it's orphan proves like some of the
tests<00:00:50.630> you<00:00:50.690> can<00:00:50.780> run<00:00:50.960> on<00:00:51.230> its<00:00:51.410> own<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.390> I'm

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
tests you can run on its own and I'm

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.070 
tests you can run on its own and I'm
just<00:00:53.570> go<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.810> test<00:00:54.530> again<00:00:55.600> these<00:00:56.600> are<00:00:56.660> all<00:00:56.900> the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
just go to test again these are all the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.490 
just go to test again these are all the
tests<00:00:57.290> will<00:00:57.410> run<00:00:57.650> run<00:00:58.460> cpu<00:00:59.000> memory<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.720> 2d

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
tests will run run cpu memory a 2d

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.010 
tests will run run cpu memory a 2d
graphics<00:01:01.010> 3d<00:01:01.430> graphics<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.930> they<00:01:03.410> face<00:01:05.020> IQ

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020

think<00:01:06.350> us<00:01:06.549> 13<00:01:07.630> device<00:01:08.630> 10<00:01:09.189> and<00:01:10.189> SD<00:01:10.939> card<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.950> 45

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
think us 13 device 10 and SD card and 45

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.099 
think us 13 device 10 and SD card and 45
scored<00:01:13.479> point<00:01:14.479> out<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.719> time<00:01:14.960> yeah<00:01:16.899> just<00:01:17.899> an

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
scored point out of time yeah just an

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.559 
scored point out of time yeah just an
option<00:01:18.229> on<00:01:18.499> the<00:01:18.619> track<00:01:18.829> book<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.490> will<00:01:20.240> not<00:01:20.359> last

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
option on the track book I will not last

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:29.279 
option on the track book I will not last
so<00:01:20.780> yeah<00:01:21.609> you<00:01:22.609> better<00:01:22.850> be<00:01:23.390> able<00:01:24.020> see

so<00:01:30.289> I'll<00:01:30.439> just<00:01:30.469> start<00:01:31.159> test<00:01:31.429> now<00:01:33.039> let<00:01:34.039> me<00:01:34.069> take

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
so I'll just start test now let me take

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.179 
so I'll just start test now let me take

let's<00:03:16.080> test<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.530> frame<00:03:16.770> raise<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.310> see

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
let's test the frame raise you can see

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.020 
let's test the frame raise you can see
56<00:03:18.270> 57

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.880 

d<00:03:26.030> 8<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.540> new<00:03:29.840> one<00:03:30.020> which<00:03:30.260> things<00:03:30.620> new
