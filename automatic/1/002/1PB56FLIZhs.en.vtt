difficult<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> wash

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
difficult to get at so we have to wash

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.960 
difficult to get at so we have to wash
our<00:01:31.409> hands<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.680> outside<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> sprays
