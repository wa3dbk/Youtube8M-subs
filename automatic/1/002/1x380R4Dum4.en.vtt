00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the wheels fell off what if this team is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
the wheels fell off what if this team is
just<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:57.000> last<00:00:57.210> year's<00:00:57.690> well

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

just the same as last year's well
slightly<00:00:58.680> improved<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.059> better

and<00:01:02.550> sometimes<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> means<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.899> goalies

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and sometimes that means your goalies

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.960 
and sometimes that means your goalies
got<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.500> completely<00:01:04.920> save<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.519> ass<00:01:05.640> and

for years alright we need to herd this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
for years alright we need to herd this
guy<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.110> five<00:01:43.380> years<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.860> another<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
guy up five years not another one the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.370 
guy up five years not another one the
season<00:01:45.210> still<00:01:45.479> young<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> looks<00:01:46.290> like

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
season still young but it looks like

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
season still young but it looks like
he's<00:01:46.649> arrived<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> perhaps<00:01:47.700> more

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
he's arrived and perhaps more

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
he's arrived and perhaps more
importantly<00:01:48.450> he<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> hero<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.680> group

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
importantly he can be a hero for a group

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
importantly he can be a hero for a group
of<00:01:50.100> hockey<00:01:50.369> fans<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.000> haven't<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.750> had

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of hockey fans that haven't really had

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.520 
of hockey fans that haven't really had
one<00:01:52.110> before

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
one before

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
one before
is<00:01:52.829> he<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.100> slow<00:01:53.399> down<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.640> bit<00:01:53.939> probably<00:01:54.630> his

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
is he gonna slow down a bit probably his

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450 
is he gonna slow down a bit probably his
shooting<00:01:55.079> percentage<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.799> too<00:01:55.950> high<00:01:56.189> he's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
shooting percentage is too high he's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
shooting percentage is too high he's
getting<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> right<00:01:57.149> bounces<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.200> it's

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
getting all the right bounces but it's

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.440 
getting all the right bounces but it's
still<00:01:58.799> good<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.340> he's<00:01:59.460> succeeding<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.119> with

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
still good that he's succeeding and with

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.580 
still good that he's succeeding and with
what<00:02:00.630> he's<00:02:00.719> been<00:02:00.899> through<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> past<00:02:01.320> couple

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
what he's been through the past couple

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.959 
what he's been through the past couple
seasons<00:02:01.740> he<00:02:02.070> probably<00:02:02.310> deserves<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.790> few

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
seasons he probably deserves a few

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.090 
seasons he probably deserves a few
bounces<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.509> Carlisle<00:02:03.930> after<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> game<00:02:04.680> cold
