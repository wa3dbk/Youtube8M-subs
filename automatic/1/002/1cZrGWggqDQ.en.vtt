00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.190
 i 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.500
 yes 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.889
 i 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.889
 and how many millions fall into an oven 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.410
 and sizes 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:30.040
 what we have the others does not fit 45 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.040
 thousands and the vote of 85 fits 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.960
 wood instead of oil the 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.070
 quality diminish us the quality not the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.460
 quality news what happens is that we go 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.489
 Finding how to get more out 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.989
 good material because as we have never 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.989
 burned with firewood 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 because he left that he marked in oil 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.690
 because it is no longer profitable for 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.210
 we the horneros because it comes out very 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.570
 expensive 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.740
 it's not very expensive 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.610
 the price and here those who come to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.900
 buy the ones from the cars pay us very 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 very cheap and it turns out that we have to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.310
 change this is another kind of fire like 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.150
 is the firewood so that our 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.119
 meetings 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 so the firewood car or they're going to 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:45.320
 pick up the law cars at once 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.930
 the car does not leave about eight thousand pesos 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.190
 others in 10,000 depends when the car 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.750
 boy the five thousand pesos and if it is a car 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.570
 big the torton nine thousand 8 thousand 3 and if 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.560
 it's a trailer because she comes as 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 15 or 16 thousand pesos and let's say 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.899
 that the process is what you 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.470
 fascinates of the process accepted but that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.420
 I like it because I do not like us 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.290
 like to do it for reasons that the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.459
 we have it here in the house 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:29.069
 we want more work is daily 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:31.430
 activate I want to do 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.569
 Well, those are what our grandparents 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.569
 guys have left us this 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:47.870
 of work and well we have 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:50.000
 They followed and has many years will be a 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.330
 I do not think 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.710
 again about seventy eighty years that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.710
 not if it is not more 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.250
 and from where they bring the mud 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.700
 and sand mines 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.810
 the dump carts to give it a place 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.540
 especially 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.260
 not because the whole region is in all the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.260
 region diet 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.670
