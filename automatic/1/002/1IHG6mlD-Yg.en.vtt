my<00:00:21.539> fingers<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> see<00:00:22.410> how<00:00:22.590> workable<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.220> can

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
my fingers to see how workable they can

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
my fingers to see how workable they can
be<00:00:23.670> especially<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.960> you're<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> rush<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
be especially if you're in a rush and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950 
be especially if you're in a rush and
surprisingly<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:26.970> really<00:00:27.240> easy<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.570> use

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
surprisingly it was really easy to use

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.599 
surprisingly it was really easy to use
and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.529> did<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> same<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:29.099> icing<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.580> my

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and then I did the same as icing on my

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.370 
and then I did the same as icing on my
right<00:00:29.910> eye<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.330> instead<00:00:30.660> i<00:00:30.720> set<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> look

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
right eye but instead i set the look

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.410 
right eye but instead i set the look
with<00:00:31.560> eyeshadow<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
with eyeshadow because that's what you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.120 
with eyeshadow because that's what you
normally<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.050> creamy<00:00:34.350> based<00:00:34.559> products<00:00:35.040> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
normally do it creamy based products so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
normally do it creamy based products so
that's<00:00:35.309> why<00:00:35.550> i'm<00:00:35.880> testing<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.510> okay<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that's why i'm testing it out okay so so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
that's why i'm testing it out okay so so
far<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:37.980> good<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.520> i<00:00:38.730> noticed<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.719> couple

later<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.729> just<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.940> little<00:01:54.210> bit<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.479> creasing

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
later but just a little bit of creasing

later but just a little bit of creasing
it<00:01:55.020> doesn't<00:01:55.350> look<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.560> bad<00:01:55.979> now<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> mean<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it doesn't look that bad now I mean it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.719 
it doesn't look that bad now I mean it
wasn't<00:01:57.390> extremely<00:01:57.930> hot<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.220> was<00:01:59.310> low

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
wasn't extremely hot I think it was low

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
wasn't extremely hot I think it was low

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930

the<00:02:04.170> eyeshadow<00:02:04.830> set<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.460> top<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.210> did<00:02:06.840> hold<00:02:07.170> up

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
the eyeshadow set on top it did hold up

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.980 
the eyeshadow set on top it did hold up
a<00:02:07.740> lot<00:02:08.130> better<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:09.450> noticed<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.259> some<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
a lot better I noticed that some of the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
a lot better I noticed that some of the
eyeshadow<00:02:12.990> pencil<00:02:13.290> kind<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.920> faded<00:02:14.280> away<00:02:14.430> on

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
eyeshadow pencil kind of faded away on

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.090 
eyeshadow pencil kind of faded away on
the<00:02:14.940> outer<00:02:15.120> part<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.630> my<00:02:15.780> eyes<00:02:15.959> as<00:02:16.350> well<00:02:16.950> as

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the outer part of my eyes as well as

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.070 
the outer part of my eyes as well as
both<00:02:17.459> sides<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> inner<00:02:18.360> corner<00:02:18.840> and

both sides on the inner corner and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.330 
both sides on the inner corner and
that's<00:02:19.170> probably<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.890> was<00:02:20.100> rubbing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
