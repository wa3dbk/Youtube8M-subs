00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
think i could get code long hours well

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.770 
think i could get code long hours well
not<00:05:49.710> just<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.950> it's<00:05:50.280> just<00:05:50.460> i<00:05:50.850> don't<00:05:51.419> have<00:05:51.630> the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
not just that it's just i don't have the

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.450 
not just that it's just i don't have the
demeanor<00:05:52.080> that<00:05:52.320> coaches<00:05:52.650> have<00:05:52.860> like<00:05:53.220> and

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
demeanor that coaches have like and

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.980 
demeanor that coaches have like and
maybe<00:05:53.610> I<00:05:53.729> think<00:05:54.210> it's<00:05:54.360> kind<00:05:54.540> of<00:05:54.660> just<00:05:54.810> the

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
maybe I think it's kind of just the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.469 
maybe I think it's kind of just the
nature<00:05:55.229> of<00:05:55.410> football<00:05:55.950> in<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.430> history<00:05:57.000> or<00:05:57.180> the

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
nature of football in the history or the

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.180 
nature of football in the history or the
tradition<00:05:57.960> has<00:05:58.050> been<00:05:58.200> like<00:05:58.350> coaches<00:05:58.919> like<00:05:59.070> the

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
tradition has been like coaches like the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.550 
tradition has been like coaches like the
yell<00:05:59.400> and<00:05:59.669> scream<00:05:59.790> and<00:06:00.270> like<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:00.990> can't<00:06:01.020> yell<00:06:01.410> at

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
yell and scream and like I can't yell at

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.730 
yell and scream and like I can't yell at
anybody<00:06:01.770> like<00:06:02.300> it's<00:06:03.300> that<00:06:03.479> for<00:06:03.930> what<00:06:04.110> you

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
anybody like it's that for what you

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.830 
anybody like it's that for what you
can't<00:06:04.979> motivate<00:06:05.190> people<00:06:05.580> I<00:06:05.910> motivating<00:06:06.780> and

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
can't motivate people I motivating and

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.090 
can't motivate people I motivating and
yelling<00:06:07.169> is<00:06:07.260> two<00:06:07.350> different<00:06:07.470> things<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:08.010> I

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
yelling is two different things and I

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.140 
yelling is two different things and I
think<00:06:08.130> coaches<00:06:08.669> don't<00:06:08.760> understand<00:06:10.520> well<00:06:11.520> it's

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
think coaches don't understand well it's

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.790 
think coaches don't understand well it's
