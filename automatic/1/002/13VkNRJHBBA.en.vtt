down from the top of the item to the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.270 
down from the top of the item to the
bottom<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.349> that'll<00:03:13.650> split<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.129> that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
bottom and that'll split it in that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.309 
bottom and that'll split it in that
section<00:03:14.579> then<00:03:15.239> go<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> another<00:03:15.660> position<00:03:15.989> on

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
section then go to another position on

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.289 
section then go to another position on
the<00:03:16.410> timeline<00:03:16.650> then<00:03:17.430> hit<00:03:17.579> split<00:03:17.760> again<00:03:17.910> and

the timeline then hit split again and

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.789 
the timeline then hit split again and
then<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.750> take<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:18.959> section<00:03:19.470> out<00:03:19.620> if

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
then you can take that section out if

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.280 
then you can take that section out if
you<00:03:19.889> want<00:03:20.480> using<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.599> split<00:03:21.780> functionality

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you want using the split functionality

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.569 
you want using the split functionality
like<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.739> can<00:03:22.859> actually<00:03:23.040> split<00:03:23.370> things

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
like this you can actually split things

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.099 
like this you can actually split things
into<00:03:23.849> smaller<00:03:24.120> section<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.660> make<00:03:24.810> them<00:03:24.930> into

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
into smaller section and make them into

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.300 
into smaller section and make them into
modules<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.650> can<00:03:25.769> drag<00:03:25.889> them<00:03:26.069> around<00:03:26.130> to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
modules so you can drag them around to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.009 
modules so you can drag them around to
other<00:03:26.400> parts<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.819> project<00:03:27.060> rearrange

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
other parts of the project rearrange

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.620 
other parts of the project rearrange
them<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.530> sort<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.859> thing<00:03:29.329> at<00:03:30.329> any<00:03:30.480> point

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
them that sort of thing at any point

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.819 
them that sort of thing at any point
during<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.959> process<00:03:31.169> if<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.560> realize

the timeline mode again now you can

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.319 
the timeline mode again now you can
switch<00:03:56.130> back<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.340> forth<00:03:56.489> between<00:03:56.760> instrument

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
switch back and forth between instrument

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.940 
switch back and forth between instrument
