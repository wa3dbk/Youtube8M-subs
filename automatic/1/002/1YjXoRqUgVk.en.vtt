00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.860
 tells the legend of sauron the lord 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.749

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.590

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.650
 world 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 wanted by many

 but it has ended up in the hands of the least 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390
 I could imagine 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 Sauron is enough for this ring to 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.120
 cover the lands of darkness 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.769
 destroyed 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.540
 you will find the ring 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.540
 for normal support 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.390
 I can not do this alone 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 count on my sword and count on my 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.240
 bow and with my hook this mission that has 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.610
 been entrusted if you do not find the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.610
 salvation nobody will 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.650

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.830

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.790
 I wish the ring had never come to 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.640
 me nothing more 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.150
