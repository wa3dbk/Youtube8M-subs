00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 together 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.480
 good friends we just did good 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.310
 because in this test you have seen that 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.710
 we are measuring 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.660
 if the control box gives us current 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.140
 from this boiler the invention that we have 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.540
 here done and the extractor is a test 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.940
 with which we can see if the extractor 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.640
 is wrong or the control box does not 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.720
 we are being given a signal as you finished 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.160
 watch 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.130
 Well yes that was giving us a signal 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.030
 we come back to try it again let's look 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 to give the lucecita 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.660
 and we turn off current but we go back to 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.820
 talk and he is giving us a signal 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.820
 what happens we cut good 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.159
 obviously then if you do not turn the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.269
 extractor where is the failure then clear 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.519
 in the extractor they were giving us a signal 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.610
 good as we can check if the 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.940
 extractor is fine is wrong that is 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.549
 what is happening good as 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.770
 always when we are going to take action 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.469
 well we have already taken here 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.189
 the wiring that sends us the signal 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:18.950
 of the control box to the extractor and 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.479
 then it gives us 220 volts for then if 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.710
 you want we can disconnect having 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.410
 forever 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.080
 caution that when we work then 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.480
 let's not work with danger 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.610
 well we just saw then what 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.730
 we said we did not work the boiler we 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.130
 the error can come out of which we do not 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.900
 it works the good extractor we just 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.420
 see that he sends us a signal so the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.610
 It is out of the question to be able to 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.050
 power state control there is also 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.550
 times that we may be failing the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.540
 presumed that we will see how it 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.860
 check vale 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.200
 voltage position and now how can we 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.300
 see if what has to do with the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.820
 motorcito del extractor is fine let's go 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.420
 to the very simple friends we put it in 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.420
 continuity 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.470
 let's keep going 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.640
 to disconnect 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.470
 ok we check between a tip of the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.470
 another that whistles indicates continuity 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.980
 friends because the same thing has to us 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.460
 happen with the winding the little motor if 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.460
 it's good 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.440
 there must be continuity when 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.430
 I put it like this so you can see the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.430
 screen and listen 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.210
 you see truth because it does not turn them then 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.400
 it could be that it was 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.930
 I was clutching crammed inside 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.720
 of the same steam condensates 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.270
 that comes out of the gas could be 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.150
 off or some society we can 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:11.110
 wash it inside without wetting the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.110
 little motor we check rotate or whatever 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.880
 we clean we rotate then super 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.500
 but we are seeing that the fault is not 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.010
 in the motorcycle and that the picture as such 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.360
 he was sending us current you will see 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.150
 let's do the last good test now 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.540
 we have seen check in continuity 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 and then we have also seen the voltage 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.709
 finally we are going to connect and you are going to see 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.650
 good that really this is so that 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.230
 so we can see how the cop works 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.349
 meter friend otherwise this is all 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.180
 right now as soon as we have 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.120
 we will go running again you will see that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.920
 us that turns us perfectly the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.739
 I'm going to listen to him, we give him what 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.290
 we try and that's it but it 's a way of 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.269
 eliminate we have not seen that the box 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.739
 it's good that it did not extract us 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.230
 because it could be cramped by 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.870
 inside we may even have 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.659
 spoiled well be the engine and the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.000
 evil extractor inside is there us the 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.129
 axis has been crowded not 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.100
 he turns us, he does not turn us, the coil is fine 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.510
 would have to replace vale you see me 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.220
 dismissal of you are going to see by 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.699
 last as it really is all right 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.760
 but it's a way to check and 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.560
 use the metro to see what 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.560
 is happening to us and friends look 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.610
 there you have it working correctly 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:45.020
 Nothing is proof that we wanted you 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.960
 show I hope you have found 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.409
 practice are things that are very simple 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.839
 and how have you demanded videos with 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.999
 multimeters publimetro then here is 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.169
 this little test to test if the 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.300
 extractor is well very bad 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.610
 we will continue making more videos for 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.830
 check with the metro meter worth friends 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.419
 once seen that everything is correct 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.009
 as you know always 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.259
 we test sanitary hot water 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.839
 heating and we do the relevant 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.339
 combustion analysis is worth I wish you 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.339
 have a good day friends chao
