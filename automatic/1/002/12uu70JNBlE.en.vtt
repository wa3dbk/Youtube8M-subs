to<00:00:04.770> see<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.160> technology<00:00:05.790> actually<00:00:05.970> start<00:00:06.599> in

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
to see the technology actually start in

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.789 
to see the technology actually start in
the<00:00:06.720> lab<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.109> make<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> point<00:00:07.680> where

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the lab and make it to a point where

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.410 
the lab and make it to a point where
actually<00:00:07.979> affecting<00:00:08.639> somebody<00:00:08.969> it's<00:00:09.180> pretty

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
actually affecting somebody it's pretty

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060 
actually affecting somebody it's pretty
powerful<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.959> never<00:00:10.260> knew<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.440> Bionic

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
powerful I never knew that Bionic

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.129 
powerful I never knew that Bionic
technology<00:00:11.549> existed<00:00:12.180> to<00:00:12.629> a<00:00:12.660> point<00:00:12.929> where<00:00:13.080> it

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
technology existed to a point where it

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.379 
technology existed to a point where it
was<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.379> to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.500> used<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.309> soon<00:00:14.669> in<00:00:15.240> my

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
was going to be used this soon in my

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.340 
was going to be used this soon in my
life

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
life

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.870 
life
can<00:00:17.920> you<00:00:18.010> tell<00:00:18.190> me<00:00:18.279> a<00:00:18.310> little<00:00:18.369> bit<00:00:18.610> about<00:00:18.730> the

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
can you tell me a little bit about the

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.250 
can you tell me a little bit about the
technology<00:00:19.210> that<00:00:19.480> I'm<00:00:19.660> looking<00:00:19.930> at<00:00:20.050> right<00:00:20.199> now

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
technology that I'm looking at right now

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.529 
technology that I'm looking at right now
I<00:00:20.529> mean<00:00:20.680> this<00:00:20.800> thing<00:00:21.010> is<00:00:21.039> walking<00:00:21.580> so<00:00:22.000> this<00:00:22.390> is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
I mean this thing is walking so this is

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.240 
I mean this thing is walking so this is
EXO<00:00:22.900> we<00:00:23.140> like<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.349> think<00:00:23.470> of<00:00:23.590> it<00:00:23.680> as<00:00:23.770> a<00:00:23.800> wearable

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
EXO we like to think of it as a wearable

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.310 
EXO we like to think of it as a wearable
robot<00:00:24.610> okay<00:00:24.849> and<00:00:25.419> it's<00:00:25.660> been<00:00:25.810> designed<00:00:25.930> to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
robot okay and it's been designed to

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.690 
robot okay and it's been designed to
help<00:00:26.470> people<00:00:26.650> with<00:00:26.890> spinal<00:00:27.070> cord<00:00:27.279> injuries

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
help people with spinal cord injuries

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.249 
help people with spinal cord injuries
actually<00:00:28.060> stand<00:00:28.300> up<00:00:28.450> and<00:00:28.570> walk<00:00:31.020> so<00:00:32.020> is<00:00:32.079> there

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
actually stand up and walk so is there

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.660 
actually stand up and walk so is there
any<00:00:32.349> way<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:32.470> I<00:00:32.680> could<00:00:32.890> actually<00:00:33.070> test<00:00:33.460> out

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
any way that I could actually test out

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.140 
any way that I could actually test out
the<00:00:33.820> technology<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.920> we<00:00:39.220> always<00:00:39.580> start<00:00:40.000> with<00:00:40.030> a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
the technology so we always start with a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.970 
the technology so we always start with a
walker<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.750> gives<00:00:40.930> us<00:00:41.080> the<00:00:41.199> most<00:00:41.350> stability

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
walker it gives us the most stability

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.220 
walker it gives us the most stability
okay<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.879> so<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.600> first<00:00:43.750> thing<00:00:43.989> we're<00:00:44.170> gonna

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
okay and so the first thing we're gonna

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.350 
okay and so the first thing we're gonna
have<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> totally<00:00:45.550> stand<00:00:45.850> out<00:00:46.030> the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
have to do is totally stand out the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.790 
have to do is totally stand out the
robot<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:46.809> gonna<00:00:46.960> do<00:00:47.170> all<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.620> work<00:00:47.769> for

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
robot is gonna do all of the work for

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.580 
robot is gonna do all of the work for
you<00:00:48.190> for<00:00:48.220> your<00:00:48.610> legs<00:00:48.910> okay<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:49.840> your<00:00:50.110> knees<00:00:50.379> and

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
you for your legs okay so your knees and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.380 
you for your legs okay so your knees and
your<00:00:50.739> hips<00:00:51.010> are<00:00:51.190> gonna<00:00:51.340> be<00:00:51.520> taken<00:00:51.850> care<00:00:51.879> of

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
your hips are gonna be taken care of

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.779 
your hips are gonna be taken care of
1<00:00:52.570> 2<00:00:53.260> 3<00:00:53.730> whoa<00:00:55.980> wow<00:00:56.980> that's<00:00:57.370> such<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.579> weird

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
1 2 3 whoa wow that's such a weird

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.819 
1 2 3 whoa wow that's such a weird
sensation<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:59.170> feels<00:00:59.440> like<00:00:59.590> it<00:00:59.710> weighs

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
sensation it feels like it weighs

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.010 
sensation it feels like it weighs
nothing<00:01:00.160> exactly<00:01:00.879> all<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.239> way<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.690> exo

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
nothing exactly all the way to the exo

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.689 
nothing exactly all the way to the exo
goes<00:01:02.199> down<00:01:02.410> around<00:01:02.739> on<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.280> side<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.520> your

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
goes down around on the side of your

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.920 
goes down around on the side of your
body<00:01:03.850> Ollie<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.300> ground<00:01:04.509> so<00:01:04.660> you<00:01:04.750> don't

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
body Ollie to the ground so you don't

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.120 
body Ollie to the ground so you don't
feel<00:01:05.080> anything<00:01:05.259> if<00:01:05.470> I'm<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.710> spinal<00:01:06.039> cord

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
feel anything if I'm a spinal cord

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.889 
feel anything if I'm a spinal cord
injury<00:01:06.250> patient<00:01:06.759> today<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.690> have

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
injury patient today and I have

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.719 
injury patient today and I have
completely<00:01:08.320> no<00:01:08.560> control<00:01:08.979> of<00:01:09.009> my<00:01:09.220> lower<00:01:09.399> legs

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
completely no control of my lower legs

completely no control of my lower legs
the<00:01:10.420> exoskeleton<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.259> great<00:01:11.530> tool<00:01:11.800> for

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
the exoskeleton is a great tool for

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.700 
the exoskeleton is a great tool for
helping<00:01:12.490> them<00:01:12.850> walk<00:01:13.119> through<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:14.110> specified

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
helping them walk through a specified

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.130 
helping them walk through a specified
gait<00:01:14.979> pattern<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:16.210> walking<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.780> as<00:01:16.960> you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
gait pattern you're walking and as you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.400 
gait pattern you're walking and as you
progress<00:01:17.320> through<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.119> walker<00:01:20.020> then<00:01:20.320> we

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
progress through with the walker then we

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.320 
progress through with the walker then we
can<00:01:20.530> graduate<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.009> crutches<00:01:21.580> it's<00:01:21.850> it's<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.180> lot

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
can graduate to crutches it's it's a lot

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.510 
can graduate to crutches it's it's a lot
bigger<00:01:22.600> though<00:01:22.960> than<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.259> expected<00:01:23.890> -<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.369> like

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
bigger though than I expected - we like

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.240 
bigger though than I expected - we like
to<00:01:24.640> think<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.939> this<00:01:25.060> as<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:26.740> suit<00:01:27.009> case

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
to think of this as the first suit case

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.580 
to think of this as the first suit case
cell<00:01:27.490> phone<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.909> Bionic<00:01:28.270> industry<00:01:28.689> so<00:01:28.960> our

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
cell phone of the Bionic industry so our

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.950 
cell phone of the Bionic industry so our
goal<00:01:29.770> obviously<00:01:29.950> is<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.580> make<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.420> smaller<00:01:31.720> as

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
goal obviously is to make it smaller as

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960 
goal obviously is to make it smaller as
we<00:01:32.110> as<00:01:32.290> we<00:01:32.320> progress<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:33.159> as<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.700> get<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.880> that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
we as we progress and as we get to that

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.460 
we as we progress and as we get to that
personal<00:01:34.390> advice<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.750> doesn't<00:01:35.020> need<00:01:35.200> all

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
personal advice that doesn't need all

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.749 
personal advice that doesn't need all
the<00:01:35.619> adjustability<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.280> other<00:01:36.400> features

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
the adjustability and other features

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.819 
the adjustability and other features
that<00:01:36.850> this<00:01:37.000> has<00:01:37.210> for<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.140> rehab<00:01:38.350> environment

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
that this has for the rehab environment

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:39.780 
that this has for the rehab environment
we<00:01:38.890> got<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.100> keep<00:01:39.220> pushing<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.640> technology

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
we got to keep pushing the technology
