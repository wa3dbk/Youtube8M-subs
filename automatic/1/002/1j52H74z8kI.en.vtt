00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 hi all guys here is mystery 95 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 as you can see this is a video 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 separate from the video card boxing 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.390
 we have divided them to be able to divide 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.390
 in turn also the videos of the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.919
 playlist that deals with hardware 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.219
 so this video will be anyway 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.050
 we say divided into two parts, that is, to the 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.759
 review and assembly of the board 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 video 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.480
 let's start reviews immediately and with 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.960
 card sizes that are 27 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.390
 about centimeters in length 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.449
 eleven and a half in width and about 4.2 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.010
 now these cards are in height 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.839
 all require church size 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.039
 quite large such as le 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.920
 full tower 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.690
 in fact I am now also passing the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.909
 bigger to make you breathe 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.829
 better also the video card and all the 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.749
 components 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.999
 the card is based on the new process a 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.880
 28 nanometers of amd 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.070
 it also characterized by 1792 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.760
 stream processors a little less 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.460
 compared to 79 70 the gpu clock is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.909
 of 950 megahertz the standard clock is of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.070
 800 the actual blocking of the memory e 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.649
 of 1,250 meyers 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.530
 obviously this is not for that blocked 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.360
 they correspond to 5 gigabits per second 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.549
 also this card has 3 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.369
 gigabyte of memory gddr5 with 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.939
 a 384-bit memory interface e 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.219
 a pci express 3.0 as indeed the 79 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.450
 70 with this card you will have to 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.280
 available all that is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.829
 immediate offer for an experience of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 perfect usage as you ended up for 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.430
 support up to three screens 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.600
 simultaneously and compatibility 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.189
 with the 3d 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.869
 now let's take a look at the back of the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.020
 card where they are noted starting from 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.090
 left two mini displayport 1.2 of which 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.380
 the maximum resolution is 4096 x 2160 then 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 going to the right 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.479
 we have a hdmi 1.4 port a from 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 maximum resolution of 4096 x 3.112 per 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.800
 finish we have a dual link dvi port 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.310
 ai from the highest resolution supported 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.530
 of 2560 x 1600 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.420
 so we can finally say that the only ones 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.180
 differences that divide this card from 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.860
 a 79 70 reference is the number of 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 stream processors and the flop of 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.260
 memory if in fact you buy this 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.930
 card in diction or overclock from 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.360
 950 maggert processor clock like 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.170
 in fact mine is the difference in power 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.489
 with a 79 70 is really minimal we pass 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.640
 now to the assembly of the card 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:51.870
 inside the case ok 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.440
 let's proceed with the assembly we don't give the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440
 side panel 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.299
 it depends on what you write that I can't 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.299
 avoid these two screws 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:14.720
 yes it's not a fantastic case I have to 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:24.950
 change soon then then 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:30.299
 renew francesca gives the perfect idea 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.870
 now this morning would be good instead 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:40.700
 lives 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:40.700
 I'm going to get it what's needed 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.290
 an experimentation feeding aimed at 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.570
 this is my old hd 57 70 radio 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.780
 steamed 1 gb hicks 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.510
 seems a fair transformer considering that 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:36.330
 which is a 6 this we believe 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:38.370
 16 and one of 8 15 ok now zoom in to 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.470
 to show with seed of so it cannot be 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.360
 anto's inside this little room 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.370
 kaiser then give it to him monthly 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.949
 hand that more realistic this friend that 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:56.840
 it was his hand on the card but on 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:05:01.169
 same floor as the hard disk 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.160
 become the water inside the board of 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.160
 8 connectors 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.180
 fir 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.129
 ok finally I managed to pocket 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.810
 all connections due by the hour 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.849
 attack the two 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.280
 the adapter that there was the car movie in the 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.979
 construction because otherwise I could not 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.629
 getting off your commission is fine 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:38.050
 of the limitation of the risks that 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:40.479
 had to move under it did not get there 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.599
 body connection then contacted already 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.900
 everyone here is or by chance behind with the 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.900
 life 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:59.379
 the school is fantastic then too 

00:06:55.429 --> 00:07:02.379
 nothing related reported of 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.379
 sterilization 

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:09.849
 this was the connection of truth 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.849
 quite complicated
