will<00:00:10.650> understand<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.610> recovering<00:00:12.030> with

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
will understand that recovering with

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.810 
will understand that recovering with
them<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:13.230> problem<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.400> something

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
them is a problem and it's something

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.500 
them is a problem and it's something
that<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.240> pretty<00:00:16.199> much<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.850> master<00:00:17.850> to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
that you pretty much have to master to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.290 
that you pretty much have to master to
actually<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:20.160> good<00:00:20.430> Luigi<00:00:21.000> player

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
actually be a really good Luigi player

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.640 
actually be a really good Luigi player
because<00:00:22.519> his<00:00:23.519> his<00:00:24.150> jumps<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.320> great

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
because his his jumps are really great

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.419 
because his his jumps are really great
but<00:00:26.340> his<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.699> B<00:00:27.109> unfortunately<00:00:28.109> goes

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
but his up B unfortunately goes

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.250 
but his up B unfortunately goes
vertically<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> his<00:00:30.330> over<00:00:30.689> B<00:00:30.840> goes<00:00:31.080> like

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
vertically and his over B goes like

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
vertically and his over B goes like
straight<00:00:31.830> horizontally<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.930> case

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
straight horizontally so in that case

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.750 
straight horizontally so in that case
you<00:00:34.290> can't<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:34.770> go<00:00:35.010> diagonally<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you can't really go diagonally and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
you can't really go diagonally and
recover<00:00:36.120> X<00:00:36.420> besides<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.290> move<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
recover X besides this move which I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.060 
recover X besides this move which I
covered<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> previous<00:00:39.000> episode<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> today<00:00:41.040> I

jump button hit up B so here's to hear

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
jump button hit up B so here's to hear
that<00:01:49.829> again<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.159> normal<00:01:50.460> speed<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.850> ready<00:01:51.450> to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.290 
that maximum height just look how fast
you're<00:02:07.740> getting<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.970> mean<00:02:09.149> it's

you're getting up there and I mean it's
it's<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> same<00:02:09.929> thing<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.280> you're

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
it's the same thing for like so you're

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.010 
it's the same thing for like so you're
just<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.910> far<00:02:12.120> away

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
just a little far away

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.580
