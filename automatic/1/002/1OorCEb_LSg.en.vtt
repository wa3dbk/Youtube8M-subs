00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.940
 hello girls how are you today 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.680
 I 'm going to show you my basic routine that 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.099
 I'm doing right now I've been asked 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.429
 a lot and they wanted to do it today because 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.860
 In my last video they asked me and they 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.320
 I'm going to teach how to do my contour 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.660
 in a separate video because now I do 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.840
 outline with cream the last video that 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.150
 I did outline was with dust inside 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.279
 then very soon I will have a video 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.370
 of outline but today I 'm going to teach 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.320
 how do I do my base and my basic routine 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.190
 for oily skin and here I have skin 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.670
 fatty with acne and hopefully you like it 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.670
 this video 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.250
 ok boys, the first thing I do is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.219
 put on my skin because I have 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.870
 acne I always put on after so 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.870
 I got rid of pimples 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.560
 the next thing I'm going to do is with my 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.500
 step cream now I'm going to apply it in 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.660
 all my face especially in places in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.820
 my face where I have dry skin 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.250
 me is between the nose and around the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.250
 nose and I'm going to put it all over my face 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.920
 while my dry faces moisturizer 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.140
 to apply my base for the eyes this is 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.930
 something I do in every routine I feel that 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.090
 if wrong apply before putting my shadows 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.720
 the shadows are left in place and I 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 last all day 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.300
 with my first prebase work I'm going to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.850
 apply all over my face focusing on 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.980
 especially where I have everyone a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 little bit big that is around here in 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.010
 the cheeks and there I will apply it in 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.910
 circular function to this base I like 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 because it leaves my face all matt and I do not 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.020
 help with oil 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.629
 Now with this live of your face I'm going to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.700
 apply on all my stable face a 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.920
 little bit of this product in my last 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.160
 hall as I like to leave my face 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.709
 This cream can be used alone or it can be 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.750
 use before a base that is like me 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.560
 I like to use it because I think it helps me 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.670
 to one that does not occupy so much base and second 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.250
 it leaves my face 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.420
 clear leaves it a little thinner then 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.420
 I love this product 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.990
 for me this product makes a great 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.140
 difference and now I'm going to use two bases 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.569
 one of cabandié and one of seeing - like 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.510
 choose from virip lander you have to 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.760
 make sure to mix well to see - and 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.459
 now I'm going to grab a little bit only 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.420
 that it softens and like three drops 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.220
 determine if I'm going to mix them together 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.530
 since I mix it I will put points for 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.930
 my whole face I like this technique to me 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.360
 and I like to put 9 points because that's the way 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.120
 I can see exactly where I need to 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.840
 cover more and it makes me easier to 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.840
 apply it like this 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.040
 since I have my wet sponge I'm going to 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.980
 start bouncing the sponge all over 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.290
 my face where my base ends to this 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.810
 technical help so that the base does not look 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.450
 strong and look a little natural already 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.670
 that the basis of avandia is a little 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.000
 thick and I do not want to be noticed much 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.580
 that 'is not enough and this technique helps 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.590
 leaves the face a little bit lit up using 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.870
 a wet sponge 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.420
 but I love this technique because if 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 the whole base looks natural and now only 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.130
 applied my base with sponge 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
 using more of the product that I left over 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.239
 to apply a little more to where I need 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.760
 cover more than for me are the cheeks 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.040
 from around my mouth in my nose and 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.650
 with the same sponge bounce the iv to 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.630
 blur and as I told you girls I 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.789
 love this technique I think if they want 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.940
 a natural look at its base is very 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.759
 important to use a sponge of these 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.100
 Bell techniques only cost like 5 to 7 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.930
 dollars or they may like a weak and 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.930
 plant that does exactly the same 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.690
 now with correctly nose and 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.720
 powder summer powder let's do that 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.430
 my dark circles disappear I like this 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.250
 correctly because although it is a 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.229
 slightly thick it looks very natural and with 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.900
 the sponge I will do the same the same 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.750
 sponge let's start to blur is 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.509
 super easy to blur a correctly or 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.600
 the base with a sponge and it looks super 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.600
 natural 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.249
 and now so that the light correctly 

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:37.080
 last all day with banana powder 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:40.199
 father I'm going to apply where I put my 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.449
 correctly and so it will not be removed 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.720
 I'm not going to do lines of anything 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.510
 daylong 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.960
 now with a town of you are bread and a 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.850
 base in powder take I'm going to apply what 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.340
 I'm going to mix the two and with a brush 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.160
 of astérix or begins to apply in my 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.500
 face first what I do is make sure 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.650
 that squeezes the brush against my face that 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.440
 will help the base stay in 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.630
 place and that I see myself mate and then what 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.270
 I make circular motions and that helps 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.430
 that the skin looks a little thinner and 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.620
 I do this in my face if 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.190
 I also take my time with this already 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.800
 who applied the dust not all gods just 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.140
 little by little so you can see everything 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.140
 well natural and I also take my time 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.030
 and this is the final step in the end you 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.759
 see how my base looks like my videos 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.539
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.110
 until next time 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.110
 goodbye
