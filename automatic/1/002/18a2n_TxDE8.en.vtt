knives<00:00:05.140> this<00:00:06.069> time<00:00:06.339> I'm<00:00:06.520> making<00:00:06.669> Oh<00:00:08.580> basically

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
knives this time I'm making Oh basically

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.610 
knives this time I'm making Oh basically
I<00:00:09.610> guess<00:00:09.880> it's<00:00:10.060> a<00:00:10.150> would<00:00:10.330> lower<00:00:10.540> clone<00:00:10.990> a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
I guess it's a would lower clone a

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.859 
I guess it's a would lower clone a
couple<00:00:11.860> of<00:00:12.340> them<00:00:12.520> of<00:00:13.270> this<00:00:13.540> one<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.630> thing

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
couple of them of this one and thing

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.170 
couple of them of this one and thing
that<00:00:16.900> I'm<00:00:17.109> focused<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:17.950> one<00:00:18.190> has<00:00:19.000> nothing

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
that I'm focused this one has nothing

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.450 
that I'm focused this one has nothing
heat<00:00:19.510> treated<00:00:19.840> yet<00:00:20.020> but<00:00:20.200> it's<00:00:20.320> got<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.530> single

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
heat treated yet but it's got a single

bevel flat grind on it scandinavian
grind<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.610> i<00:00:25.119> did<00:00:25.360> that<00:00:25.470> using<00:00:26.470> this<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.720> little

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
grind and i did that using this a little

belt belt grinder sander I'm gonna try

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.680 
belt belt grinder sander I'm gonna try
something<00:00:32.050> different<00:00:32.760> with<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:33.969> one<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
something different with this one I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.759 
something different with this one I
worked<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:37.809> little<00:00:37.929> bit<00:00:38.109> on<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.319> bevel<00:00:38.469> but

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
worked a little bit on the bevel but

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.279 
worked a little bit on the bevel but
then<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:38.980> reach<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.370> plate<00:00:39.729> I'm<00:00:40.149> going<00:00:40.449> to<00:00:40.510> try<00:00:40.809> on

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
then I reach a plate I'm going to try on

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.309 
then I reach a plate I'm going to try on
this<00:00:41.769> one<00:00:42.359> to<00:00:43.359> use<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.829> grinder<00:00:45.569> to<00:00:46.569> to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:47.319 
this one to use this grinder to to

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:50.700 
this one to use this grinder to to
establish<00:00:47.859> the<00:00:47.979> bevel<00:00:48.280> on<00:00:48.370> here<00:00:48.729> and<00:00:49.319> it<00:00:50.319> is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
establish the bevel on here and it is

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.619 
establish the bevel on here and it is
going<00:00:50.889> to<00:00:50.979> put<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.159> little<00:00:51.460> bit<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.819> concavity

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
going to put a little bit of a concavity

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.639 
going to put a little bit of a concavity
on<00:00:52.780> this<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:54.309> when<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.149> sharpen<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.929> I<00:00:56.079> hope<00:00:56.350> to

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
on this but when I sharpen it I hope to

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.899 
on this but when I sharpen it I hope to
not<00:00:57.519> leave<00:00:57.789> it<00:00:57.940> as<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.979> concave<00:00:59.979> grind<00:01:00.399> because

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
not leave it as a concave grind because

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.710 
not leave it as a concave grind because
I<00:01:00.940> don't<00:01:01.389> like<00:01:01.539> a<00:01:02.190> real<00:01:03.190> deep<00:01:03.909> concave<00:01:04.449> grind

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
I don't like a real deep concave grind

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.270 
I don't like a real deep concave grind
because<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.080> makes<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> edge<00:01:05.500> weak<00:01:05.829> but<00:01:06.159> I'm

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
because it makes the edge weak but I'm

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.310 
because it makes the edge weak but I'm
going<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.430> try<00:01:06.729> on<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.689> grinder<00:01:08.140> to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
going to try on this grinder to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.740 
going to try on this grinder to
establish<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.189> bevel<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.670> just<00:01:10.479> see<00:01:10.630> how

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
establish the bevel and just see how

00:01:10.750 --> 00:02:10.339 
establish the bevel and just see how
that<00:01:10.810> works

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.780 

all<00:02:11.349> right<00:02:14.640> well<00:02:15.640> I'm<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:15.909> covering<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.450> far

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
all right well I'm just covering so far

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.150 
all right well I'm just covering so far
I'm<00:02:18.790> afraid<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> doesn't

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.090 

okay<00:02:25.820> what<00:02:26.120> I'm<00:02:26.240> discovering<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:26.990> far<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.560> that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
okay what I'm discovering so far is that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.270 
okay what I'm discovering so far is that
it<00:02:28.250> takes<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.610> real<00:02:28.850> steady<00:02:29.300> hand<00:02:30.280> which

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
it takes a real steady hand which

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.160 
it takes a real steady hand which
apparently<00:02:31.700> I'm<00:02:31.820> not<00:02:31.970> doing<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.210> good<00:02:32.330> job<00:02:32.390> of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.970 

to<00:02:36.170> keep<00:02:36.440> from<00:02:37.000> getting<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.240> lot<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.480> different

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
to keep from getting a lot of different

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.120 
to keep from getting a lot of different
angles<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.280> each<00:02:40.430> pass<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.800> real

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
angles with each pass so this is a real

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.280 
angles with each pass so this is a real
sloppy<00:02:43.580> looking<00:02:44.030> grind<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.660> far<00:02:44.960> I'm<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:45.200> to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
sloppy looking grind so far I'm going to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.370 
sloppy looking grind so far I'm going to
have<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.590> work<00:02:45.800> on<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.810> keeps<00:02:48.020> being

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
have to work on it but if it keeps being

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.080 
have to work on it but if it keeps being
this<00:02:48.620> tough<00:02:48.920> I'm<00:02:49.190> going<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.400> go<00:02:49.520> back<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.910> using

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
this tough I'm going to go back to using

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:48.030 
this tough I'm going to go back to using
the<00:02:50.330> little<00:02:51.370> little<00:02:52.370> belt<00:02:52.550> sander<00:02:52.940> over<00:02:53.150> there

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.680 

all<00:03:49.040> right<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.460> I've<00:03:49.580> discovered<00:03:49.970> about<00:03:50.450> me

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
all right what I've discovered about me

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.050 
all right what I've discovered about me
and<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:52.670> kind<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.060> grinder<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:54.230> I

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
and that kind of a grinder is that I

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.190 
and that kind of a grinder is that I
don't<00:03:56.060> think<00:03:56.270> I've<00:03:56.390> got<00:03:56.570> a<00:03:56.600> steady<00:03:56.930> enough

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
don't think I've got a steady enough

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.060 
don't think I've got a steady enough
hand<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> grinding<00:04:00.320> wheel<00:04:00.380> with<00:04:00.860> that

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
hand for a grinding wheel with that

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.550 
hand for a grinding wheel with that
small<00:04:01.550> of<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.880> radius<00:04:02.300> if<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.930> if<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.380> wheel

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
small of a radius if the if that wheel

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.910 
small of a radius if the if that wheel
was<00:04:03.770> a<00:04:03.830> lot<00:04:04.070> bigger<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.550> diameter<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:06.170> think<00:04:06.800> it

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
was a lot bigger in diameter I think it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.380 
was a lot bigger in diameter I think it
would<00:04:07.040> be<00:04:07.130> easier<00:04:07.520> for<00:04:07.820> me<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:07.940> maintain<00:04:08.360> a

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
would be easier for me to maintain a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.130 
would be easier for me to maintain a
consistent<00:04:08.840> angle<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:11.300> this<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.570> just

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
consistent angle on it but this is just

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.630 
consistent angle on it but this is just
not<00:04:12.350> working<00:04:12.530> out<00:04:12.860> I'm<00:04:13.010> going<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.190> have<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.520> go

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
not working out I'm going to have to go

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.690 
not working out I'm going to have to go
back<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.230> use<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.590> sanding<00:04:16.630> belt<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.459> was

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
back and use the sanding belt but it was

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.670 
back and use the sanding belt but it was
a<00:04:19.760> nice<00:04:19.940> little<00:04:19.970> experiment<00:04:23.500> okay<00:04:24.500> after

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
a nice little experiment okay after

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.470 
a nice little experiment okay after
messing<00:04:25.160> things<00:04:25.340> up<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.910> grinding<00:04:26.330> wheel

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
messing things up on the grinding wheel

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.909 
messing things up on the grinding wheel
I<00:04:26.510> took<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.020> over<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.120> belt<00:04:29.120> sander

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
I took it over to the belt sander

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.920 
I took it over to the belt sander
there's<00:04:30.919> still<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.610> couple<00:04:32.090> little<00:04:32.270> defects

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
there's still a couple little defects

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.880 
there's still a couple little defects
that<00:04:34.780> it's<00:04:35.780> going<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:35.990> take<00:04:36.230> multiple

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
that it's going to take multiple

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.540 
that it's going to take multiple
sharpening<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.880> get<00:04:38.030> these<00:04:38.240> out<00:04:38.620> but<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.680> went<00:04:40.430> a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
sharpening to get these out but I went a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.240 
sharpening to get these out but I went a
bit<00:04:40.580> back<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.180> using<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:42.020> flat<00:04:42.350> platen<00:04:42.980> I

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
bit back to using the the flat platen I

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.360 
bit back to using the the flat platen I
don't<00:04:44.240> know<00:04:44.300> maybe<00:04:44.540> if<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.810> get<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.370> grinding

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
don't know maybe if I get a grinding

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.920 
don't know maybe if I get a grinding
wheel<00:04:46.430> with<00:04:46.669> a<00:04:46.700> larger<00:04:47.060> diameter<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.570> might<00:04:47.720> try

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
wheel with a larger diameter I might try

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.720 
wheel with a larger diameter I might try
that<00:04:48.110> later<00:04:48.290> but<00:04:48.650> for<00:04:48.800> now<00:04:48.950> I<00:04:49.160> think<00:04:49.520> I'm<00:04:49.610> going

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
that later but for now I think I'm going

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.540 
that later but for now I think I'm going
to<00:04:49.820> stick<00:04:50.030> with<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.390> sanding<00:04:51.350> belt<00:04:51.550> thanks

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
to stick with the sanding belt thanks

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.000 
to stick with the sanding belt thanks
for<00:04:52.669> watching
