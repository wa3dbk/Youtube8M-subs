00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.850
 What's wrong with the first mountain climbing common sense ? 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:13.610
 4 Downhill is more comfortable 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:18.619
 On the verse of the news , the body is comfortable , and the joints are uncomfortable. 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.869
 For it strikes down a lot of markers that can haneunge When did climb empathy 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.619
 No, I'm going anywhere . 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.369
 I never thought I'd be easier when you get down to the bar, I sped I said, 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.900
 Walk 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.439
 Once coming close kkwot 500m walk to get down to warm bwajun paenpi eopeu 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.540
 Ah tel 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 For too when climbing is not the time does descend or climb value only 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.180
 Of course you only come down . 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:53.640
 Thoughts come to Hassan City where much of the mountain accident came down. 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.570
 When the time is up, the course will go up steeply . 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 Please manne that most preferably come down're right 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:08.039
 Now is the time to answer the second Shall Front Mountain 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.100
 But here you have to tell the author that positive shaving particles are good or wrong 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:15.750
 Do you think you know that.That 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 If you drank a bottle like the Buffon medicine, it gets hotter and you feel better. 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.940
 You know me well 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 Ultimately, that is the theory and 4 expansion 2 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.530
 Now it's a lot of stuff to lose because it's cold or windy 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.569
 If you drink the same thing the day you blow 2 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.790
 I'm coming in a little fall risk transfer principles rubbish experts talk funny cup 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:44.880
 I hope you enjoy it even if I'm not a good example in the mountain hermitage 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 For a lot of these worries fourth eoyigo or does gonna burn nice legs 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 I can enjoy 2, and when I went to the mountain, I see the calf muscles open. 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.040
 It is the most representative aerobic form on the top of the leaf 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.460
 It's the exercise of the document . 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:08.280
 For this, giving fat because it reduces the decomposition of the local station that cell 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:13.530
 For that a common 6 cells due to the continuous movement more solid so 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 The muscles become harder and the fat becomes a woman. 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.079
 That many people with different proportional ppaerago get to see me live out a little nine-year-old 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.370
 I'm going to arrest a lot of climbers while you talk. 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:30.209
 Hyundai now has not made a start for losing weight, but riding a bicycle 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.190
 Also look to see'm allowed to know background'll walk fast like that haeboryeo 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.970
 How does this climbing work out as a movement to lose weight? 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.620
 Climbing is actually physically so high that you are going up . 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.940
 Yes then you are going to be doing the problem and going to the side of the flat is not going to work 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.209
 I gotta geolro itjyo 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.680
 Because it actually does this actually , 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.989
 I can see that it works. 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:03.769
 But it depends nephew walking fast in the running then swim and then what 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.769
 This will be a player like this .
