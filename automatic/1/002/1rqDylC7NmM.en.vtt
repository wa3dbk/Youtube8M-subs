00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 career mode 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.700
 it will be very very short today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.320
 because unfortunately I have screwed it to follow 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 to change properly 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.710
 i had the consequence of the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.670
 saturday two times less than great 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 That's why unfortunately there is only one today 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.100
 very short episode against hellas 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.369
 Verona and against the FC Parma is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.779
 Today I show you only the gates and 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.939
 if anything else happened 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 because otherwise the time is too short I am 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.829
 as a card really at 14 clock on first 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.280
 what valentino lazarov against hellas 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.329
 Verona 61 minute makes the goal to 1 0 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.670
 shortly after we hit the fc arsenal 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.170
 have come further in the europe 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.910
 league under content against juventus in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.680
 to play the next episode 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 it was definitely nicely done here 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.289
 from lazard with the lupfer over mihajlov 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 and thus the 10th 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.199
 Of course you should play both games 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.010
 win against FC Parma 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.379
 maybe experiment a bit 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.049
 I'll come to that again soon 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.900
 then it was hellas verona over 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.299
 samuel longo and daniel agger to the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.060
 shortly waits for half injury and the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.040
 pulls off to one to one makes him 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 really strong played the norway 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 had here then with the 1 1 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.150
 rewarded 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.979
 at the score it is also 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 stayed because nothing had happened 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.939
 generally boring game 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.810
 it definitely makes a good job here 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.979
 past real and thereby to 1 1 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 point division against hellas verona 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.990
 This has been making me a little bit tighter since then 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.630
 here briefly the statistics and the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 maybe a crucial scene the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.829
 still half injury had nothing 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.450
 out of what has become four 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.790
 scorers result on the other 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.170
 also costly to survey 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.079
 nothing at all happened except for 1 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.479
 11 otherwise only a draw against parma 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.100
 I wanted it because of juventus 1 343 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.229
 Maybe try juventus 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 game system and can counter 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.640
 I had thought because parma, too 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.770
 a 3-5-2 ball possession tactic 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.959
 System plays that maybe 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.000
 just test very well against parma 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.680
 you could not do the formation 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.800
 went completely wrong 0 to 0 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.550
 against parma from so cruel games single 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.620
 Worst we have ever had and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.860
 by this point division also here one 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.120
 red card for lazaro was where i was 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.860
 not quite that was the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.080
 The same will see the foul again 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.270
 from that at least the red card 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.580
 not even and that was it for then 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.950
 Today the work is now five minutes 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.800
 Video does not matter if I will in three minutes 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 or four minutes of video that was now 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.650
 hof really are that I ever since 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.320
 did not check that the follow 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.920
 from saturday had changed again and 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.110
 here are the two games against hellas 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 verona and failed against parma 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.680
 slowly top part locked for a game 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.900
 there is also locked he had too many 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.340
 get yellow cards and in the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.070
 next episode content is against 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.650
 Catania and Juventus sorry as I said 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.400
 again that it just so wrong 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.440
 has gone because should take active place 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.519
 the result was already finished 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.810
 and so on I have no idea where the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.720
 I think I have already deleted 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.400
 that was shitty sorry but there is 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.400
 it's a completely long day on thursday 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.709
 follow Saturday also Tuesday so well 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.510
 Again big sorry though it was 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.150
 then just too short to normal together 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.530
 to render and cut together 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.320
 I would not have done that until 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.820
 18 clock this is how I manage so completely 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.290
 just 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.519
 but well, I guess you can 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.130
 get over a bit, too 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.079
 I still have sorry and see you 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.079
