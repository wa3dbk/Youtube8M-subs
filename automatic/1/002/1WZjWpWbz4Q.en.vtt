00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.400
 so guys hello 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.540
 collected quickly only to show 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 principle here it is the device itself is connected 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.330
 only the land will go out now and on 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 the street it still in the plates will start spring still 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 Well, did not collect quickly gathered quickly from 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.939
 what was at hand a simple view 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 400 watt modulation inverter 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.340
 used it on this bouncer keys 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 dismantled the inclusion to design 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 especially I will not say anything part 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 this is how you need to show that he 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.930
 fully connected here the earth goes on 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.340
 light bulbs and do not need electronics 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 at night and goes for the weekend 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.480
 here it is the coil wire comes out goes on 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 light bulb up to endured inside there is still 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.040
 here he is friends working for secrecy for 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.500
 face 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.820
 Well, who is familiar with the generator Hendershot 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.830
 then he knows why 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.910
 output quit in this something magnetic 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.620
 I will tell you a little field like that 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:26.850
 working inductor resonant here it is 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.590
 winding two layers removable she's true 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.979
 gives me an hour much more 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.350
 It turned out what she needed right now 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.110
 This is the winding here and the meters of the wire come out 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.400
 straightening filters on a black nose 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.110
 then non-polar capacitance and probably over 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.820
 taro immediately goes right here 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.619
 to see for yourself all the wires 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
 make on just on the diode bridge 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:58.619
 diode bridge mask goes power on 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.110
 nickname one key that is it turns out 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.200
 the diode bridge is modulated when it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.240
 straightens on trial here it was possible 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.920
 don't do this on the keys very much 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.790
 warm for a long time to export the impossibility 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.000
 that is, a miracle will now have to be 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.530
 connect the battery launcher on 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.010
 Inverter puzzle Turn off 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.459
 voltage and electronically gone and he 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.459
 key to 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.040
 so now I will connect this output here 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.360
 battery and go out on purpose 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.990
 to include this all show like this 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.990
 will do now
