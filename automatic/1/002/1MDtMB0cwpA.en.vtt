about how to make crepes I've made a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.729 
about how to make crepes I've made a
dish<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.079> batter<00:00:54.170> actually<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> made<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> last

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
dish of batter actually I made it last

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.729 
dish of batter actually I made it last
night<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:57.420> need<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> refrigerate<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
night and you do need to refrigerate the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.439 
night and you do need to refrigerate the
batter<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> only<00:00:59.670> time<00:01:00.120> where<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
batter this is the only time where you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.200

really<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.109> ahead<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
really need to think ahead so that the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.100 
really need to think ahead so that the
flour<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:04.250> absorb<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> liquid<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
flour will absorb the liquid and so you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.690 
flour will absorb the liquid and so you
end<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> batch<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> batter<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:09.299> this
