 it went to us what else is this 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.170
 the end 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.110
 just no matter how a woman does two 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:37.250
 such boxes 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:43.310
 Well, that 's the sum that the actor said 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.170
 simple playstation slim circuit like me 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 would drive the name more comfortably open 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.450
 you press 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.970
 stop and here you are the same why is it convenient 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.890
 there is a station with a simple movie there like 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.070
 he hits and comes around often swimming bodies 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.430
 Only there is the fact that he when 500 gigabytes 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:11.560
 I had a choice to remember this or 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.709
 this with two and them or meaning and your 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.709
 holiday sports 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.280
 points should 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:03:21.709
 it's exactly like abdullina 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:52.130
 to charge like i kept fox 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.130
 the simplest result 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:02.080
 draw 1 there 2 purchase or joystick 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:19.650
 key in general joystick is minutes 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:19.650
 by playstation liked more ours 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.910
 Well, if only the console itself 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.910
 then console 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.289
 wait for us 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.849
 herself 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:57.660
 Suslin as you can see 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.660
 fighting a cheetah a-shane 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:08.680
 made just stewing thinly take 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:11.280
 so this cable has written on this 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.460
 to play on the internet he has a cache 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.670
 unclenching 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:22.170
 I don't know what it is but just 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:22.170
 and you and this one so much power here 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:34.150
 so here is an apple how much am I 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:38.010
 Honestly that's why I'm all 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.010
 it seems that it is higher than the village 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.699
 different 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:07:14.909
 because randomness is not 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:20.379
 I liked it probably so these boxes 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:22.289
 when I pulled out the console itself want 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:28.209
 can like 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:30.159
 children are crazy I do not care with 

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:33.659

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.659
