00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.799
 Good day my viewers 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.690
 channel today we are considering 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 soviet record player 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.820
 radio engineering 001 got this 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.660
 copy in principle condition 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.769
 pretty good at least 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.449
 outwardly there is a small split of veneer with 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.320
 right side i.e. the body is enough 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:37.620
 good condition campo of course 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.829
 scratched I would appreciate advice about 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 how is this a disgrace from the project 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.010
 polish him 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:07.940
 initial inspection showed no 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:14.090
 apiary off absence apiary further 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.460
 so there was no bearing water 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 thank god and apiaries and bearing 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:29.680
 I had spare bearing from 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:34.350
 radio engineering 101 from am not mistaken a apiary 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.710
 on t30 from it to be played already 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.710
 long lay 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.509
 we return back a problem from 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 strobe light 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:05.280
 totally incomprehensible how how on it 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.929
 determine the rotational speed since 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.220
 he did not burn on 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:14.549
 player needs prevention cleaning 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 electrolytic lecture replacement lubricant 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:25.489
 capacitors well, and generally see what 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:31.910
 how can there be anything else 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:35.510
 problem with tonearm broken mount 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.510
 Now I will try to show 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.499
 plastic ear but not broken off 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.659
 enough, too, I would appreciate if 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:03:01.780
 You advise what can be here and 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:01.780
 here we are going to replace 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:12.469
 deal with a replacement strobe 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:17.989
 capacitors subscribe to my 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:22.010
 I hope the channel will be video repair 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.579
 of this coil repair machine 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.689
 tape recorders amplifiers in general 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.930
 various Soviet audio equipment total 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.930
 kind
