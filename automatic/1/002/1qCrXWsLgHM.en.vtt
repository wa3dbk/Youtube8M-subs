burner<00:02:09.840> first<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> make<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> light<00:02:11.190> outline<00:02:11.640> with

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
burner first I make a light outline with

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.210 
burner first I make a light outline with
a<00:02:11.849> cone<00:02:12.150> point<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.349> go<00:02:13.500> over<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.830> again<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
a cone point then I go over it again a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.880 
a cone point then I go over it again a
little<00:02:14.520> slower<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.120> thicker<00:02:15.360> line<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
little slower for a thicker line the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350 
little slower for a thicker line the
slower<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.370> move<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.670> pin<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.030> thicker<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
slower you move the pin the thicker the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.910 
slower you move the pin the thicker the
line

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.650 

after<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.220> nice<00:02:23.520> outline<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.240> straighten

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
after I got a nice outline I straighten

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.210 
after I got a nice outline I straighten
up<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> lines<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.319> universal<00:02:25.980> point

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
up the lines with the universal point

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.699 
up the lines with the universal point
and<00:02:26.490> that's<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.080> pretty<00:02:28.319> simple

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
and that's it it's a pretty simple

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.410 
and that's it it's a pretty simple
process

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.699 

next<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> apply<00:02:33.959> wood<00:02:34.260> stain<00:02:34.560> to

next I'm going to apply wood stain to

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.979 
next I'm going to apply wood stain to
the<00:02:34.830> exterior<00:02:35.220> let<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.180> sit<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.540> about<00:02:36.629> 10

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the exterior let it sit for about 10

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.690 
the exterior let it sit for about 10
minutes<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:37.860> wipe<00:02:38.040> off<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.400> excess

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
minutes and then wipe off the excess

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.240 
minutes and then wipe off the excess
stain<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:40.410> I'm<00:02:40.530> going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.800> finish<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.220> with

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
stain then I'm going to finish it with

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.850 
stain then I'm going to finish it with
polyurethane<00:02:42.230> polyurethane<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.379> similar<00:02:43.709> to

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
wood stain in that it is oil-based and

wood stain in that it is oil-based and
absorbs<00:02:45.989> into<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> wood<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.220> dries<00:02:47.459> into

absorbs into the wood but it dries into
a<00:02:47.790> hard<00:02:48.150> seal<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.629> will<00:02:48.750> protect<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.230> wood

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
a hard seal that will protect the wood
