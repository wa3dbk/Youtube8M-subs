it works out so this is my grill I see
here<00:02:24.250> where<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.900> take<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.959> luminol<00:02:26.290> oil<00:02:26.530> to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
here where I take a luminol oil to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.820 
here where I take a luminol oil to
increase<00:02:27.490> brightness<00:02:28.380> over<00:02:29.380> here<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.650> another

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
increase brightness over here is another

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.900 
increase brightness over here is another
thing<00:02:30.040> you're<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> little<00:02:30.340> bit<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.490> oil<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
thing you're a little bit of oil and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.760 
thing you're a little bit of oil and
there's<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> hundred<00:02:31.480> watt<00:02:31.600> bulb<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.590> other

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
there's a hundred watt bulb on the other

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.070 
there's a hundred watt bulb on the other
side<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.300> right<00:02:34.480> down<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.050> a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
side of that so right down here I have a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.430 
side of that so right down here I have a
treble<00:02:35.590> light<00:02:35.800> no<00:02:36.490> more<00:02:36.610> trouble<00:02:36.940> light<00:02:37.440> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
treble light no more trouble light it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.670 
treble light no more trouble light it's
got<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:40.450> reflector<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> back<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.560> it

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
got a little reflector on the back of it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.370 
got a little reflector on the back of it
but<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:43.030> got<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.270> keep<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.540> lights<00:02:43.720> close<00:02:44.080> as

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
but you got to keep the lights close as

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.570 
but you got to keep the lights close as
you<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.650> get<00:02:44.800> them<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.040> can't<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.430> them<00:02:45.520> as

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
you can get them I can't get them as

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.430 
you can get them I can't get them as
close<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:45.970> one<00:02:46.209> I'm<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.140> doesn't

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
close to that one I'm but it doesn't

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.110 
close to that one I'm but it doesn't
seem<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.739> matter<00:02:47.890> these<00:02:48.130> plants<00:02:48.610> are<00:02:48.700> really

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
seem to matter these plants are really

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.340 
seem to matter these plants are really
growing<00:02:49.390> at<00:02:49.989> good<00:02:50.260> fertilized<00:02:50.800> soil<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.420> this

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
growing at good fertilized soil so this

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.290 
growing at good fertilized soil so this
is<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.620> make<00:02:53.950> sure<00:02:54.160> when<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.459> if<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:54.670> go<00:02:55.120> ahead

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
is it make sure when you if you go ahead

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.180 
is it make sure when you if you go ahead
and<00:02:55.390> try<00:02:55.570> compact<00:02:56.140> fluorescents<00:02:56.650> start<00:02:56.920> with

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and try compact fluorescents start with

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.610 
and try compact fluorescents start with
for<00:02:57.670> sure<00:02:57.700> soft<00:02:58.150> light<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.959> use<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.350> hundred

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
for sure soft light and use the hundred

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.740 
for sure soft light and use the hundred
watt<00:02:59.769> equivalent<00:02:59.920> 23<00:03:00.820> or<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.120> lot<00:03:01.360> bulbs

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
watt equivalent 23 or so lot bulbs

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.390 
watt equivalent 23 or so lot bulbs
they're<00:03:02.470> your<00:03:02.650> best<00:03:02.860> bet<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.070> get<00:03:03.190> them<00:03:03.280> for

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
they're your best bet you get them for

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.900 
they're your best bet you get them for
less<00:03:03.580> than<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.790> buck<00:03:03.820> apiece<00:03:04.060> at<00:03:04.390> Walmart<00:03:04.780> and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
less than a buck apiece at Walmart and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.150 
less than a buck apiece at Walmart and
they<00:03:06.910> don't<00:03:07.060> cost<00:03:07.269> much<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.860> don't<00:03:09.010> have

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
they don't cost much just don't have

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.979 
they don't cost much just don't have
kittens<00:03:09.459> around<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.120> keep<00:03:10.570> tearing

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
kittens around that can keep tearing

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.860 
kittens around that can keep tearing
down<00:03:11.140> your<00:03:11.370> mylar<00:03:12.810> sliding<00:03:13.810> off<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.260> strategy
