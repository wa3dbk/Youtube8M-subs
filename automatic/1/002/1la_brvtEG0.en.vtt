designed an action to help correct this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.130 
designed an action to help correct this
problem<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> let's<00:00:40.230> zoom<00:00:40.350> back<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:42.140> we'll

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
problem so let's zoom back out and we'll

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.310 
problem so let's zoom back out and we'll
select<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.800> chromatic<00:00:44.399> aberration<00:00:45.090> remover

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.500 

now<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.550> there's<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.149> lot

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
now as you can see on here there's a lot

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
now as you can see on here there's a lot
of<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:51.930> bright<00:00:52.170> greens<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.949> bright

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250

of really bright greens and bright
magenta<00:00:53.489> x'<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.210> we're<00:00:54.360> concerned<00:00:54.690> with

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
magenta x' but what we're concerned with

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
magenta x' but what we're concerned with
are<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> ones<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> place<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
are the ones that are out of place you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
are the ones that are out of place you
can<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:56.940> along<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.480> Ridge<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.079> I'll

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
can see along this Ridge right here I'll

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580 
can see along this Ridge right here I'll
zoom<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.719> you<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> spot<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.469> were

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
zoom back in you see that spot we were

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
zoom back in you see that spot we were
just<00:01:01.739> looking<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.309> highlights<00:01:02.969> where<00:01:03.239> they

are so I'll zoom back out and we want to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
are so I'll zoom back out and we want to

says turn this layer off and we can go

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
says turn this layer off and we can go
ahead<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.000> flatten<00:01:51.179> our<00:01:51.450> image<00:01:55.069> now<00:01:56.069> if<00:01:56.219> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
ahead and flatten our image now if you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.919 
ahead and flatten our image now if you
zoom<00:01:56.340> back<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:58.850> those<00:01:59.850> chromatic<00:02:00.360> aberrations

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
zoom back in those chromatic aberrations

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.510 
zoom back in those chromatic aberrations
are<00:02:01.079> gone<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.530> next<00:02:04.709> let's<00:02:04.950> move<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
are gone so next let's move on to a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.819 
are gone so next let's move on to a
foundation<00:02:05.789> action<00:02:06.539> I'll<00:02:06.689> come<00:02:07.319> up<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
foundation action I'll come up here and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.259 
foundation action I'll come up here and
I<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.160> run<00:02:08.369> subtle<00:02:09.119> edit<00:02:09.360> color<00:02:09.569> base<00:02:11.269> you

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
I will run subtle edit color base you

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.789 
I will run subtle edit color base you
can<00:02:12.420> see<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> cleaned<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> image<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
can see that it cleaned the image up a
