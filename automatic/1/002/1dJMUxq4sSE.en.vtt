00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
is like move this hand backwards you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270 
is like move this hand backwards you
twist<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.060> around<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:49.190> whenever<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
twist it around like that whenever you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.650 
twist it around like that whenever you
get<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> yourself<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.239> flick<00:00:51.510> your

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.969 

and<00:01:49.390> then<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:51.220> can<00:01:51.340> learn<00:01:51.490> them<00:01:51.640> flat<00:01:51.909> or<00:01:52.979> out

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
and then you can learn them flat or out

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.430 
and then you can learn them flat or out
of<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.190> bank<00:01:54.430> or<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> quarter<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.260> little

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
of a bank or a quarter in the little

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.550 
of a bank or a quarter in the little
bowl<00:01:56.620> like<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.130> use<00:01:57.250> did<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.990> you're<00:01:59.170> just

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
bowl like I use did and if you're just

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.680 
bowl like I use did and if you're just
beginning<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.190> learn<00:02:00.369> them<00:02:00.580> I'd<00:02:01.300> find<00:02:01.540> just

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
beginning to learn them I'd find just

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
beginning to learn them I'd find just
like<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.810> little<00:02:01.960> rant<00:02:02.229> like<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.440> kicker

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
like a little rant like a kicker

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.070 
like a little rant like a kicker
something<00:02:03.369> small<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.690> don't<00:02:04.810> have<00:02:04.900> too

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
something small so you don't have too

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.960 
something small so you don't have too
much<00:02:05.170> air<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.369> just<00:02:06.400> practice<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
much air and you just practice the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.400 
much air and you just practice the
motion<00:02:07.150> like<00:02:07.479> whenever<00:02:07.690> you're<00:02:07.900> just<00:02:08.050> sitting

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
motion like whenever you're just sitting

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
motion like whenever you're just sitting
around<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:10.270> motion<00:02:10.660> dialed<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.860> then<00:02:12.340> you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
around the motion dialed and then you

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.980 
around the motion dialed and then you
feel<00:02:12.880> you're<00:02:13.060> comfortable<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.600> motion

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
feel you're comfortable with the motion

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.280 
feel you're comfortable with the motion
then<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.610> find<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.030> ramp<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.360> throw

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
then you can just find a ramp and throw

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.520 
then you can just find a ramp and throw
it<00:02:18.510> by<00:02:19.510> line<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> pretty<00:02:20.050> soon<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.410> have

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
it by line it pretty soon if you have

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.010 
it by line it pretty soon if you have
the<00:02:20.620> bus<00:02:20.770> right
