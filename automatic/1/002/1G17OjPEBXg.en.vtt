00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 ah 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.179
 hello today we are going to see in infor speed the 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.799
 series in which people 1994 and always 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.779
 has been characterized by luxury cars 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.400
 to return super high speed and 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.320
 also in persecutions with advertising 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.369
 and in fact this is game number 20 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.369
 which is quite surprising 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.680
 a few years ago electronic arts joined 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 competitive in games who were the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.430
 responsible for werner that is a great 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 franchise and together they created some gloves 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.379
 which is one of the favorites of 2010 and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.720
 then they did the remake of mount water 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.430
 in 2012 and this year they bring me 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.230
 profile drivers that is indeed done 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 for the golf game which is an excellent 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 quite and bill gates and electronic arts in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.629
 sweden so let's see how it is but 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.829
 He passed them the trick more 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.829
 spectacular of the series 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.300
 Starter is given the option to choose 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 between being a policeman or a runner and once 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 done this will free you in the big map 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.700
 derby county an open world full of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.530
 curvy tracks that encourage you to go 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.030
 at full speed and walking 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.550
 scenarios like mountains beaches 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 deserts without forests being police is the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.030
 simplest part of the game where you get 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.950
 reward with points every time you catch 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.230
 runners but the star of the show 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.000
 is in the other campaign to be a runner 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.650
 activates a score multiplier that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.570
 drastically increases the amount of 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.800
 speed points that you can accumulate 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.780
 but doing so also increases the level 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.090
 of the police search what makes the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.800
 game considerably more difficult the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.780
 trick is that if you destroy your car or 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.190
 you get caught in advertising you lose all 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 the points that you accumulate in that round 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.270
 the balance that is created between the risk 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.920
 to be captured and get more 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 score is one of the most 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 stimulants of experience the picks 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 in envelope they serve to buy new 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.410
 better weapons cars and improve your 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.940
 vehicles at the same time the structure 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.650
 of the mini missions makes you stay 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.270
 stuck for hours as it always seems 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.800
 that you were about to raise the level 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.020
 and unlock a new super vehicle 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.480
 the controls feel very good that is 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.160
 it's not just about the workshop 4 that super 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.810
 comfortable but the game itself is very well 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.670
 calibrated and you feel each of the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 curves when you hit or when you crash 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.590
 you feel the car now destroys 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.510
 and we want to know quickly how well 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.280
 the rhythm of playstation wii works 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.870
 is competition 4 what it does is is the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.030
 vitesse stream and nord that processes the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.000
 precision 4 then if someone needs 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.830
 use a television or need to go to 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.959
 another quarter or they can even go to the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.400
 bathroom can have the game and do not lose 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.620
 only no detail and it works 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.569
 surprisingly well the graphics are 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.819
 incredible thanks to the graphic engine 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.230
 frostbite 3 the amount of particles and 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.659
 layers that you see on many screens 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.310
 Sometimes they left me with their mouths open 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.379
 another surprising thing is that it does not exist 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.049
 a separate multiplayer mode everything is 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.730
 integrated in a single game mode the 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.650
 Audi drive system creates an online world 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 to the world of warcraft where in everything 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.190
 moment you have runners challenging teal 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.650
 racing or chasing you like cops 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.810
 but to have such an open and free world 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.280
 has its consequences there are some 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.560
 parts of the game that do not tell you very 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.209
 well where to go something to do and the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.129
 advanced events are ruthlessly 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.409
 difficult where there is not always a button 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.970
 of start what bothered me most was the 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.980
 inconsistency of the police as 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.620
 many times a persecution was renewed 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.030
 and had not a policeman in sight that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.560
 It will take about 20 hours to finish the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.480
 main missions of both campaigns 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.800
 but thanks to the online system 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 if they have friends that constantly 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.390
 you play they will also remain stuck 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.340
 until they stop doing my profile 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.959
 has never been characterized as being a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.810
 real simulator as it is 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.519
 forza motorsport or gran turismo but ss 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.810
 no realism which allows creating the 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.120
 persecutions and the most careers 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.470
 spectacular that I have played at the level of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.420
 graphics connectivity with others 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.069
 players and number of events this is 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.069
 the most attractive package on the market 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.580
 so traits is not perfect but it's a 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.870
 continuous adrenaline bombardment and it's 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.000
 for me racing game 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.260
 fun and entertaining this year like this 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.300
 that I recommend it is available 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.340
 for playstation3 xbox 360 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.050
 and if they wanted a nice graphic on pc 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.050
 xbox one and playstation 4
