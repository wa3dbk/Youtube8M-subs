the<00:07:04.340> first<00:07:04.460> video<00:07:04.639> I<00:07:05.349> realized<00:07:06.349> that<00:07:06.830> I

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
the first video I realized that I

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.760

replaced 30 restaurants with two of the
brick<00:07:25.310> right<00:07:25.460> and<00:07:25.760> one<00:07:26.419> last<00:07:26.719> car<00:07:26.930> drove<00:07:27.080> on
