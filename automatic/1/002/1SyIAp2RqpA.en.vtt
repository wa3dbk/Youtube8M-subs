00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.220
 how about people to be my first video 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.219
 the theme that we are going to have today is 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.500
 about the red light of death how 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.580
 take out the game he got a game of a 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 friend of space 2 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.410
 and well let's do the tutorial for 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.450
 to be able to get it out we just need a couple of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.310
 very small tools we would need 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.900
 two types of screwdrivers 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 so if you can see it right there in the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 camera my girlfriend is already a cameraman 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.000
 a little kiss for her 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.890
 I love a lot 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.750
 they have two types of externalities in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.640
 cross Look what is given more 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.430
 adaptable for any doubt try to have 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.860
 type one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.620
 a tool box like that is not 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.630
 difficult for nothing and this is important 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.580
 we need a small screwdriver 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.840
 shovel very small because we go in a 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.470
 series of screws that we have to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.600
 remove with great care 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.640
 good first what they have to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.370
 do is realize if they have a guarantee 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.200
 or is not the most important because 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.330
 If they have a guarantee, the best thing is that 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.000
 you go to the site of did the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.620
 service and ask them to bail them 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 this is for when and the guarantee 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.520
 it expired and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.740
 good they have to do it for you not 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 they want to spend money then this is a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.370
 small tutorial for this first 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.980
 remove the sticker has already expired 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.950
 guarantee now we need this kind of 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.380
 test burner door that in such a case 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.660
 you already have it if you do not think about 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.080
 some friend is a six screwdriver 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.080
 tips 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.850
 and it came out 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.710
 it's not the first screw a very thing 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.810
 important each screw that you that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.080
 they have to organize it in an order by 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.940
 example screw one starts from 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.010
 right left later we have 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.990
 to remove the lid 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.670
 easy no inconvenient type 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.940
 we came back to organize this kind of 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.940
 things 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.320
 good perfect now they grab a screw 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 four - pointed star and start 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.789
 12 calle screw has no will 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.789
 they took 3 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.270
 4 5 and 6 all these terms that 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.580
 brothers so that finally finally if 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.580
 we put the second layer 2 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.830
 at a certain moment they will not be able to take 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.780
 some are going to have to give them to and 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.890
 then spin it around make sure 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.890
 know what screws 4 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.540
 these all have the same size 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:53.400
 so general then there's no 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.400
 no problem if you get confused in these 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.560
 we have six long screws and one 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.750
 small that would be the primary of this 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.870
 part that retains the lid and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.640
 keeps the press iron and all 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.690
 well later we will try to 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.490
 open it on this side 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.100
 we proceed to lift it 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:27.880
 gently 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.880
 or hard as you want to use more alone 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.960
 Me who 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.920
 so this is the first 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.900
 but this is important 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.250
 here they are going to be a little lost 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.250
 worry do not find out 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.490
 everything that is connected can be 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.260
 disconnect 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.260
 then we remove 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.200
 if you do not get the corrective strip in the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.200
 another round 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.480
 perfect we remove the first one is already 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.450
 release this stage so we can 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.040
 move to another side and we can come to 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.080
 center of the problem that would come to be 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.200
 this 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.630
 this 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.859
 if they can lift it without any kind of 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.620
 not to play 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.650
 except for these two cables first 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.190
 which is removed in the same way as the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.250
 earlier than removing this black layer 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.520
 it is pulled up and when it is pulled 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.250
 directly loosens this and this is the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.850
 circuit system you just have to 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.850
 disconnect it 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.510
 perfect you can see we have a 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:49.610
 reader unit here separates 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.260
 directly disconnected from the play and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.830
 we move away from the area that we do not want 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.830
 use more 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.150
 and so you have done a service 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.990
 directly to the way to do it 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.940
 just take precautions of what 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.250
 disconnected to reconnect and 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.400
 clean everything and in such a case that you 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.870
 needs to make some change and has 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.270
 a friend who has some spare him 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.430
 can you do manually already 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.080
 between little we will explain other forms 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.860
 some doubt any query in the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.860
 writing on this channel 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.539
 well here we have the second 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.050
 inconvenient we have these two 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:30.439
 screws that are very, very small 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.590
 that would really be this and this I do not know 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:38.090
 if reach a camera our health 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.090
 we will try to remove them 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.820
 can be a shovel our motto be 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.820
 same 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.099
 look how small it is so have 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.409
 very careful the space where they work 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.909
 that is not a carpet or some kind of 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.520
 this we see that if it is a floor that is 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.980
 smooth any kind of convenient and 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:04.350
 we organize another our screws 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.350
 we go to the second 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.519
 is the second 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:19.579
 well now we remove again this is 

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:22.579
 It serves as a quiet lever without any 

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:26.079
 type of inconveniences and here in here 

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:26.079
 is our little game 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.020
 first we removed this 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.210
 and then 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.390
 we have to remove two screws here 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.490
 one that is in this part 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.400
 and another one that is in this part 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.620
 when we remove it we are going to move 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.009
 part of the reader and there we will find 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:51.210
 We can not remove the disc 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.210
 this leaves easy 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.270
 they have a screw that is very small if 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.250
 I reiterate with the order because it is 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.780
 preferable to be a little ordered and not 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.070
 we miss any screw because if 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.200
 then we can not go back to the 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.770
 play and so we're going to have a little 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.770
 problem 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.879
 we remove the second screw make the 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.879
 they have 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:38.280
 the game can I claim 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:41.120
 space pegasus I recommend it 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.050
 and later to this unarmed 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.360
 obviously now it has to be all of 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.340
 return 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.289
 but do not worry if you want 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.939
 use your play quietly can 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.630
 back to the sea I do not think there's any 

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:54.150
 type of inconvenience 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.060
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.590
 have served them at another time upload 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.620
 some other video thank you all for the 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.570
 chicken but it's called one but 

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.550
 good if you're who heap 

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.550
 hugs kisses
