this<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.880> probably<00:01:05.880> wouldn't<00:01:06.420> show<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this one I probably wouldn't show you

even if I could transform it on camera
it's<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> does<00:01:11.100> anything

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
it's not that it does anything

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.289 
it's not that it does anything
particularly<00:01:11.729> clever<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:15.030> at

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
particularly clever but it is so good at

better than some transformers are and
