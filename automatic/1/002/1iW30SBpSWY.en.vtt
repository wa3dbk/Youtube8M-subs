everywhere<00:01:26.509> anyway<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> crutch

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
everywhere anyway and it's just a crutch

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
everywhere anyway and it's just a crutch
chemicals<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.990> have

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
chemicals that yeah like that and have

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
chemicals that yeah like that and have
already<00:01:31.320> used<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.729> first<00:01:32.970> car

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
already used it but it was my first car

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.740 
already used it but it was my first car
and<00:01:33.740> every<00:01:34.740> using<00:01:35.189> French<00:01:35.579> many<00:01:35.820> concepts<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and every using French many concepts and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
and every using French many concepts and
I've<00:01:37.049> never<00:01:37.200> actually<00:01:37.439> used<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.040> French

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I've never actually used a French

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.090 
I've never actually used a French
manicure<00:01:38.490> set<00:01:39.030> before<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.950> did

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
manicure set before so I think we did

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.080 
manicure set before so I think we did
what<00:01:41.400> good<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> first

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
what good for the first

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.630 
what good for the first
I'm<00:01:44.090> just<00:01:45.130> not<00:01:46.600> right

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.480 

I<00:01:50.500> mean<00:01:51.500> if<00:01:52.370> you<00:01:52.550> just<00:01:52.760> bad

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
I mean if you just bad

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.149 
I mean if you just bad
but<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.540> not<00:01:55.659> actually<00:01:56.110> exactly<00:01:56.470> amazing

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
but it's not actually exactly amazing

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
but it's not actually exactly amazing
