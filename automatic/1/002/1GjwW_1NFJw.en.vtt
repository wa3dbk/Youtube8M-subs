going to be childbearing but we're going
to<00:07:01.330> be<00:07:01.480> like<00:07:01.630> the<00:07:01.810> angels<00:07:02.230> in<00:07:02.440> heaven<00:07:03.060> so<00:07:04.060> you

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
to be like the angels in heaven so you

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.300 
to be like the angels in heaven so you
see<00:07:04.360> those<00:07:04.570> those<00:07:05.080> two<00:07:05.380> events<00:07:05.530> have<00:07:05.980> to<00:07:06.160> be

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
see those those two events have to be

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.710 
see those those two events have to be
separated<00:07:06.990> by<00:07:07.990> a<00:07:08.020> period<00:07:08.620> of<00:07:08.860> some<00:07:09.100> time<00:07:09.400> and

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
separated by a period of some time and

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.570 
separated by a period of some time and
the<00:07:10.720> only<00:07:11.050> logical<00:07:11.530> place<00:07:12.100> and<00:07:12.310> I've<00:07:12.370> got<00:07:12.550> a

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
the only logical place and I've got a

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.580 
the only logical place and I've got a
book<00:07:12.760> I<00:07:12.940> wrote<00:07:13.090> in<00:07:13.270> this<00:07:13.450> call<00:07:13.690> a<00:07:13.960> vanished

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
book I wrote in this call a vanished

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.710 
book I wrote in this call a vanished
which<00:07:15.280> goes<00:07:15.550> into<00:07:15.580> all<00:07:15.880> the<00:07:16.060> theological

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
which goes into all the theological

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.960 
which goes into all the theological
details<00:07:17.140> in<00:07:17.440> the<00:07:18.010> simplest<00:07:18.280> manner<00:07:18.610> that<00:07:18.940> I

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
details in the simplest manner that I

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.810 
details in the simplest manner that I
could<00:07:19.210> put<00:07:19.360> them<00:07:19.480> and<00:07:19.750> I<00:07:20.650> show<00:07:21.310> that<00:07:21.580> they're

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
could put them and I show that they're

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.950 
could put them and I show that they're
all<00:07:21.850> kinds<00:07:22.840> of<00:07:22.990> differences<00:07:23.580> between<00:07:24.960> this

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
all kinds of differences between this

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.370 
all kinds of differences between this
event<00:07:26.770> where<00:07:27.010> he<00:07:27.250> takes<00:07:27.640> one<00:07:27.970> and<00:07:28.300> leaves<00:07:29.110> and

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
event where he takes one and leaves and

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.360 
event where he takes one and leaves and
leaves<00:07:30.070> the<00:07:30.280> other<00:07:30.430> one<00:07:31.180> in<00:07:32.010> two<00:07:33.010> people

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.370 
leaves the other one in two people

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.620 
leaves the other one in two people
working<00:07:33.550> to<00:07:33.730> feel<00:07:33.880> one<00:07:34.120> taking<00:07:34.420> the<00:07:34.540> other

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.630 
working to feel one taking the other

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.270 
working to feel one taking the other
left<00:07:34.900> the<00:07:35.170> one<00:07:35.320> that's<00:07:35.440> left<00:07:35.710> the<00:07:35.860> unbeliever

that's<00:07:36.790> the<00:07:36.970> one<00:07:37.060> is<00:07:37.270> going<00:07:37.510> to<00:07:37.630> go<00:07:38.320> through

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
that's the one is going to go through

that's the one is going to go through
the<00:07:38.650> tribulation<00:07:39.480> so<00:07:41.250> that<00:07:42.250> roughly<00:07:42.700> is

the tribulation so that roughly is

the tribulation so that roughly is
