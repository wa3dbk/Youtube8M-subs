now<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.159> very<00:00:02.280> different<00:00:05.750> category<00:00:06.750> of

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
now in a very different category of

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.940 
now in a very different category of
illusion<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.950> worth

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
illusion and this is one worth

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.430 
illusion and this is one worth
considering<00:00:11.940> because<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.139> tend

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
considering because it's the one we tend

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.150 
considering because it's the one we tend
not<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.920> place<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:16.020> category<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
not to place in this category and that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
not to place in this category and that
is<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.420> illusion<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.560> materialism<00:00:20.539> this<00:00:21.539> has

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
is the illusion of materialism this has

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.679 
is the illusion of materialism this has
broken<00:00:22.170> down<00:00:22.609> completely<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:25.650> idea<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:27.480> the
