00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
featuring this the McLaren 12c I wanted

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.780 
featuring this the McLaren 12c I wanted
to<00:00:07.290> go<00:00:07.410> into<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> phase<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.189> doing<00:00:08.490> super

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
to go into the phase of doing super

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.740 
to go into the phase of doing super
carrots<00:00:09.059> because<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.269> bunch<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.660> have

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
carrots because a bunch of you have

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.259 
carrots because a bunch of you have
actually<00:00:09.870> asked<00:00:10.139> me<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.290> do<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> few<00:00:10.559> supercars

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
actually asked me to do a few supercars

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.089 
actually asked me to do a few supercars
so<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:12.870> starting<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.440> little<00:00:13.679> sort<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
so I'm starting that little sort of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
so I'm starting that little sort of
phase<00:00:14.370> now<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> first<00:00:16.170> car<00:00:16.320> that

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
phase now so this is the first car that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.170 
phase now so this is the first car that
I<00:00:16.500> chose<00:00:16.680> after<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.160> tuned<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.640> looks

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
I chose after I've tuned it it looks

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.170 
I chose after I've tuned it it looks
like<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.369> looks<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.730> like

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
like this I like the way it looks I like

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.609 
like this I like the way it looks I like
the<00:00:21.300> blue<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> wheels<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.500> way

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the blue I like the wheels the way

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.230 
the blue I like the wheels the way
they're<00:00:22.830> back<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> they're<00:00:23.490> sort<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.789> concave

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
they're back and they're sort of concave

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
they're back and they're sort of concave
you<00:00:24.420> know<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.340> I

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
you know they go in and I don't know I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.679 
you know they go in and I don't know I
think<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.849> looks<00:00:26.880> good<00:00:27.119> overall<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.539> can't

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
think it looks good overall you can't

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.620 
think it looks good overall you can't
really<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.930> much<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.800> supercars

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
really do much to the supercars

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.310 
really do much to the supercars
specifically<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.840> when<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.080> can't<00:00:31.230> really

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
specifically this when you can't really

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
specifically this when you can't really
do<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.529> too<00:00:32.160> much<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.700> how's<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> key

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
do it too much to it so how's the key

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150 
do it too much to it so how's the key
little<00:00:33.270> cabin<00:00:33.600> split<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
little cabin split at the back which is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220 
little cabin split at the back which is
the<00:00:35.219> exact<00:00:35.430> same<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> normal<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.329> it's

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the exact same as a normal one but it's

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.900 
the exact same as a normal one but it's
just<00:00:37.290> made<00:00:37.469> out<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> carbon<00:00:37.829> fiber<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.430> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
just made out of carbon fiber and you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
just made out of carbon fiber and you
know<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.180> actual<00:00:39.870> clear<00:00:40.110> carbon

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
know it's just actual clear carbon

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.720 
know it's just actual clear carbon
fibers<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.070> painted<00:00:41.370> over<00:00:41.460> anything

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
fibers not like painted over anything

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
fibers not like painted over anything
but<00:00:42.030> anyway<00:00:42.270> let's<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.110> onto<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> set<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
but anyway let's get onto the set up so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.200 
but anyway let's get onto the set up so
I<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.010> show<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> guys<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.399> I've<00:00:44.550> done<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
I can show you guys what I've done it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.260 
I can show you guys what I've done it
has<00:00:45.420> 630<00:00:46.050> brake<00:00:46.260> horsepower<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.910> 1105<00:00:47.910> kilos

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
has 630 brake horsepower and 1105 kilos

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.260 
has 630 brake horsepower and 1105 kilos
now<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:49.579> added<00:00:50.579> any<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:51.000> power<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
now I have not added any more power to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.490 
now I have not added any more power to
this<00:00:51.390> thing<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.719> I've<00:00:51.840> done<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:52.140> changed<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this thing all I've done was changed the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
this thing all I've done was changed the
oil<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.800> adds<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:53.910> more

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
oil so that adds like a little bit more

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
oil so that adds like a little bit more
horsepower<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.629> stock<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> has<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.500> 500

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
horsepower I think stock it has like 500

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.270 
horsepower I think stock it has like 500
90<00:00:56.129> horsepower<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> added<00:00:57.960> around<00:00:58.280> 40

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
90 horsepower so I added around 40

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
90 horsepower so I added around 40
horsepower<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.960> suspension<00:01:01.410> all

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
horsepower and then the suspension all

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
horsepower and then the suspension all
that<00:01:01.620> stuff<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> screen<00:01:03.030> as

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that stuff is there up on the screen as

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
that stuff is there up on the screen as
well<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:04.229> once<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.860> took<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
well now once I took this out on the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
well now once I took this out on the
track<00:01:05.700> um<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.479> didn't<00:01:06.930> expect<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> drift

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
track um I didn't expect it not to drift

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
track um I didn't expect it not to drift
because<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> fact<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
because I know for a fact that the the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240 
because I know for a fact that the the
soup<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.200> any<00:01:10.380> supercar<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.100> would

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
soup I like any supercar that I would

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.410 
soup I like any supercar that I would
take<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> track<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.060> give<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.299> some

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
take out on the track and I give it some

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.630 
take out on the track and I give it some
comfort<00:01:12.750> hard<00:01:12.869> tires<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> sliding

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
comfort hard tires I can get it sliding

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.929 
comfort hard tires I can get it sliding
easily<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:15.930> around<00:01:16.110> sideways

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
easily right they can go around sideways

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.280 
easily right they can go around sideways
probably<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> best<00:01:18.180> care<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> drift<00:01:19.110> in

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
probably not the best care to drift in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
probably not the best care to drift in
but<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.340> around<00:01:20.490> ciders<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
but it can go around ciders it has the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
but it can go around ciders it has the
power<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.689> has<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.200> suspect<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> stiff

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
power to do it has to suspect the stiff

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.300 
power to do it has to suspect the stiff
suspension<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.600> drives<00:01:24.840> great

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
suspension to do it it it drives great

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
suspension to do it it it drives great
but<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.460> once<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.759> tune<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.090> thing<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
but then once they tune this thing it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
but then once they tune this thing it
just<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.090> just

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just is really really good it just

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
just is really really good it just
drives<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.600> any<00:01:30.810> other<00:01:31.049> normal<00:01:31.229> care<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
drives like any other normal care that I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
drives like any other normal care that I
end<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.369> tuning<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.790> drifting<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> its

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
end up tuning for drifting and its

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.999 
end up tuning for drifting and its
really<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.110> good<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.650> didn't<00:01:34.920> have

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
really really good because I didn't have

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
really really good because I didn't have
to<00:01:35.100> add<00:01:35.220> any<00:01:35.400> power<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.659> actually

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to add any power to it and I actually

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.969 
to add any power to it and I actually
didn't<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:37.200> mess<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.650> transmission

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
didn't even mess with the transmission

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.420 
didn't even mess with the transmission
at<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.960> track<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.590> left<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
at all for this track I just left it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
at all for this track I just left it
away<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.299> added<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> fully

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
away it was just added the fully

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530 
away it was just added the fully
customizable<00:01:43.380> suspension<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> left

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
customizable suspension and then I left

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
customizable suspension and then I left
the<00:01:45.899> whatever<00:01:46.470> standard<00:01:46.890> setup<00:01:47.130> that's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the whatever standard setup that's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.450 
the whatever standard setup that's
already<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.210> suspension<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:50.100> drives

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
already on that suspension so it drives

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
already on that suspension so it drives
great<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.570> gears<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.840> perfect<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.380> this

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
great the gears are perfect for this

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.139 
great the gears are perfect for this
track<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> test<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> yourself

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
track if you want to test it yourself

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
track if you want to test it yourself
obviously<00:01:54.780> use<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> same<00:01:55.290> setup<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.710> have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
obviously use the same setup that I have

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
obviously use the same setup that I have
because<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.280> obviously<00:01:56.790> why<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
because that's obviously why I do this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.810 
because that's obviously why I do this
video<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.229> guys<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:59.009> copy<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
video so you guys can copy down the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
video so you guys can copy down the
settings<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.320> own<00:02:01.409> cars

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
settings and put one of your own cars

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.429 
settings and put one of your own cars
and<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.990> dries<00:02:04.200> well

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and see what they like so it dries well

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
a pretty awkward drift car since it's a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.279 
a pretty awkward drift car since it's a
supercar<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> don't<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.080> many

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
supercar you know you don't see many

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.010 
supercar you know you don't see many
supercars<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.120> become<00:02:12.120> actual<00:02:12.480> drift<00:02:12.810> cars

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
supercars just become actual drift cars

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
supercars just become actual drift cars
but

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.059
