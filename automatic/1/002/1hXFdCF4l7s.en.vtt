00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389 

I<00:00:00.089> was<00:00:00.780> out<00:00:00.930> riding<00:00:01.110> with<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.620> buddy<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.370> other

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
I was out riding with my buddy the other

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.840 
I was out riding with my buddy the other
night<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.620> my<00:00:04.620> engine<00:00:04.859> warning<00:00:05.250> light<00:00:05.430> came

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
night and my engine warning light came

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.020 
night and my engine warning light came
on<00:00:06.980> which<00:00:07.980> I'm<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.400> show<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.670> right

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
on which I'm going to show you right

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.560 
on which I'm going to show you right
here<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:11.719> that<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:12.960> there<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:15.560> then<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.770> bike

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
here is that one there and then the bike

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.330 
here is that one there and then the bike
would<00:00:18.570> barely<00:00:18.810> start<00:00:19.320> after<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.680> went<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.920> start

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
would barely start after I went to start

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.450 
would barely start after I went to start
it<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> bump<00:00:22.289> started<00:00:22.650> down<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> hill<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> we

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
it so I bump started down a hill and we

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.279 
it so I bump started down a hill and we
wrote<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> few<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.300> kilometers<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.080> then<00:00:25.170> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
wrote a few more kilometers and then it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.089 
wrote a few more kilometers and then it
just<00:00:25.500> totally<00:00:25.710> died<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> there's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
just totally died out so there's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.299 
just totally died out so there's
obviously<00:00:29.250> something<00:00:29.760> wrong<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.359> electrical

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
obviously something wrong an electrical

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
obviously something wrong an electrical
system<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:35.750> I've<00:00:36.750> seen<00:00:37.050> charged<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> battery

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
system so I've seen charged the battery

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670 
system so I've seen charged the battery
and<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> took<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> charge<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.379> would<00:00:40.379> tend

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and it took a charge so that would tend

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.500 
and it took a charge so that would tend
to<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> battery<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
to think that it's not the battery that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.540 
to think that it's not the battery that
now<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> load<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
now that's with a load on it with the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
now that's with a load on it with the
ignition<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.570> shut<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.840> off<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
ignition on if I shut it off is going to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
ignition on if I shut it off is going to
jump<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> bit<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:50.090> when<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> got<00:00:51.480> home<00:00:51.719> I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
jump up a bit and when I got home I

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.420 
jump up a bit and when I got home I
measured<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> voltage<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> battery<00:00:52.890> was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
measured the voltage of the battery was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360 
measured the voltage of the battery was
eleven<00:00:53.850> point<00:00:54.090> three<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> definitely

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
eleven point three so definitely

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
eleven point three so definitely
something<00:00:56.579> wrong<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> said<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
something wrong with the like I said the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.470 
something wrong with the like I said the
charging<00:00:59.430> circuit<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> battery<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:02.480> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
charging circuit or the battery but it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.420 
charging circuit or the battery but it
looks<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.080> somewhere<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> stator

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
looks like it's somewhere in the stator

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
looks like it's somewhere in the stator
or<00:01:05.760> regulator<00:01:06.350> fuse<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.400> manual<00:01:08.939> says<00:01:09.540> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
or regulator fuse as a manual says this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.160 
or regulator fuse as a manual says this
to<00:01:10.080> check<00:01:11.360> okay<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.780> test<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to check okay now I'm going to test the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
to check okay now I'm going to test the
voltage<00:01:13.290> running<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> guy<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> battery

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
voltage running the guy at the battery

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.990 
voltage running the guy at the battery
place<00:01:15.150> told<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.460> test<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> should<00:01:17.880> be

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
place told me to test and it should be

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.770 
place told me to test and it should be
around<00:01:18.210> fourteen<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> try

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
around fourteen so we're going to try

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
around fourteen so we're going to try
this<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.350> I've<00:01:22.680> already<00:01:22.830> done<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this and I've already done this and it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.230 
this and I've already done this and it
drops<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.890> 12<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> would<00:01:26.700> indicate<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
drops to 12 so that would indicate that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:37.660 
drops to 12 so that would indicate that
the<00:01:27.479> charging<00:01:27.960> system<00:01:28.140> isn't<00:01:28.619> working

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.560 

apply<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.409> would<00:01:39.710> probably<00:01:39.950> go<00:01:40.250> down<00:01:40.640> if

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
apply so that would probably go down if

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.760 
apply so that would probably go down if
I<00:01:41.780> need<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.020> running<00:01:42.380> Wow<00:01:47.530> should<00:01:48.530> be<00:01:48.680> have

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
I need a running Wow should be have

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.859 
I need a running Wow should be have
5,000<00:01:49.520> rpm<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.090> I'm<00:01:50.180> going<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.330> rev<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:50.630> up<00:01:50.720> a

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
5,000 rpm so I'm going to rev it up a

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.980 
5,000 rpm so I'm going to rev it up a
bit

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.880 

that<00:01:56.990> certainly<00:01:57.290> didn't<00:01:57.530> help<00:01:57.560> much<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:59.890> okay

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
that certainly didn't help much so okay

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.100 
that certainly didn't help much so okay
I<00:02:00.920> had<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.130> refer<00:02:01.490> back<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.030> manual<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.900> I

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
I had to refer back to the manual and I

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.210 
I had to refer back to the manual and I
see<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.310> main<00:02:04.549> fuse<00:02:04.970> one<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:06.350> by

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
see that the the main fuse one is is by

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.940 
see that the the main fuse one is is by
the<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.880> battery<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.140> 30<00:02:09.380> amp<00:02:09.619> view

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
the the battery here it's a 30 amp view

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.229 
the the battery here it's a 30 amp view
so<00:02:10.250> that's<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.610> one<00:02:10.759> we<00:02:10.940> got<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> check<00:02:11.950> it's

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
so that's the one we got a check it's

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.570 
so that's the one we got a check it's
right<00:02:14.239> off<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.720> here

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
right off of here

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.370 
right off of here
notice<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:17.150> right<00:02:17.480> probably<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.080> thing

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
notice it's right probably this thing

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.720 
notice it's right probably this thing
here<00:02:20.650> okay<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:22.040> looks<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.550> whole

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
here okay so that looks like this whole

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.460 
here okay so that looks like this whole
block<00:02:23.209> pulls<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.640> don't<00:02:26.020> see<00:02:27.020> why<00:02:27.290> they

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
block pulls out but I don't see why they

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.780 
block pulls out but I don't see why they
would<00:02:27.620> say<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.890> main<00:02:28.070> fuse<00:02:28.459> because<00:02:28.580> you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
would say the main fuse because you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.300 
would say the main fuse because you
would<00:02:28.940> think<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.800> nothing<00:02:30.800> else<00:02:30.980> would<00:02:31.130> be

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
would think that nothing else would be

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.360 
would think that nothing else would be
running<00:02:31.760> if<00:02:31.910> if<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.930> main<00:02:33.110> fuse<00:02:33.530> went<00:02:33.860> but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
running if if the main fuse went but

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.840 
running if if the main fuse went but
anyways<00:02:34.700> we'll<00:02:34.880> test<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.269> all<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.600> same<00:02:36.850> okay

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
anyways we'll test it all the same okay

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.390 
anyways we'll test it all the same okay
we're<00:02:38.330> going<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.540> check<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> fuse

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
we're going to check the fuse

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.020 
we're going to check the fuse
idiot-proof<00:02:40.400> wise<00:02:40.910> by<00:02:41.209> using<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.720> ohmmeter

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
idiot-proof wise by using the ohmmeter

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.140 
idiot-proof wise by using the ohmmeter
alright<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.500> main<00:02:45.980> fuse<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.550> good

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.810 

okay<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.330> main<00:02:50.480> fuses<00:02:50.870> check<00:02:51.170> okay<00:02:51.820> the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
okay the main fuses check okay the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.850 
okay the main fuses check okay the
battery<00:02:53.210> have<00:02:53.420> charged<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.350> took<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.650> good

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
battery have charged and it took a good

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.510 
battery have charged and it took a good
charge

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
charge

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.580 
charge
I<00:02:55.900> used<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.080> Hyperion<00:02:58.240> multi<00:02:59.240> charger<00:02:59.690> which

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
I used a Hyperion multi charger which

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.670 
I used a Hyperion multi charger which
tells<00:03:01.100> me<00:03:01.250> how<00:03:01.370> much<00:03:01.520> charge<00:03:01.790> goes<00:03:02.030> into<00:03:02.360> it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
tells me how much charge goes into it

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.470 
tells me how much charge goes into it
next<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.950> says<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.310> check<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.730> stator<00:03:05.060> coil

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
next it says to check the stator coil

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.240 
next it says to check the stator coil
which<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.960> on<00:03:06.140> page<00:03:07.120> 876<00:03:08.800> checking<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.920> stator

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
which is on page 876 checking the stator

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.750 
which is on page 876 checking the stator
coil<00:03:10.760> okay<00:03:11.660> I'm<00:03:11.870> off<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.230> read<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.580> see<00:03:13.580> where

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
coil okay I'm off the read and see where

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.970 
coil okay I'm off the read and see where
I<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:13.850> find<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:15.340> connector<00:03:16.340> for<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:17.980> okay

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
I can find the connector for that okay

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.360 
I can find the connector for that okay
so<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.340> connector<00:03:19.760> goes<00:03:19.940> up<00:03:21.130> first<00:03:22.130> want<00:03:22.340> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
so the connector goes up first want to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:34.280 
so the connector goes up first want to
check<00:03:22.580> is<00:03:22.700> across<00:03:23.030> one<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.630> two

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.160 

again<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.069> reading<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.550> 1.8<00:03:36.300> ohms<00:03:36.599> which<00:03:36.900> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
again the reading of 1.8 ohms which is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:48.870 
again the reading of 1.8 ohms which is
how<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.709> spec<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:40.549> next<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.670> test<00:03:42.090> across<00:03:42.360> 1<00:03:42.720> &amp;<00:03:42.870> 3

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.940 

it's

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
it's

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.890 
it's
three<00:03:51.550> point<00:03:51.849> 5<00:03:52.120> ohms<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.300> see<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.750> or

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
three point 5 ohms you can see that or

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.839 
three point 5 ohms you can see that or
not<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:58.330> then<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.540> last<00:03:58.720> one<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.340> between<00:04:00.340> 1<00:04:00.640> &amp;

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
not and then the last one is between 1 &amp;

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.330 
not and then the last one is between 1 &amp;
2<00:04:01.110> no<00:04:02.110> joke<00:04:02.739> oh<00:04:03.160> sorry<00:04:03.550> up<00:04:03.760> there<00:04:04.000> 2<00:04:04.239> &amp;<00:04:04.450> 3<00:04:05.340> so

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
2 no joke oh sorry up there 2 &amp; 3 so

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.950 
2 no joke oh sorry up there 2 &amp; 3 so
between<00:04:06.730> 2<00:04:07.060> &amp;<00:04:07.269> 3

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.850 

I<00:04:13.050> get<00:04:13.770> three<00:04:14.100> ohms<00:04:15.110> so<00:04:16.110> according<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
I get three ohms so according to the

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.180 
I get three ohms so according to the
book<00:04:17.190> it's<00:04:17.400> out<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.820> spec<00:04:18.350> yeah<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.650> resistance

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
book it's out of spec yeah so resistance

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.150 
book it's out of spec yeah so resistance
is<00:04:20.340> higher<00:04:21.380> which<00:04:22.380> could<00:04:22.590> mean<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.950> it's

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
is higher which could mean that it's

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.430 
is higher which could mean that it's
burnt<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.850> that's<00:04:24.030> why<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.510> having<00:04:25.170> a<00:04:25.260> tough

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
burnt so that's why it's having a tough

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.660 
burnt so that's why it's having a tough
time<00:04:26.840> going<00:04:27.840> through<00:04:28.200> there<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.740> current

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.270 

okay<00:04:32.670> so<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.940> looks<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.150> my<00:04:34.040> according<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.130> my

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
okay so it looks like my according to my

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.300 
okay so it looks like my according to my
testing<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.260> resistance<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.410> too<00:04:37.620> high<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:38.100> my

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
testing the resistance is too high on my

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.660 
testing the resistance is too high on my
stator<00:04:38.820> which<00:04:39.150> would<00:04:39.360> indicate<00:04:39.570> that's<00:04:39.990> the

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
stator which would indicate that's the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.940 
stator which would indicate that's the
culprit<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:43.380> there<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.830> Ana<00:04:44.070> manual

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
culprit so there it is Ana manual

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.400 
culprit so there it is Ana manual
disassembly<00:04:46.950> diagram<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.750> first<00:04:48.990> step<00:04:49.230> is

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
disassembly diagram so the first step is

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.800 
disassembly diagram so the first step is
to<00:04:49.650> drain<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.340> engine<00:04:50.610> oil<00:04:50.700> luckily<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.600> was

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
to drain the engine oil luckily I was

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.410 
to drain the engine oil luckily I was
due<00:04:51.990> for<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.290> change<00:04:52.560> anyway<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.310> not<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.180> big

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
due for a change anyway so not a big

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.920 
due for a change anyway so not a big
deal<00:04:54.690> there<00:04:56.180> that's<00:04:57.180> kind<00:04:57.420> of<00:04:57.510> tight<00:04:57.750> there

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
deal there that's kind of tight there

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.950 
deal there that's kind of tight there
 drop<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.250> there<00:05:02.370> no<00:05:03.060> but<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.570> got<00:05:03.750> oil

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
 drop it in there no but I got oil

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.580 
 drop it in there no but I got oil
all<00:05:04.230> over<00:05:04.260> myself<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:06.720> wasn't<00:05:07.200> too<00:05:07.320> dirty

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
all over myself and I wasn't too dirty

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.090 
all over myself and I wasn't too dirty
but<00:05:08.780> due<00:05:09.780> for<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> change<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.470> think<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.740> had<00:05:10.920> over

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
but due for a change I think I had over

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.030 
but due for a change I think I had over
between<00:05:11.520> two<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:11.850> three<00:05:11.910> thousand<00:05:12.540> on<00:05:13.040> ok

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
between two and three thousand on ok

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.780 
between two and three thousand on ok
next<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.460> got<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:15.920> loosen<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.040> wiring<00:05:17.430> harness

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
next I got a loosen the wiring harness

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.170 
next I got a loosen the wiring harness
for<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.120> stator<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:20.280> there's<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.580> couple<00:05:20.760> Clips

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
for the stator so there's a couple Clips

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.470 
for the stator so there's a couple Clips
up<00:05:21.390> there<00:05:22.880> connections<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.830> then<00:05:26.100> we<00:05:26.190> got<00:05:26.370> a

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
up there connections and then we got a

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.000 
up there connections and then we got a
pop<00:05:27.480> all<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.780> bolts<00:05:28.260> up<00:05:30.470> this<00:05:31.470> with<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.830> the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
pop all the bolts up this with to the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.670 
pop all the bolts up this with to the
bolts<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:33.570> far<00:05:33.810> they<00:05:33.930> look<00:05:34.080> like<00:05:34.200> on<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.500> same

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
bolts so far they look like on the same

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:47.530 
bolts so far they look like on the same
way<00:05:34.890> that's<00:05:35.610> pretty<00:05:35.850> nice
