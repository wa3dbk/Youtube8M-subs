00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.800
 All a sensational start everyone has said Bayern can only 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.080
 nobody can beat that except dead and now there are two behind today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.849
 keep only one point distance and that has indeed a phase of weakness 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.780
 percent 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 wos draw or lose 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.199
 but what you have to do at Bayern 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.630
 what Procom suddenly in the team 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.400
 that's the same as running 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 No, it's also true that they are different percent 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.209
 Teams as well as in the attitude and so and so aging too 

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.179
 in front 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.690
 occur and dahlem 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.790
 you know also after times 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.650
 Persson women can 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.650
 to stop me and and percent 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.790
 It was already the owner with the title 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 and my little one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.590
 Crisis Janson Lenze Percent will also come out but decide Issel and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.330
 that one percent 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.420
 in the learned and processes that are analyzed and and percent 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.830
 because you are very rarely able to put together good players and potential 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.800
 and skip all the hurdles 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.980
 is also the team internally that comes from the outside of the coach or from 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.079
 by Uli Hoseß or 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.020
 There are a few players who then bore him the team together 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.399
 Summer so it is not so easy so my analysis is when you go against 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.249
 Frankfurt 50 000 cars back now play the major distributors again reads 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:21.469
 percent of these opportunities 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.859
 Warner was maybe the way we did but as well as the roles 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.020
 Back then against Germany we just want to beat them so well 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.880
 perform as a high culture 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.799
 that was ridiculous maybe that was too thin that it was all too 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.170
 easily ran 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.399
 I believe in the team will not have such players in the team 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.070
 in these such characteristics name Mehmet Yildirim in ridiculous of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.030
 guilds 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.280
 it is important to us and that we are in 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 No No play good ball there but then also successful round 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.340
 played against Frankfurt as now and there was none in these to 2 4 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.380
 Discord and and UL and that did not give us the oil the nice game either 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.850
 Corpse and that's why the results we are are normally important 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.619
 if then also a hoes-tor of Frank could 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.269
 or just to be a part of it, it's all the more beautiful 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.939
 but we have to decide that we act as a percent team 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.609
 so that's the way it is when Super Street champion Luca Toni arrives 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.109
 Garrn then makes himself the Italians 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.520
 Percentage in qualifying was cheering on him throughout Italy 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.910
 then comes from Kleber who now clearly a very extraordinary 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.669
 excellent footballer is a technical footballer 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.869
 Percent percent are those who kept in the day care center survive 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.789
 give it like that 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.330
 you draw on eye level all in the team 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.049
 especially a team must be too 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.119
 show that we as 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.419
 So both are heroes 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.419
 so are very very good Tel 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.419
 the guys and ul and nobody 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.879
 it's the next sausage or plattling the extreme show or something 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.899
 and so 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:10.759
 It is also his team then also stands up and killed each below 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.230
 Mail 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.049
 as you can see 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.569
 in these self incomprehensible interests with a first exists however 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.049
 It's been absolutely easy when you got into the eighth new player 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.190
 especially old then too 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.699
 it poured 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:28.429
 the security to say percent where you then then also Aldi must because 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.729
 do it yourself but serves the coach and everyone adapts to and therefore 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.169
 we stand today 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.030
 up there where we want to be good then 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.480
 but especially as a week ago if he is currently 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.069
 Percent for a long time was sometimes provided should also Ottmar Hitzfeld 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.919
 Staying in Munich for sure, as usual you are successful 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.460
 Percent but then there was 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.410
 so sunbathing rotators so they have problem with the rotation 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.410
 and do you want that opera remains Hitzfeld 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.570
 with the rotation 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.049
 for the game world RP 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.049
 Asus but already on 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.840
 sometimes read 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.219
 percent 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.219
 where to put a clamp on a stool outside 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.869
 and on the bench this and Daniel Kuper percent harmed eating the players 

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:33.039
 I do not think so 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.590
 and Pröll 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.110
 giving the coach a Gaida Brenner laudation to take on that 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.349
 APA APA 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.759
 and that's all lies 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.139
 why should one see that in Kiel? 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:54.309
 I believe stretched coach percent white but open to himself then Barnes 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.919
 just a good and percent 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.639
 You have to accept Reindl from the confessor 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.360
 what cause desire will man have for the future and and ul 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.930
 our beautiful factors to keep 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.330
 Percent e where you should be careful then 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.199
 for and percent Isa Scratch percent me very well with the coach Dirk Happe 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.229
 that was with Altintop the first visit here if not very pleased about you 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.860
 Percents what is out of the conversation from her take it and ours too 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.520
 I do not think you should do anything 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.150
 Since I just wish they continue the success they warned now but Bamba 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.090
 win so wish
