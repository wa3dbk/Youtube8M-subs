00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 exactly Allreal from Frankfurt is the first one to go because of her goal 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.500
 First she had an extraordinary dream job, namely medicine 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 studied and did an internship at the hospital as suddenly 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.529
 Rescue helicopter landed right in front of her nose that's what she has 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.070
 fascinated that she wanted to be helicopter pilots from that moment on 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.130
 Medical studies she hung up short determined 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.730
 Not only did Burton see one of a handful of women using a helicopter 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.900
 flying for three weeks, she is probably the only pilot in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
 Germany which does not have a flight instructor license 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.390
 Adriana long called 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.350
 Helicopter pilots 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 her workplace the airfield in Egelsbach 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.380
 her latest achievement is the flight instructor license 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.380
 my wife on the stick price increase at many commenting on the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.980
 Cold sweat on the forehead 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 but that's not the case with Homburg 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.350
 if you stand there beside big helicopters waiting for the passengers 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 in groups they give a clue then the AWO is a keynote 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.869
 until then, they were right with me yesterday had a first 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.550
 Flight hour and today it's their turn 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.190
 Of course, that's not true, but people are watching 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.260
 are quite shocked and a natural once did not say and if you are on 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.900
 Ground again is then the tip double instead of first two wins and of which he 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.860
 have stolen and second, a woman robbed 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.130
 Adrian Mannarino had no problems in this male world 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.340
 the colleagues in classrooms and at eye level with her 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.560
 after all, all the pregnancy has to be 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 Dr 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 from the Republic 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.789
 just some of their first flight hours 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.570
 and that is in this weather 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060
 wonderful 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.409
 that is a flying gender differences there 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.400
 The 30-year-old already believes that 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 Raul of bit of sensitive barley is for the cowboys 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.250
 in sports that is considered so think about what we do 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.270
 and I would have to say do not stop struck playing bad stuff 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.419
 So he is very calm 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.549
 Even as a flight instructor, she always has the wheel in her hand and if necessary 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.099
 to be able to intervene 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.239
 Adriana Lima is best at her job that traveling all over Europe 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.159
 can be 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.739
 Sometimes she will be a helicopter from Paris 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.909
 or she transfers everything from Lanzarote to Lisbon 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.949
 she can not plan anything and always has to be flexible 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.709
 sometimes she has to get in helicopters and go within two minutes 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 it's 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 with the pilot's license and the flight instructor just ran 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.919
 great wish came true 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.919
 that does not clear of nine percent 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.890
 the supposedly ill he still has to learn to eat on Polarstern 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:56.889
 research Director 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.259
 there are two more helicopters in the Antarctic and Arctic, and that would be 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.189
 a big dream for me to go there time a very interesting one 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.719
 Aviators take a look the researchers at a schools 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.179
 when they come back after which he returns from his own lane 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.189
 would be something nice next Thomas Ganswindt 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.720
 the grape harvest Moscow Tatyana Anodina 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.099
 you can assume 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.989
 will update
