00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.450
 I do not know why I guess the failures of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.139
 dilemma I will not be able to see it with my clothes 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
 habitual in which you comment is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.670
 that it seems that I go nude good that 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 he will be one you just killed it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.240
 just in society nothing happens if the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.779

 who love 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.010
 cheated on the impossible brake I'm going to 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.420
 throw will tell you why why why 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.510
 yes because there can only be one and 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.879
 I am I understand I really liked 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.540
 a lot when the girls but a 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.660
 little more than now 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 can not go and that's because I fell 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.380
 good because I slipped because I'm in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.900
 ice but now I wanted to attract is a 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.640
 even more existential question than this 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.350
 video that you are watching because it rains 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 people from heaven could do 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 Meatballs could be money but they fall 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.490
 people like hard short challenges without 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.820
 come back in 204 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:10.950
 so so I win an egg and everything 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 well quickly to see that before 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.160
 I'm leaving everything just won the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.790
 starting number I think i make me up 2 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.960
 life is that I want is my good thing what 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.330
 who is commenting, you have to send me 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 your challenges for the 104 that you want 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.230
 to be a man or a protagonist 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.360
 woman I'm not going to put as a base 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.430
 build the house to which we are 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.940
 moving if I have to go little by little 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.700
 getting money with him without you and go 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.920
 reforming the house so you already know 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 you have to be prepare for that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 new action that we are going to live in the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.600
 sims and challenges I know how to marry in less 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.160
 of five days I have a son or kills 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.900
 we wanted but I think that you can not 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.610
 not kill so take a tourist 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.890
 problem not but although in what you 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.980
 happen I'm going to be taking some of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.160
 the decisions that I'm going to see 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.980
 and in that way our challenges go to 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.110
 be to play without the video 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.180
 and this is to give him emotion 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.550
 this map is very complicated of people 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.320
 dies area basically I can not stay 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.950
 with the restless and let them die 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.890
 single 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.050
 anyway I will make a video on 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.300
 Sunday and I will tell you details too 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.920
 so for you to tell me challenges do not 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.510
 I will explain a little better there is now is 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.700
 that basically I do not have almost time 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.440
 to be able to make this video so that 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.610
 you what other impressions what 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 come up on Sunday 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.910
 an egg that skids sees that there is no look 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.910
 a life 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.190
 and because it is flying not by a man 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.489
 that makes you believe in me is not so 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.049
 important as to teleport me 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.209
 although it does not take as much as turning and 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.200
 someone looks look look at you yes you are worth 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.940
 naked 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.989
 what is this that has is clear 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.989
 it was almost deleted 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.280
 throw and I say just bounced I said 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.840
 that it was not a good object it was not the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.460
 determined person I have not yet achieved 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.640
 take down anyone as it may be possible 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.340
 but I do know who won the previous rector 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.440
 You never really look around the edges 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.010
 of the underworld because bounces the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.660

 to leave this video has already been short 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.970
 genetic action did not have much more than 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.320
 comment apart from all the challenges for 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.970
 can bring the same foundations because 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.960
 if not, it could not be a video 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.210
 they simply talk about our dice 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.920

 and the next video topic that we're going 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.360
 to be a little different because only 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.630
