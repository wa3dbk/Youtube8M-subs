00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it is as palatable as it is i've been

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.730 
it is as palatable as it is i've been
doing<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.840> thoughts<00:01:31.109> about<00:01:31.259> how<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.500> take

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
doing your thoughts about how you take

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
doing your thoughts about how you take
the<00:01:31.859> process<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> most<00:01:33.359> important

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the process we think the most important

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.359 
the process we think the most important
thing<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.109> having<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.469> grapes<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:35.070> frozen

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
thing is having the grapes really frozen

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
thing is having the grapes really frozen
because<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> juice<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.479> coming<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
because the juice that's coming out is

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.959 
because the juice that's coming out is
as<00:01:37.289> Tom<00:01:37.530> said<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.219> high<00:01:38.430> brix<00:01:38.729> it's

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
as Tom said very very high brix it's

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.149 
as Tom said very very high brix it's
also<00:01:39.180> hire<00:01:39.539> an<00:01:39.810> asset<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.590> acidity<00:01:40.950> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
also hire an asset so the acidity is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
also hire an asset so the acidity is
very<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.549> concentrated<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
very very concentrated and with all that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480 
very very concentrated and with all that
sweetness<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.799> we're<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.039> to<00:01:44.219> end<00:01:44.369> up

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
sweetness that we're going to end up

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
sweetness that we're going to end up
with<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.820> think<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.090> pretty<00:01:45.390> critical<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
with we think that's pretty critical the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
with we think that's pretty critical the
next<00:01:46.950> step<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.609> really<00:01:48.119> most

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
next step that's the really most

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
next step that's the really most
important<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.070> our<00:01:50.130> wines

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
important one from for all of our wines

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
important one from for all of our wines
is<00:01:50.609> fermentation<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:52.409> ice<00:01:52.560> wine<00:01:52.799> that's

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
is fermentation and with ice wine that's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.219 
is fermentation and with ice wine that's
really<00:01:53.490> problematic<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.420> yeast<00:01:54.899> hates

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
really problematic because yeast hates

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.370 
really problematic because yeast hates
three<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.829> sugar<00:01:56.700> cold<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> alcohol<00:01:57.810> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
three things sugar cold and alcohol so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.660 
three things sugar cold and alcohol so
we<00:01:58.499> start<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.770> two<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.429> we<00:01:59.549> immediately

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we start with two and we immediately

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.940 
we start with two and we immediately
start<00:02:00.329> building<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> third<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.679> we're<00:02:01.920> very

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
start building the third so we're very

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.480 
start building the third so we're very
very<00:02:02.280> careful<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> babysit<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> fermentation

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
very careful to babysit the fermentation

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.039 
very careful to babysit the fermentation
to<00:02:04.579> keep<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> temperatures<00:02:05.390> just<00:02:05.570> right<00:02:05.689> so

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
to keep the temperatures just right so

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.020 
to keep the temperatures just right so
the<00:02:06.140> line<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.560> ferment<00:02:06.829> not<00:02:07.130> too<00:02:07.340> quickly<00:02:07.610> but

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the line can ferment not too quickly but

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.330 
the line can ferment not too quickly but
steadily<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:09.530> that's<00:02:09.739> what<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.160> think

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
steadily because that's what we think

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.160 
steadily because that's what we think
brings<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.940> really<00:02:11.120> really<00:02:11.390> clean<00:02:11.870> fruit

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
brings out the really really clean fruit

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.080 
brings out the really really clean fruit
flavors<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:12.680> were<00:02:12.980> known<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:13.849> just

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
flavors that were known for it's just

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.190 
flavors that were known for it's just
cold<00:02:14.270> enough<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.569> my<00:02:14.750> hands<00:02:15.020> are<00:02:15.140> shaking

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
cold enough that my hands are shaking

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.089 
cold enough that my hands are shaking
you<00:02:15.530> hold<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.420> last<00:02:17.420> look<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:18.099> it's

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
you hold this and last look here it's

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.339 
you hold this and last look here it's
almost<00:02:19.310> viscous<00:02:19.940> isn't<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.330> yes<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:21.110> what

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
almost viscous isn't it yes it is what

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.380 
almost viscous isn't it yes it is what
how<00:02:21.650> many<00:02:21.800> bricks<00:02:22.069> would<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.120> above

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
how many bricks would it this is above

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.720 
how many bricks would it this is above
um<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.349> forty<00:02:24.680> point<00:02:24.950> six<00:02:25.010> right<00:02:25.519> now

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
um this is forty point six right now

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.729 
um this is forty point six right now
when<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.120> started<00:02:26.510> pressing<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:27.080> was<00:02:27.319> right

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
when we started pressing it was right

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.410 
when we started pressing it was right
around<00:02:27.860> 48<00:02:28.400> bricks<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.690> delicious
