00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.930 

I<00:00:05.920> began<00:00:06.820> riding<00:00:07.720> and<00:00:08.110> racing<00:00:08.370> motorcycles<00:00:09.370> in

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
I began riding and racing motorcycles in

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.190 
I began riding and racing motorcycles in
the<00:00:10.120> early<00:00:10.389> 70s<00:00:11.020> and<00:00:11.430> at<00:00:12.430> that<00:00:12.460> point<00:00:12.820> in<00:00:12.969> time

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the early 70s and at that point in time

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170 
the early 70s and at that point in time
the<00:00:14.200> suspension<00:00:15.039> the<00:00:15.219> shock<00:00:15.459> absorbers<00:00:16.000> the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
the suspension the shock absorbers the

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.210 
the suspension the shock absorbers the
forks<00:00:16.480> also<00:00:16.930> weren't<00:00:17.590> really<00:00:17.710> up<00:00:17.920> to<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.190> task

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
forks also weren't really up to the task

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.760 
forks also weren't really up to the task
and<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:18.970> thought<00:00:19.270> I<00:00:19.630> can<00:00:19.930> design<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.260> better<00:00:20.500> one

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
and I thought I can design a better one

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.870 
and I thought I can design a better one
so<00:00:21.070> that's<00:00:21.880> what<00:00:22.030> I<00:00:22.060> did<00:00:23.520> we<00:00:24.520> consider

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
so that's what I did we consider

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.420 
so that's what I did we consider
ourselves<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.300> vehicle<00:00:25.630> dynamics<00:00:26.200> company<00:00:26.650> not

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
ourselves a vehicle dynamics company not

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.270 
ourselves a vehicle dynamics company not
just<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.700> shock<00:00:27.940> absorber<00:00:27.970> design<00:00:28.660> company<00:00:29.280> if

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
just a shock absorber design company if

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.950 
just a shock absorber design company if
an<00:00:30.430> engineer's<00:00:30.850> on<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.030> manufacturing<00:00:31.690> floor
