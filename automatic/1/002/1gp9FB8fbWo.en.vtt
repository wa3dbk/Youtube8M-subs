probably all in one video I probably

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.259 
probably all in one video I probably
separate<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.160> those<00:04:00.310> two<00:04:00.489> parts<00:04:00.790> because<00:04:01.090> it's

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
separate in those two parts because it's

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.729 
separate in those two parts because it's
becoming<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:01.780> hiccup<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.170> video<00:04:02.410> remember

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
becoming one hiccup a video remember

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.250 
becoming one hiccup a video remember
that<00:04:02.980> -<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.280> gonna<00:04:03.370> be<00:04:03.519> like<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:04.170> don't<00:04:05.170> know
