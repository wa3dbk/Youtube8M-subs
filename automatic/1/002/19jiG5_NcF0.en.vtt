00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.900 
I think that's an error on every package
because<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> saw<00:02:16.170> three<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.220> these<00:02:17.400> figures<00:02:17.640> in

on morale ex-parte I'm not a huge fan of
this<00:04:24.979> mainly<00:04:25.979> because<00:04:26.189> II<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.259> was<00:04:28.439> a

this mainly because II if this was a
hard<00:04:28.710> plastic<00:04:28.919> you've<00:04:29.370> probably<00:04:29.580> able<00:04:29.849> to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
hard plastic you've probably able to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.550 
hard plastic you've probably able to
spin<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.419> head<00:04:30.569> at<00:04:30.780> least<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.080> little<00:04:31.169> bit<00:04:31.409> and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
spin the head at least a little bit and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.740 
spin the head at least a little bit and
have<00:04:31.710> him<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.919> know<00:04:32.039> looking<00:04:32.689> from<00:04:33.689> a

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
have him you know looking from a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.950 
have him you know looking from a
different<00:04:33.930> angle<00:04:34.400> which<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.810> always<00:04:36.810> like<00:04:36.930> to

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
different angle which I always like to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.240 
different angle which I always like to
do<00:04:37.110> with<00:04:37.229> my<00:04:37.289> figures<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.860> know<00:04:37.919> have<00:04:38.129> them

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
do with my figures you know have them

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.279 
do with my figures you know have them
look<00:04:38.400> for<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.610> different<00:04:38.729> angle<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.360> here<00:04:40.080> it's

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
look for a different angle but here it's

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.990 
look for a different angle but here it's
permanently<00:04:40.770> attached<00:04:41.129> because<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.759> foam

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
permanently attached because of the foam

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.839 
permanently attached because of the foam
it's<00:04:42.379> flexible<00:04:43.379> and<00:04:43.650> some<00:04:44.189> of<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.400> paint<00:04:44.669> is

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
it's flexible and some of the paint is

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.580 
it's flexible and some of the paint is
actually<00:04:45.300> wearing<00:04:45.509> off<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:45.990> fangs<00:04:46.259> as<00:04:46.560> a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
actually wearing off on the fangs as a

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.589 
actually wearing off on the fangs as a
spot<00:04:46.889> they're<00:04:47.129> missing<00:04:47.520> some<00:04:47.819> of<00:04:47.849> the<00:04:48.060> light

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
spot they're missing some of the light

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.959 
spot they're missing some of the light
blue<00:04:48.870> on<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.169> eyes<00:04:49.319> is<00:04:49.620> wearing<00:04:49.919> off<00:04:50.069> so<00:04:50.430> I'm

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
blue on the eyes is wearing off so I'm

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.180 
blue on the eyes is wearing off so I'm
not<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.389> huge<00:04:51.690> fan<00:04:51.719> of<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.259> foam<00:04:52.500> thing<00:04:52.889> just

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
not a huge fan of the foam thing just

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.100 
not a huge fan of the foam thing just
because<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.669> how<00:04:53.819> it<00:04:53.940> affects<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.449> paint<00:04:54.750> and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
because of how it affects the paint and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.790 
because of how it affects the paint and
just<00:04:56.240> how<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.509> hinders<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.990> articulation<00:04:58.650> but

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
just how it hinders the articulation but

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.990 
just how it hinders the articulation but
otherwise<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.460> figure<00:04:59.759> is<00:04:59.819> very

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
otherwise the figure is very

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.050 
otherwise the figure is very
nice-looking<00:05:00.240> can<00:05:00.810> see<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.110> black<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:01.770> red

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
nice-looking can see the black and red

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.659 
nice-looking can see the black and red
the<00:05:03.060> talent<00:05:03.539> hands<00:05:04.139> all<00:05:04.379> the<00:05:04.440> tentacles<00:05:05.280> just

looks really really nice and like he's
one<00:05:09.330> of<00:05:09.449> those<00:05:09.569> unique<00:05:09.840> figures<00:05:10.199> where<00:05:10.349> he

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
one of those unique figures where he

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.830 
one of those unique figures where he
looks<00:05:10.590> different<00:05:10.800> from<00:05:11.190> every<00:05:11.849> angle<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.690> get

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840

the talent seat there he is just an
awesome<00:05:15.659> looking<00:05:16.259> figure<00:05:16.639> probably<00:05:17.639> one<00:05:17.789> of

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
awesome looking figure probably one of

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.019 
awesome looking figure probably one of
the<00:05:18.060> best<00:05:18.300> carnage<00:05:18.779> figures<00:05:19.139> to<00:05:19.409> date<00:05:20.029> just

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029

really really really nice so what's good
understanding<00:05:26.849> again<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:31.349> center<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:31.740> the

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
understanding again the center of the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.869 
understanding again the center of the
shot<00:05:32.099> let's<00:05:32.400> fix<00:05:33.300> that<00:05:33.889> come<00:05:34.889> on<00:05:35.509> alright<00:05:36.509> so

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
shot let's fix that come on alright so

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.219 
shot let's fix that come on alright so
now<00:05:38.879> let's<00:05:38.909> do<00:05:39.210> some<00:05:39.360> articulation<00:05:39.990> for<00:05:40.139> the

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
now let's do some articulation for the

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.409 
now let's do some articulation for the
sky<00:05:40.440> like<00:05:41.129> I<00:05:41.250> said<00:05:41.430> he<00:05:41.490> has<00:05:41.610> no<00:05:41.789> articulation

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
sky like I said he has no articulation

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.390 
sky like I said he has no articulation
in<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.599> head<00:05:42.779> his<00:05:43.409> arms<00:05:43.949> go<00:05:44.339> up<00:05:45.409> down<00:05:46.409> we<00:05:47.250> can

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
in the head his arms go up down we can

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.769 
in the head his arms go up down we can
do<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.580> full<00:05:48.000> 360<00:05:49.219> at<00:05:50.219> the<00:05:50.550> elbow<00:05:51.210> he<00:05:51.539> has<00:05:51.629> an

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
do a full 360 at the elbow he has an

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.619 
do a full 360 at the elbow he has an
elbow<00:05:51.990> joint<00:05:52.080> no<00:05:53.039> spinning<00:05:53.550> just<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:54.089> full

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
elbow joint no spinning just the full

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.290 
elbow joint no spinning just the full
joint<00:05:54.779> that<00:05:54.900> goes<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.199> here<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.680> down<00:05:56.120> he<00:05:57.120> can

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
joint that goes to here and down he can

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.219 
joint that goes to here and down he can
spin<00:05:57.750> all<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.139> way<00:05:58.169> around<00:05:58.289> at<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.650> hand<00:05:58.889> and

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
spin all the way around at the hand and

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.659 
spin all the way around at the hand and
some<00:06:01.229> articulation<00:06:01.529> that<00:06:01.979> makes<00:06:02.219> it<00:06:02.339> go<00:06:02.460> up

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
some articulation that makes it go up

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.879 
some articulation that makes it go up
and<00:06:03.060> out<00:06:03.589> kind<00:06:04.589> of<00:06:04.620> weirdly<00:06:05.370> articulated<00:06:06.150> but

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
and out kind of weirdly articulated but

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.930 
and out kind of weirdly articulated but
articulation<00:06:07.889> on<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.129> same<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:08.669> it's<00:06:08.849> the

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
articulation on the same and it's the

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.749 
articulation on the same and it's the
same<00:06:09.120> for<00:06:09.150> both<00:06:09.300> arms<00:06:09.719> he<00:06:10.650> spins<00:06:11.159> at<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.490> waist

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
same for both arms he spins at the waist

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.320 
same for both arms he spins at the waist
all<00:06:12.089> the<00:06:12.150> way<00:06:12.449> around<00:06:12.900> and<00:06:13.580> at<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.669> legs<00:06:14.940> we

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
all the way around and at the legs we

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.820 
all the way around and at the legs we
can<00:06:15.479> go<00:06:15.629> out<00:06:15.839> back<00:06:17.449> bend<00:06:18.449> at<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.569> knee<00:06:18.830> and

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
can go out back bend at the knee and

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.490 
can go out back bend at the knee and
we've<00:06:20.039> got<00:06:20.159> an<00:06:20.279> ankle<00:06:20.819> joint<00:06:21.180> that<00:06:21.750> is<00:06:22.080> also

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
we've got an ankle joint that is also

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.120 
we've got an ankle joint that is also
strangely<00:06:23.190> articulated<00:06:24.080> but<00:06:25.080> is<00:06:25.349> articulated

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
strangely articulated but is articulated

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.370 
strangely articulated but is articulated
nonetheless<00:06:26.310> so<00:06:26.789> I<00:06:26.819> can't<00:06:27.240> complain

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
nonetheless so I can't complain

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.550 
nonetheless so I can't complain
so<00:06:29.160> let's<00:06:29.400> get<00:06:29.910> max<00:06:30.450> standing<00:06:30.990> if<00:06:31.110> we<00:06:31.290> can

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
so let's get max standing if we can

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.270 
so let's get max standing if we can
because<00:06:32.010> you<00:06:33.260> put<00:06:34.260> going<00:06:34.530> back<00:06:34.770> in<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.040> shot

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
because you put going back in the shot

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.820 
because you put going back in the shot
to<00:06:35.490> make<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.670> look<00:06:36.000> all<00:06:36.180> I'm<00:06:37.020> innocent<00:06:37.500> scary

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
to make it look all I'm innocent scary

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.490 
to make it look all I'm innocent scary
so<00:06:38.900> that's<00:06:39.900> what<00:06:40.050> we've<00:06:40.170> got<00:06:40.350> for

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
so that's what we've got for

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500 
so that's what we've got for
articulation<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:41.340> detail<00:06:41.640> on<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:42.150> carnage

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
articulation and detail on the carnage

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.160 
articulation and detail on the carnage
figure<00:06:46.130> he's<00:06:47.130> a<00:06:47.160> nice<00:06:47.460> figure<00:06:48.000> my<00:06:48.870> main

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
figure he's a nice figure my main

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.140 
figure he's a nice figure my main
problem<00:06:49.500> with<00:06:49.830> him<00:06:49.980> is<00:06:50.340> the<00:06:50.610> foam<00:06:50.850> head

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
problem with him is the foam head

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.210 
problem with him is the foam head
because<00:06:51.720> like<00:06:52.170> I<00:06:52.290> said<00:06:52.500> of<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:52.680> paint<00:06:52.950> wear

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
because like I said of the paint wear

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.430 
because like I said of the paint wear
and<00:06:53.580> just<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:54.120> limited<00:06:54.600> pose<00:06:54.780> ability<00:06:55.200> of<00:06:55.290> the
