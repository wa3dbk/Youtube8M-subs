00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
high-pressure tion is coming and I

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.730 
high-pressure tion is coming and I
thought<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.030> good<00:00:03.540> time<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:04.110> learn<00:00:04.319> how<00:00:04.710> to

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
thought of you good time to learn how to

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.280 
thought of you good time to learn how to
make<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.580> brown<00:00:05.819> traditional<00:00:06.629> round<00:00:06.870> challah

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
for the holiday many different cultures

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.290 
for the holiday many different cultures
have<00:00:10.710> interpreted<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.460> different<00:00:11.490> ways<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
have interpreted in different ways and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.850 
have interpreted in different ways and
so<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> thought<00:00:12.870> I'd<00:00:13.049> show<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.380> three

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
different ways that you can make your

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.580 
different ways that you can make your
follow<00:00:16.560> special<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> holidays<00:00:18.590> right

over<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.250> I've<00:00:20.850> got<00:00:21.210> my<00:00:21.510> dough<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.800> lot<00:00:23.039> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
over here I've got my dough and a lot of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519 
over here I've got my dough and a lot of
times<00:00:23.400> people<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.970> roll<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.289> roll

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
times people just roll it out and roll

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.880 
times people just roll it out and roll
it<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.920> into<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.369> tight<00:00:27.119> ball<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.500> take

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it up into a tight ball but I just take

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.609 
it up into a tight ball but I just take
it<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.480> squeeze<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it and squeeze it first and then you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.750 
it and squeeze it first and then you
look<00:00:32.099> gravity<00:00:32.730> work<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:34.760> actually

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
look gravity work with you to actually

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
look gravity work with you to actually
extend<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.870> doesn't<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.739> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
extend it it doesn't have to be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.869 
extend it it doesn't have to be
perfectly<00:00:38.399> smooth<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.610> work<00:00:41.610> out

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
perfectly smooth and it will work out

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.660 
perfectly smooth and it will work out
just<00:00:41.910> fine<00:00:42.450> only<00:00:43.290> thing<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.680> need<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
just fine only thing you need to do is

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
just fine only thing you need to do is
decide<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.539> n<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.140> want<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> top

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
decide which n if you want to be the top

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
decide which n if you want to be the top
of<00:00:47.309> your<00:00:47.640> crown<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of your crown so this is going to be the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
of your crown so this is going to be the
top<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.250> crown<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.969> pulling<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> over

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
top of my crown and I'm pulling it over

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
top of my crown and I'm pulling it over
to<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.140> perfectly<00:00:52.739> smooth<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.910> I'm

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to make it perfectly smooth then I'm

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.080 
to make it perfectly smooth then I'm
right-handed<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.949> hold<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
right-handed so I'm going to hold the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.680 
right-handed so I'm going to hold the
dough<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.649> smooth<00:00:59.010> part<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.789> left<00:01:00.030> hand

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
dough the smooth part in my left hand

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
dough the smooth part in my left hand
and<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.739> am<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> extend<00:01:04.580> lift<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and I am going to extend lift up the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.140 
and I am going to extend lift up the
dessert<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> center<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
dessert the center just a little and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.539 
dessert the center just a little and
then<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.260> turn<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.310> dough

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
then I'm just going to turn the dough

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
then I'm just going to turn the dough
around<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.600> hand<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:14.150> push<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.540> end<00:01:15.840> o

Pat squeeze it in

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.020 
Pat squeeze it in
so<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.900> tucked<00:01:19.290> under<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> pinched<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so it's tucked under and pinched so it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.980 
so it's tucked under and pinched so it
won't<00:01:21.270> open<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.540> bake<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
won't open up when you bake it and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
won't open up when you bake it and
that's<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that's all there is to it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.969 
that's all there is to it
just<00:01:27.210> remember<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> hold<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.290> end<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
just remember to hold one end up and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.670 
just remember to hold one end up and
then<00:01:29.460> twirl<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> around<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.650> way

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
then twirl it around now this is one way

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.109 
then twirl it around now this is one way
of<00:01:32.070> doing<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.490> another<00:01:33.420> way<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:35.159> make<00:01:35.700> four

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
of doing it another way is to make four

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
of doing it another way is to make four
strands<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> dough<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.170> I've<00:01:37.320> made<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:38.220> made

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
strands of dough and I've made I've made

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
strands of dough and I've made I've made
three<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.659> show<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> the

three and I'm going to show you the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.889 
three and I'm going to show you the
fourth<00:01:40.350> again<00:01:40.799> letting<00:01:41.700> gravity<00:01:42.420> work<00:01:42.630> with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
fourth again letting gravity work with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.969 
fourth again letting gravity work with
you<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.880> dough<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.390> yellow<00:01:45.960> by<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> way

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

coloring in to make it look like a very
rich<00:01:51.810> dough<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.520> particular

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
rich dough but in also this particular

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.709 
rich dough but in also this particular
one<00:01:54.600> I've<00:01:55.560> made<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.270> orange
