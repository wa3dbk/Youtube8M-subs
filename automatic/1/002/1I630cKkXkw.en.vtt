00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.690 

so<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.140> while<00:00:01.469> back<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.890> was<00:00:01.920> working<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> game

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so a while back I was working on a game

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.579 
so a while back I was working on a game
but<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.540> never<00:00:03.689> really<00:00:03.899> got<00:00:03.990> finished<00:00:04.259> with<00:00:04.380> it

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
but I never really got finished with it

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.490 
but I never really got finished with it
so<00:00:05.330> when<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.390> came<00:00:06.540> back<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.930> recently<00:00:07.290> I

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
so when I came back to it recently I

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.320 
so when I came back to it recently I
decided<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.099> make<00:00:08.280> more<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.610> an<00:00:08.730> engine<00:00:09.150> that

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
decided to make more of an engine that

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.290 
decided to make more of an engine that
way<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.380> could<00:00:11.070> make<00:00:11.190> more<00:00:11.490> than<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> original

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
way I could make more than the original

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.999 
way I could make more than the original
game<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.540> wanted<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.840> make<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.530> make<00:00:13.679> any

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
game I wanted to make I can make any

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.420 
game I wanted to make I can make any
game<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.330> running<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> script<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.619> so

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
game just by running a script for it so

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.470 
game just by running a script for it so
here's<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.480> engine<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
here's the engine as of now so here is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.460 
here's the engine as of now so here is
an<00:00:24.660> example<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> engine<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> model<00:00:26.640> odor

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
an example of the engine as a model odor

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.109 
an example of the engine as a model odor
here<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.619> three<00:00:28.800> models<00:00:28.980> i<00:00:29.400> downloaded<00:00:29.789> from

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
here are three models i downloaded from

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.900 
here are three models i downloaded from
google<00:00:30.810> sketchup<00:00:30.990> warehouse<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.399> first<00:00:32.759> one

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
google sketchup warehouse this first one

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.580 
google sketchup warehouse this first one
it's<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> Golden<00:00:33.420> Gate<00:00:33.600> Bridge<00:00:33.630> has<00:00:34.350> about

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it's a Golden Gate Bridge has about

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's a Golden Gate Bridge has about
15,000<00:00:35.370> polygons<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:38.100> getting<00:00:38.340> about

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
15,000 polygons and I'm getting about

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.410 
15,000 polygons and I'm getting about
60fps<00:00:39.180> yeah<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.280> vsync<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.180> yeah<00:00:44.420> here

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
60fps yeah it's that vsync so yeah here

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.680 
60fps yeah it's that vsync so yeah here
is<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.930> next<00:00:46.170> model<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:47.660> New<00:00:48.660> York

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
is the next model it's a New York

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.439 
is the next model it's a New York
railway<00:00:49.469> station<00:00:49.829> awesome<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.210> Google

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
railway station awesome also from Google

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.319 
railway station awesome also from Google
Sketchup<00:00:51.629> warehouse<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.520> only<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:53.760> 4000

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
Sketchup warehouse but only about 4000

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.020 
Sketchup warehouse but only about 4000
polygons<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.550> but<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> thought<00:00:56.879> I'd

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
polygons in this one but I thought I'd

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
polygons in this one but I thought I'd
go<00:00:57.090> ahead<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.239> show<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:59.370> nice<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.949> final

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
go ahead and show it it's nice and final

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.359 
go ahead and show it it's nice and final
is<00:01:04.339> da<00:01:05.390> looking<00:01:06.390> thing<00:01:06.950> this<00:01:07.950> one's<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
is da looking thing this one's the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.990 
is da looking thing this one's the
biggest<00:01:08.790> Maya<00:01:09.720> polygons<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
biggest Maya polygons because all the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
biggest Maya polygons because all the
circles<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> spheres<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.290> round

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
circles are all the spheres and round

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
circles are all the spheres and round
surfaces<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.540> 150<00:01:16.049> thousand

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
surfaces it's about 150 thousand

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.700 
surfaces it's about 150 thousand
polygons<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.909> still<00:01:18.150> getting<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:18.900> 60

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
polygons and I'm still getting over 60

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.789 
polygons and I'm still getting over 60
FPS<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.909> other<00:01:24.060> things<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.650> set

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
FPS so two other things that I have set

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
FPS so two other things that I have set
up<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:27.979> light<00:01:28.979> neuron<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
up right now are a light neuron now if I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.679 
up right now are a light neuron now if I
click<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:32.270> polygon<00:01:33.270> lighting

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
click and that's not polygon lighting

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.899 
click and that's not polygon lighting
that's<00:01:33.840> fragment<00:01:34.350> shader<00:01:34.500> lighting<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that's fragment shader lighting so it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.670 
that's fragment shader lighting so it
looks<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> lot<00:01:36.180> nicer<00:01:38.329> for<00:01:39.329> things<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
looks a lot nicer for things like the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
looks a lot nicer for things like the
real<00:01:43.680> railway<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> entire<00:01:45.630> polygon

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
real railway so the entire polygon

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.389 
real railway so the entire polygon
doesn't<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.439> lit<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.130> part<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
doesn't get lit up it's just the part of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.170 
doesn't get lit up it's just the part of
that<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.680> probably<00:01:49.680> make<00:01:49.920> sense<00:01:51.259> and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
that you want to probably make sense and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
that you want to probably make sense and
finally<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.420> audio<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.430> Oh<00:01:56.640> play

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
finally I have audio so first Oh play

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.679 
finally I have audio so first Oh play
some<00:01:57.210> music

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
some music

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
some music
and<00:02:00.360> like

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and like

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.760 
and like
the<00:02:03.210> changes

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.530 

channel<00:02:06.770> or<00:02:07.070> cheetahs<00:02:07.460> ear<00:02:07.760> depending<00:02:08.300> where

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
channel or cheetahs ear depending where

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:16.720 
channel or cheetahs ear depending where
I<00:02:08.869> am

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.000 

so<00:02:17.730> now<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> show<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.140> actual<00:02:19.500> script

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
so now I show you the actual script

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.690 
so now I show you the actual script
behind<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.650> behind<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.010> ready<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.489> show<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
behind the behind you ready to show you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.009 
behind the behind you ready to show you
the<00:02:23.970> model<00:02:24.599> order<00:02:25.879> so<00:02:26.879> here<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.780> script

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the model order so here is the script

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.830 
the model order so here is the script
it's<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.379> Lua<00:02:28.560> script<00:02:29.510> which<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.690> can

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
it's just a Lua script which you can

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.470 
it's just a Lua script which you can
drag<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.290> drop<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:31.950> exe<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.790> launch<00:02:33.269> it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
drag and drop on to the exe to launch it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.970 
drag and drop on to the exe to launch it
so<00:02:33.739> it's<00:02:34.739> very<00:02:34.860> easy<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.280> create<00:02:35.760> your<00:02:35.970> own

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
so it's very easy to create your own

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.440 
so it's very easy to create your own
scripts<00:02:37.980> slash<00:02:38.459> game<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:40.819> it's<00:02:41.819> very<00:02:42.239> simple

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
scripts slash game and it's very simple

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.259 
scripts slash game and it's very simple
-<00:02:43.010> for<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.129> way<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.370> could<00:02:44.549> like<00:02:44.760> orient

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
model format that I made there

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.599 
model format that I made there
specifically<00:03:26.190> purposed<00:03:26.609> for<00:03:26.880> loading<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.049> a

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
specifically purposed for loading in a

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.360 
specifically purposed for loading in a
vertex<00:03:29.630> buffer<00:03:30.630> object<00:03:31.049> or<00:03:31.500> index<00:03:31.980> vertex

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
vertex buffer object or index vertex

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.909 
vertex buffer object or index vertex
about<00:03:32.549> buffer<00:03:32.940> object<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:34.410> their<00:03:34.530> binary

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
about buffer object in their binary

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.670 
about buffer object in their binary
format<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.720> they're<00:03:36.900> very<00:03:37.109> fast<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.500> load

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
format so they're very fast to load

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.330 
format so they're very fast to load
instead<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.720> OBJ's<00:03:39.720> which<00:03:40.049> is<00:03:40.829> completions<00:03:41.280> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
instead of OBJ's which is completions to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.520 
instead of OBJ's which is completions to
converted<00:03:41.700> from<00:03:41.849> which<00:03:42.079> are<00:03:43.079> nice<00:03:43.260> because

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
converted from which are nice because

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.629 
converted from which are nice because
they're<00:03:43.709> easy<00:03:43.889> to<00:03:44.040> read<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.459> take<00:03:44.609> a

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
they're easy to read but they take a

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.580 
they're easy to read but they take a
long<00:03:44.699> time<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:45.090> load<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:48.510> yeah

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
long time to load so yeah

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.990 
long time to load so yeah
and<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.310> saw<00:03:50.459> here<00:03:50.639> I'd<00:03:51.410> just<00:03:52.819> opens<00:03:53.819> up<00:03:53.910> like

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
and you saw here I'd just opens up like

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.059 
and you saw here I'd just opens up like
this<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.019> actual<00:03:58.199> mother<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:58.560> my<00:03:58.650> machete

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
this so the actual mother for my machete

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.879 
this so the actual mother for my machete
example<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.030> helix<00:04:00.449> it's<00:04:01.379> just<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.620> google

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
example is a helix it's just a google

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.080 
example is a helix it's just a google
sketchup<00:04:02.010> files<00:04:02.400> what<00:04:02.609> I'm<00:04:02.699> getting<00:04:02.910> for

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
sketchup files what I'm getting for

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.140 
sketchup files what I'm getting for
Marla<00:04:03.750> editor<00:04:04.169> right<00:04:04.349> now<00:04:04.500> because<00:04:04.949> it's<00:04:05.150> easy

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
Marla editor right now because it's easy

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.289 
Marla editor right now because it's easy
so<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.079> is<00:04:07.230> one<00:04:07.919> that<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.129> made<00:04:08.220> myself<00:04:10.040> and

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
so this is one that I made myself and

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.140 
so this is one that I made myself and
you<00:04:12.299> can<00:04:12.419> just<00:04:12.629> export<00:04:13.019> as<00:04:13.230> obj<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:15.030> you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
you can just export as obj like you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.009 
you can just export as obj like you
would<00:04:15.269> for<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> surrogate<00:04:16.109> model<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.930> has

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
would for a surrogate model and it has

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.020 
would for a surrogate model and it has
to<00:04:19.139> be<00:04:19.260> yet<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.590> export<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.010> with<00:04:20.039> triangles

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
to be yet you export it with triangles

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.730 
to be yet you export it with triangles
or<00:04:21.750> all<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.320> only<00:04:22.560> triangles<00:04:24.409> here<00:04:25.409> little

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
or all the only triangles here little

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.370 
or all the only triangles here little
files<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.669> texture<00:04:27.599> Carrie

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
files the the texture Carrie

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.580 
files the the texture Carrie
one<00:04:28.470> object<00:04:28.800> files<00:04:29.510> only<00:04:30.510> one<00:04:30.720> texture<00:04:30.990> though

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.840 

and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.130> can<00:04:35.280> convert<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.580> really

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
and then you can convert it really

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.300 
and then you can convert it really
easily<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.540> IMF<00:04:37.230> by<00:04:37.710> dragging<00:04:38.250> and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
easily to the IMF by dragging and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.270 
easily to the IMF by dragging and
dropping<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.670> onto<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.030> exe<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:40.220> opens<00:04:41.220> up

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
dropping it onto the exe and opens up

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.890 
dropping it onto the exe and opens up
this<00:04:41.400> console<00:04:41.820> window<00:04:42.090> which<00:04:42.390> I'm<00:04:42.690> going<00:04:42.840> to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
this console window which I'm going to

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.960 
this console window which I'm going to
change<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.410> graphics<00:04:44.130> but<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.790> have

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
change to graphics but I just have

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.370 
change to graphics but I just have
denied<00:04:45.210> yet

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
denied yet

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.580 
denied yet
and<00:04:47.270> it'll<00:04:48.270> ask<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.510> if<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:49.110> convert<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.440> and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
and it'll ask you if I convert it and

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.860 
and it'll ask you if I convert it and
all<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:50.000> converts<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.600> got<00:04:51.720> your

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
all that converts it and you got your

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.060 
all that converts it and you got your
helix<00:04:52.230> by<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.710> math<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.450> can<00:04:54.630> now<00:04:57.890> tell<00:04:58.890> that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
helix by a math and I can now tell that

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.440 
helix by a math and I can now tell that
to<00:04:59.310> load<00:04:59.580> in<00:04:59.730> very<00:05:00.600> easily

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
to load in very easily

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.170 
to load in very easily
helix<00:05:03.450> studying<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.910> let's<00:05:05.910> have<00:05:06.030> the

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
helix studying this and let's have the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.990 
helix studying this and let's have the
default<00:05:06.570> map<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:09.420> that<00:05:09.930> I

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
default map to that so you that I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.230 
default map to that so you that I
changed<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.150> name<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.540> he<00:05:13.050> like<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:17.240> should

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
changed the name of it he like I should

be<00:05:20.010> laggy<00:05:20.250> because<00:05:20.520> I'm<00:05:20.610> using<00:05:20.940> not<00:05:21.690> fraps<00:05:22.080> to

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
be laggy because I'm using not fraps to

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.900 
be laggy because I'm using not fraps to
record<00:05:22.380> this<00:05:22.710> but<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.820> idea<00:05:24.000> there<00:05:24.890> you<00:05:25.890> go

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.940 

that's<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:29.940> model<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.270> just<00:05:30.710> exported<00:05:31.710> from

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
that's the model I just exported from

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:39.530 
that's the model I just exported from
Google<00:05:32.460> Sketchup<00:05:38.120> that's<00:05:39.120> pretty<00:05:39.300> much<00:05:39.360> it

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
Google Sketchup that's pretty much it

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.460 
Google Sketchup that's pretty much it
and<00:05:40.850> for<00:05:41.850> what<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:42.000> have<00:05:42.150> right<00:05:42.270> now<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.810> I'm
