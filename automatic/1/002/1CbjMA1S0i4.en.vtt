00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
but a actual design with the nozzle and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.710 
but a actual design with the nozzle and
everything<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:16.520> mine<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.090> another

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
pumper tanker that I made got a really

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.050 
pumper tanker that I made got a really
nice<00:01:27.020> pump<00:01:27.320> panel<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.740> think<00:01:27.770> on<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.310> right<00:01:28.490> uh<00:01:28.520> I

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
nice pump panel I think on it right uh I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.370 
nice pump panel I think on it right uh I
got<00:01:29.450> I<00:01:29.659> kind<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.530> made<00:01:30.710> myself<00:01:31.960> got<00:01:32.960> some<00:01:32.990> hose

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
got I kind of made myself got some hose

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.340 
got I kind of made myself got some hose
in<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.740> back<00:01:34.000> ladder

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
in the back ladder

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.950 
in the back ladder
some<00:01:36.350> hose<00:01:37.250> reels<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:39.049> in<00:01:39.200> front<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.929> other

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
some hose reels is in front the other

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.490 
some hose reels is in front the other
side<00:01:44.259> just<00:01:45.259> way<00:01:45.590> way<00:01:45.619> back

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
side just way way back

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.680 
side just way way back
raising<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.619> hose<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.360> hanging<00:01:50.360> off<00:01:50.539> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
raising the hose is a hanging off the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.260 
raising the hose is a hanging off the
edges<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.950> when<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.369> firefighters<00:01:52.940> get<00:01:53.149> to

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
edges so when the firefighters get to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.279 
edges so when the firefighters get to
the<00:01:53.360> scene<00:01:53.600> they<00:01:53.720> can<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:53.990> pull<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.259> right

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
the scene they can just pull it right

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.840 
the scene they can just pull it right
off<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.709> truck<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.100> don't<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.490> client

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
off the truck they don't have to client

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.340 
off the truck they don't have to client
they<00:01:55.940> don't<00:01:56.119> have<00:01:56.209> to<00:01:56.299> reach<00:01:56.479> for<00:01:56.509> it<00:01:56.780> so<00:02:02.350> it's

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
they don't have to reach for it so it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.999 
they don't have to reach for it so it's
another<00:02:03.500> pumper<00:02:03.920> tanker<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:05.060> got<00:02:05.299> I'm<00:02:06.259> 300

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
another pumper tanker it's got I'm 300

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.870 
another pumper tanker it's got I'm 300
feet<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.310> hose<00:02:07.789> I<00:02:07.819> mean<00:02:08.209> I'm<00:02:08.750> assuming<00:02:08.929> and

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
feet of hose I mean I'm assuming and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.640 
feet of hose I mean I'm assuming and
this<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.330> one<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.720> mainly<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:12.170> water<00:02:12.410> to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
this is this one so mainly get water to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.740 
this is this one so mainly get water to
the<00:02:12.799> fire<00:02:13.069> when<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.910> need<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:14.420> need<00:02:14.600> it

the fire when you need really need it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.400 
the fire when you need really need it
beside<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:17.060> front<00:02:19.120> either<00:02:20.120> side<00:02:21.579> saw<00:02:23.410> back

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
beside the front either side saw back

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.490 
beside the front either side saw back
more<00:02:25.250> hose<00:02:25.489> it's<00:02:26.150> kind<00:02:26.329> of<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.540> mess<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.320> uh

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
more hose it's kind of a mess but uh

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.479 
more hose it's kind of a mess but uh
do<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.309 

there's<00:02:33.030> another<00:02:33.239> pumper<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:34.489> similar<00:02:35.489> a

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
there's another pumper a similar a

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.330 
there's another pumper a similar a
similar<00:02:37.610> hose<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.030> everything<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:41.040> know

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
similar hose and everything you know

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.530 
similar hose and everything you know
sounds<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.019> would<00:02:43.079> see<00:02:43.319> in<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.439> city

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
sounds like you would see in the city

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.949 
sounds like you would see in the city
the<00:02:45.540> front<00:02:46.939> other<00:02:47.939> side<00:02:50.540> back<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.780> got<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
the front other side back it's got a

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.509 
the front other side back it's got a
hose<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.439> back<00:02:53.629> top<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:59.069> pump<00:02:59.340> for<00:02:59.459> our

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
hose in the back top this pump for our

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.520 
hose in the back top this pump for our
build<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.939> kind<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.480> older<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.230> I'm

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
build it's kind of older and I'm

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.440 
build it's kind of older and I'm
guessing<00:03:01.980> maybe<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.760> looks<00:03:02.939> like<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.299> from

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
guessing maybe it looks like it's from

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
guessing maybe it looks like it's from
the<00:03:03.540> 80s<00:03:04.069> still<00:03:05.069> useful<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.959> pump<00:03:07.200> panel

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the 80s still useful but the pump panel

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:18.020 
the 80s still useful but the pump panel
on<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.769> back<00:03:12.859> back<00:03:16.159> but<00:03:17.159> my<00:03:17.340> standards<00:03:17.790> every

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
on the back back but my standards every

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.670 
on the back back but my standards every
truck<00:03:18.299> should<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.629> a<00:03:18.659> ladder<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.319> basically

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
truck should have a ladder so basically

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.009 
truck should have a ladder so basically
every<00:03:20.579> truck<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.239> going<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.659> ladder

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.750 

there's<00:03:27.560> another<00:03:27.709> area<00:03:28.010> lonely<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.579> one's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
there's another area lonely this one's

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.030 
there's another area lonely this one's
for<00:03:28.969> more<00:03:29.299> rescue<00:03:29.959> missions<00:03:30.379> and<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.829> for

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
for more rescue missions and it is for

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.250 
for more rescue missions and it is for
actually<00:03:31.340> putting<00:03:31.459> out<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.730> fire<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:35.260> get
