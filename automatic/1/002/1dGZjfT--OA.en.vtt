00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.029
 Yes hello to everyone because everyone 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.770
 we are today that we are going to make a dessert 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.130
 very funny and very rich especially 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.260
 for halloween and that consists then in 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.180
 an orange or fresh orange that the 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.460
 let's cut as before and as before 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.410
 the famous pumpkin and we're going to fill in 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.449
 ice cream and jelly and if you want then 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.949
 I tell you a little about the ingredients 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.710
 of this dish 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.080
 we are going to use gelatin that we have 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.960
 cut into squares an orange 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.130
 fresh ice cream that we have also cut 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.280
 the small ones and then a scoop or 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.070
 spoon sorry a knife and a 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.629
 smaller teaspoon and like ice cream 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.629
 it's going to melt, I'm going to put it 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.480
 in the freezer and now I go back and I continue 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.559
 since it leaves aside I'm going to start 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.500
 cut the orange that would be the first 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.840
 step but I'll explain how it is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.610
 a jack o lantern or the famous pumpkin 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.829
 Halloween consisting of two 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.300
 triangles for the eyes a triangle a 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.100
 slightly smaller for the nose and then 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.080
 a toothless mouth that is what we're going 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.790
 to reproduce in our in our 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.590
 orange that we have here 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.820
 on the farm ideally it has to be 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.950
 that does not move us like this and we're going to 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.720
 let's see that there is nothing ugly about this 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.210
 we're going to leave it behind and in front we're going to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.460
 start working with beautiful 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.590
 then let's make the mouth first 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.830
 let's take the measure 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.390
 to start for example here and finish 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.920
 well more or less here then we go to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.010
 make the top of the teeth of 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.010
 above 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.479
 now I 'm going to remove I 'm going to remove the skin 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.840
 so you can see the effect of how 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.840
 it would be 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 the work and the effect that we want 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.409
 get 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.110
 Be careful not to load your teeth 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.670
 nor the one of river in the down is the smile 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.410
 and now let's start making a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.410
 nose that is a triangle 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.530
 now we start with the eyes as more or 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 less than this height 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.709
 and the next thing would be to do the part of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.709
 above 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:48.220
 and the same thing we removed the shadow editor 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.530
 second step then now it would be to catch 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.470
 our spit a teaspoon that is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.350
 we're going to use like this and it would be 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.570
 all part of inside the orange 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.000
 for which I'm going to help one of 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.610
 a little dish and I'll leave the remains 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.940
 there and nothing because then it would be 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.800
 getting the spoon go orange 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.630
 we have finished removing all the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.730
 filling our orange as you can 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 see and now we are going to withdraw the 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.790
 sombrerete aside and let's start 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.440
 fill it with gelatin because we have 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.050
 cut the gelatin into squares like 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.270
 you can see and nothing else that is so good 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.550
 take the gelatine and introduce it inside 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.380
 of the orange if it comes out through the mouth 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.770
 well almost better not because it gives us the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.570
 feeling a bit of 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.180
 Well, that's about the blood of Halloween and 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.180
 then we fill it well 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.879
 and up 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.010
 Y 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.300
 Well, I think that with this we can 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.850
 put the cap that would be like that and here 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.800
 we have our pumpkin with the blood 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.170
 of specially prepared halloween 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.510
 for the children and then for us 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.010
 also that is very good let's go now 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.810
 if you want with the next one I'm going to 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.740
 filled with ice cream but all that was the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.470
 fridge by l 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.270
 I'll fill in a little bit then the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.730
 next with ice cream 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.980
 I return to remove the lid is empty as 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.510
 you see and then nothing we are putting some 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.510
 little balls that we have been creating 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:37.260
 and I put the cap 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.390
 and well, we hope you enjoy it 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.820
 much this dessert and that you enjoy a 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.820
 bloody halloween and very rich
