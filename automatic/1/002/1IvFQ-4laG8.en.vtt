go<00:01:09.270> though<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.040> don't<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.340> heroes<00:01:11.670> could

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
go though I don't think my heroes could

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.499 
go though I don't think my heroes could
deal<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.540> shoes<00:01:13.670> ok<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.360> I'm

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
deal with all them shoes ok so I'm

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.859 
deal with all them shoes ok so I'm
thinking<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.409> probably<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.869> get

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
thinking what I could probably do is get

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
thinking what I could probably do is get
rid<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:19.470> elixir<00:01:20.100> pumps<00:01:20.430> and
