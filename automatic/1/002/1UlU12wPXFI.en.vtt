that<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.629> backed<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> volume<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.730> if<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.879> said

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that I backed the volume up if I said

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
that I backed the volume up if I said
the<00:00:57.360> trick<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:58.530> standing<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.129> front

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the trick is I'm standing right in front

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.029 
the trick is I'm standing right in front
now<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.600> sound<00:01:00.870> coming<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> speaker<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
now the sound coming out the speaker is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
now the sound coming out the speaker is
hitting<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.390> guitar<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
hitting the back of the guitar and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710 
hitting the back of the guitar and
getting<00:01:04.320> body<00:01:04.680> feedback<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:06.030> electronic

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
getting body feedback not electronic

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
getting body feedback not electronic
feedback<00:01:07.460> not<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.640> high-pitched

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
feedback not that high-pitched

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
feedback not that high-pitched
electronic<00:01:09.540> squeal<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> times<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
electronic squeal but a lot of times the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.800 
electronic squeal but a lot of times the
way<00:01:11.400> those<00:01:11.580> bands<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:12.030> getting<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> thing

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
way those bands are getting that thing

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
way those bands are getting that thing
is<00:01:13.140> they're<00:01:13.350> turning<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> volume<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is they're turning the volume up and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.340 
is they're turning the volume up and
they're<00:01:15.030> standing<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> relationship<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
they're standing in relationship with

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
they're standing in relationship with
the<00:01:16.439> speaker<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> back<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> guitar<00:01:18.060> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the speaker so the back of the guitar is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
the speaker so the back of the guitar is
picking<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> sound<00:01:19.740> coming<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
picking up the sound coming out of the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:29.880 
picking up the sound coming out of the
speaker

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.880 

and<00:01:30.890> whatever<00:01:31.100> no<00:01:31.400> idea

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.969 

I<00:01:38.050> started<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:39.200> some<00:01:39.380> electronic

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
I started to get some electronic

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.570 
I started to get some electronic
feedback<00:01:40.400> there<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:40.790> for<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.000> most<00:01:41.120> part

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.080 

oh<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.840> body<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.440> guitar<00:01:45.580> is<00:01:46.580> in<00:01:46.640> front<00:01:46.970> of

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
oh the body of the guitar is in front of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.620 
oh the body of the guitar is in front of
the<00:01:47.180> speaker

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the speaker

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.120 
the speaker
so<00:01:48.110> there's<00:01:48.290> hitting<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.680> back<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
so there's hitting the back of the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:07.340 
so there's hitting the back of the
guitar<00:01:49.360> position<00:01:50.360> yourself<00:01:56.860> compressor

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.770 

no<00:02:07.590> no<00:02:08.190> reverb<00:02:08.550> no<00:02:08.819> compression<00:02:09.240> nothing<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
no no reverb no compression nothing it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.690 
no no reverb no compression nothing it
is<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> tube<00:02:10.170> amplifier<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.100> does<00:02:11.250> compress

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
is a tube amplifier so it does compress

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.490 
is a tube amplifier so it does compress
a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.270> its<00:02:12.480> own<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.200> all<00:02:13.319> I'm

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
a little bit on its own but all I'm

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.190 
a little bit on its own but all I'm
doing<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:14.130> standing<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.209> then<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.930> spend

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
doing is standing and then I can spend

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.650 
doing is standing and then I can spend
the<00:02:16.319> volume<00:02:16.650> knob<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.880> louder<00:02:18.180> or

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
the volume knob here and get louder or

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
the volume knob here and get louder or
you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:18.989> use<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> volume<00:02:19.560> pedal<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> trick

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
you can use a volume pedal but the trick

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.400 
you can use a volume pedal but the trick
is<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:25.670> let<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> body<00:02:26.970> feedback<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.959> solid

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
is to let the body feedback this solid

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.260 
is to let the body feedback this solid
hunk<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.739> wood<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:29.520> get<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> sound<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.209> of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
hunk of wood will get the sound out of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.570 
hunk of wood will get the sound out of
the<00:02:30.390> speaker<00:02:30.810> make<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> strings<00:02:31.560> continue<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the speaker make the strings continue to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.460 
the speaker make the strings continue to
sustain<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.330> ring<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.750> same<00:02:33.959> pitch<00:02:34.260> that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
sustain and ring the same pitch that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.040 
sustain and ring the same pitch that
your<00:02:34.650> pray<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.550> practice<00:02:36.209> has<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.720> where<00:02:36.959> you

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
your pray so practice has and where you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.180 
your pray so practice has and where you
can<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.440> front<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.800> speaker<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
can in front of the speaker the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.830 
can in front of the speaker the
neighbors<00:02:38.580> aren't<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.390> you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
neighbors aren't going to like this you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840 
neighbors aren't going to like this you
got<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.230> loud<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.670> when

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
got to be loud to do this so do it when

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.340 
got to be loud to do this so do it when
nobody<00:02:42.000> else<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.390> around<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.080> stern

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
nobody else is around and get to stern

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.710 
nobody else is around and get to stern
but<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.280> body<00:02:44.519> feedback<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> that's<00:02:45.480> one

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
but that's body feedback and that's one

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.620 
but that's body feedback and that's one
way<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.900> get<00:02:46.140> sustained
