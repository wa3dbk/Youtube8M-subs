00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
interested in that so i suppose that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.850 
interested in that so i suppose that
what<00:03:32.580> we<00:03:32.730> might<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:32.970> as<00:03:33.390> an<00:03:33.570> israeli<00:03:33.860> reprisal

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
what we might see as an israeli reprisal

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.220 
what we might see as an israeli reprisal
which<00:03:35.400> would<00:03:35.640> be<00:03:35.670> sort<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.300> limited<00:03:37.050> and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
which would be sort of limited and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.930 
which would be sort of limited and
contained<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> course<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.760> ball

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
contained and then of course the ball

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.630 
contained and then of course the ball
will<00:03:39.150> be<00:03:39.270> tossed<00:03:39.570> into<00:03:39.920> his<00:03:40.920> balance<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.460> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640

see<00:03:41.790> what<00:03:41.970> their<00:03:42.120> reaction<00:03:42.570> will<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:42.980> Israel

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
see what their reaction will be Israel

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.580 
see what their reaction will be Israel
will<00:03:44.160> not<00:03:44.400> let<00:03:44.670> his<00:03:44.940> valla<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.480> Iran<00:03:45.840> turn<00:03:46.320> both
