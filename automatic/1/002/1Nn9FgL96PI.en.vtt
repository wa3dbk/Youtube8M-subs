a dead guy right
uh<00:01:09.680> yeah<00:01:10.680> essentially<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.430> am<00:01:11.580> playing<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> dead

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
uh yeah essentially I am playing a dead

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
uh yeah essentially I am playing a dead
guy<00:01:14.060> what<00:01:15.060> process<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.840> through<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
guy what process do you go through you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
guy what process do you go through you
know<00:01:16.920> what's<00:01:17.130> what's<00:01:17.400> harder<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
