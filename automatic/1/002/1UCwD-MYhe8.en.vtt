devices which Microsoft you know wanted
to<00:00:20.850> compare<00:00:21.119> against<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> iPad<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.560> surface

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189 
head-to-head with the MacBook Air the
big<00:00:26.849> difference<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> course<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
big difference of course is that the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
big difference of course is that the
surface<00:00:28.470> pro<00:00:28.500> 3<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:29.099> also<00:00:29.340> act<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.390> tablet

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
your tablet the devices are about the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
your tablet the devices are about the
same<00:01:00.930> width<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.559> its<00:01:01.949> thinnest<00:01:02.520> point<00:01:02.760> the

same width at its thinnest point the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.979 
same width at its thinnest point the
MacBook<00:01:03.270> Air<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.420> still<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> little

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
MacBook Air is still gonna be a little

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
MacBook Air is still gonna be a little
bit<00:01:04.170> better<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.070> overall<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.330> surface<00:01:06.750> pro<00:01:06.930> 3

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bit better but overall the surface pro 3

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.039 
bit better but overall the surface pro 3
is<00:01:07.530> only<00:01:08.189> 951<00:01:09.000> millimeters<00:01:09.420> thick<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
is only 951 millimeters thick so it's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.679 
is only 951 millimeters thick so it's
actually<00:01:10.580> thinner<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> original<00:01:12.540> iPad

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
actually thinner than the original iPad

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually thinner than the original iPad
and<00:01:13.260> iPad<00:01:13.830> 2<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> surface<00:01:15.000> pro<00:01:15.210> 3<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and iPad 2 so the surface pro 3 and the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
and iPad 2 so the surface pro 3 and the
macbook<00:01:16.110> air<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.710> about<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> same<00:01:17.670> thickness

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
macbook air are about the same thickness

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
macbook air are about the same thickness
now<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.500> weight<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:20.189> Microsoft

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
now what about weight now Microsoft

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
now what about weight now Microsoft
makes<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.659> big<00:01:21.840> deal<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.080> saying<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
makes a big deal about saying that the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920 
makes a big deal about saying that the
surface<00:01:23.070> pro<00:01:23.280> 3<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.759> lighter<00:01:24.630> than<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
surface pro 3 is lighter than the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.260 
surface pro 3 is lighter than the
MacBook<00:01:25.170> Air<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.860> true<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:27.060> once

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
MacBook Air and it's true it is but once

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
MacBook Air and it's true it is but once
you<00:01:27.390> add<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.200> type<00:01:28.380> cover<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you add in the type cover which if you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
you add in the type cover which if you
want<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.509> sort<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.780> laptop

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
want to use this as any sort of laptop

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
want to use this as any sort of laptop
if<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.670> weight<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
if they don't want to do the weight is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
if they don't want to do the weight is
almost<00:01:33.479> exactly<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> same<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.710> talking

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
almost exactly the same you're talking

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.630 
almost exactly the same you're talking
about<00:01:34.979> maybe<00:01:35.869> 2/10<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> pound<00:01:37.320> lighter<00:01:38.220> here

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
about maybe 2/10 of a pound lighter here

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
about maybe 2/10 of a pound lighter here
versus<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.780> once<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
versus here but once you get to the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.630 
versus here but once you get to the
weight<00:01:40.500> distribution<00:01:40.740> side<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.520> what

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
weight distribution side you know what

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
weight distribution side you know what
they<00:01:41.759> both<00:01:41.970> weigh<00:01:42.299> under<00:01:42.899> three<00:01:43.079> pounds<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
they both weigh under three pounds and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.080 
they both weigh under three pounds and
you're<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.909> able<00:01:44.970> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you're not really going to be able to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
you're not really going to be able to
tell<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> difference<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:45.930> both<00:01:46.049> really

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
tell a difference so they're both really

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
tell a difference so they're both really
light<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.360> as

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
light but this is not going to be as

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200 
light but this is not going to be as
light<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.530> an<00:01:49.649> iPad<00:01:49.920> air<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.030> going

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
light as an iPad air and it's not going

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
light as an iPad air and it's not going
to<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.360> considerably<00:01:52.170> lighter<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.710> noticeably

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to be considerably lighter or noticeably

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.340 
to be considerably lighter or noticeably
lighter<00:01:53.340> than<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> MacBook<00:01:54.420> Air<00:01:54.540> what's<00:01:55.079> really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
lighter than a MacBook Air what's really

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
lighter than a MacBook Air what's really
different<00:01:55.590> about<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.340> surface<00:01:56.579> pro<00:01:56.759> 3<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
different about the surface pro 3 is the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
different about the surface pro 3 is the
screen<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> screen<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.619> actually

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
screen and the screen is actually

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.819 
screen and the screen is actually
different<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> two<00:01:59.909> ways<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:01.259> resolution

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
different in two ways one the resolution

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.440 
different in two ways one the resolution
so<00:02:02.009> this

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
so this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.679 
so this
it<00:02:02.570> has<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.750> 2160<00:02:03.649> by<00:02:03.740> 1440<00:02:04.579> resolution<00:02:04.880> display

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
it has a 2160 by 1440 resolution display

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.179 
it has a 2160 by 1440 resolution display
so<00:02:05.750> that's<00:02:05.990> basically<00:02:06.289> retina<00:02:06.740> quality

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
so that's basically retina quality

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.389 
so that's basically retina quality
display<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.179> MacBook<00:02:08.569> Air<00:02:08.599> has<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.369> 1440<00:02:10.369> by

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
display the MacBook Air has a 1440 by

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.970 
display the MacBook Air has a 1440 by
900<00:02:10.640> resolution<00:02:11.450> display<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.260> fine<00:02:12.650> you

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
900 resolution display it's fine you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.619 
900 resolution display it's fine you
know<00:02:13.099> for<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> regular<00:02:13.700> web<00:02:13.910> work<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.480> is

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
know for a regular web work but this is

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.059 
know for a regular web work but this is
not<00:02:14.780> gonna<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.200> not<00:02:15.260> gonna<00:02:15.440> be<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:15.769> good<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.040> a

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
not gonna it's not gonna be as good as a

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.100 
not gonna it's not gonna be as good as a
MacBook<00:02:16.489> Pro<00:02:16.670> Retina<00:02:17.000> or<00:02:17.300> as<00:02:17.690> good<00:02:17.840> as<00:02:17.959> what

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
MacBook Pro Retina or as good as what

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.800 
MacBook Pro Retina or as good as what
you<00:02:18.200> would<00:02:18.290> get<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.530> an<00:02:18.650> iPad<00:02:19.069> or<00:02:19.340> Nexus<00:02:19.849> 7<00:02:20.150> so

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you would get on an iPad or Nexus 7 so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.479 
you would get on an iPad or Nexus 7 so
in<00:02:20.989> addition<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.380> being<00:02:21.590> able<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.860> use<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
in addition to being able to use the

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.580 
in addition to being able to use the
high<00:02:22.610> resolution<00:02:23.120> display<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> keyboard

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
high resolution display with a keyboard

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.780 
high resolution display with a keyboard
and<00:02:24.680> mouse<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.250> can<00:02:25.370> actually<00:02:25.489> get<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and mouse and you can actually get a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.370 
and mouse and you can actually get a
docking<00:02:26.090> station<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.569> this<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.230> also

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
docking station with this you can also

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.589 
docking station with this you can also
use<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.549> interact<00:02:28.970> with<00:02:29.030> touch<00:02:29.269> devices

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
use this to interact with touch devices

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.990 
use this to interact with touch devices
one<00:02:30.260> thing<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.739> note<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.519> because

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
one thing I will note is that because

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.839 
one thing I will note is that because
the<00:02:32.599> screen<00:02:32.959> basically<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.769> computer<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
the screen basically is the computer the

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.940 
the screen basically is the computer the
white<00:02:35.090> balance<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.810> little<00:02:35.959> bit<00:02:36.319> off<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.890> to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
white balance is a little bit off so to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.280 
white balance is a little bit off so to
try<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.310> compensate<00:02:37.610> for<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.209> Microsoft<00:02:39.170> has

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
try to compensate for that Microsoft has

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.680 
try to compensate for that Microsoft has
put<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.920> kickstand<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.060> back<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
put in a kickstand on the back of the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.680 
put in a kickstand on the back of the
surface<00:02:41.989> pro<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.549> what<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:44.269> can<00:02:44.390> use

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
surface pro and this is what you can use

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.039 
surface pro and this is what you can use
to<00:02:45.130> basically<00:02:46.130> try<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.090> keep<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.510> propped<00:02:47.840> up

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
to basically try to keep this propped up

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.770 
to basically try to keep this propped up
when<00:02:48.200> you're<00:02:48.319> using<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.940> otherwise<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.510> type

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
when you're using it otherwise the type

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.449 
when you're using it otherwise the type
cover<00:02:51.049> would<00:02:51.500> not<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.769> able<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:51.980> support<00:02:52.250> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
cover would not be able to support the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.009 
cover would not be able to support the
weight<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> screen<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.450> not<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:53.750> bad

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
weight of the screen it's not a bad

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.930 
weight of the screen it's not a bad
experience<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.799> only<00:02:55.099> thing<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.610> that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
experience the only thing is that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.759 
experience the only thing is that
because<00:02:56.329> you<00:02:56.480> do<00:02:56.630> have<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.989> rely<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.260> this

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
because you do have to rely on this

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.550 
because you do have to rely on this
kickstand<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:59.480> does<00:02:59.690> feel<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.049> bit<00:03:00.319> less

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
kickstand it does feel a little bit less

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.470 
kickstand it does feel a little bit less
secure<00:03:00.709> if<00:03:01.370> you're<00:03:01.579> in<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> situation<00:03:01.849> where

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
secure if you're in a situation where

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.390 
secure if you're in a situation where
you<00:03:02.780> maybe<00:03:03.049> can't<00:03:03.470> use<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.890> on<00:03:04.069> your<00:03:04.190> lap

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
you maybe can't use this on your lap

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.559 
you maybe can't use this on your lap
that<00:03:04.700> doesn't<00:03:04.970> mean<00:03:05.090> you're<00:03:05.209> out<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.329> luck

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
that doesn't mean you're out of luck

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.789 
that doesn't mean you're out of luck
Microsoft<00:03:06.079> has<00:03:06.170> actually<00:03:06.500> thought<00:03:06.680> of

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
Microsoft has actually thought of

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:07.900 
Microsoft has actually thought of
something<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.100> with<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.430> they<00:03:07.579> actually

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
something and with that they actually

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.479 
something and with that they actually
have<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.299> great<00:03:08.690> stylus<00:03:09.230> pin<00:03:09.530> attachment<00:03:10.190> so

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
have this great stylus pin attachment so

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.970 
have this great stylus pin attachment so
using<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.420> stylus<00:03:11.630> pin<00:03:12.019> you<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.590> use<00:03:12.739> an<00:03:12.829> app

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
using the stylus pin you can use an app

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.819 
using the stylus pin you can use an app
like<00:03:13.310> OneNote<00:03:14.209> or<00:03:14.480> let's<00:03:15.079> say<00:03:15.260> let's<00:03:15.560> say<00:03:15.680> we

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
like OneNote or let's say let's say we

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.289 
like OneNote or let's say let's say we
want<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.010> take<00:03:16.160> some<00:03:16.340> notes<00:03:16.370> by<00:03:16.639> drawing<00:03:16.970> and

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
want to take some notes by drawing and

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.569 
want to take some notes by drawing and
we<00:03:17.870> can<00:03:18.049> draw<00:03:18.350> with<00:03:19.100> our<00:03:19.549> stylus<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:21.579> there

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
we can draw with our stylus and there

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.990 
we can draw with our stylus and there
you<00:03:22.670> go<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:25.250> device<00:03:25.639> and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
you go so we know that this device and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.059 
you go so we know that this device and
this<00:03:26.690> device<00:03:26.750> are<00:03:27.350> fairly<00:03:27.680> similar

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
this device are fairly similar

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.440 
this device are fairly similar
especially<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.910> just<00:03:28.970> want<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.269> use<00:03:29.420> it

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
especially if you just want to use it

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.750 
especially if you just want to use it
like<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> laptop<00:03:30.049> but<00:03:30.920> what<00:03:31.100> Microsoft's<00:03:31.549> real

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
like a laptop but what Microsoft's real

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.750 
like a laptop but what Microsoft's real
argument<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.389> this<00:03:33.139> device<00:03:33.470> can<00:03:33.980> also<00:03:34.130> act<00:03:34.519> as

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
argument is this device can also act as

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.120 
argument is this device can also act as
a<00:03:34.850> replacement<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:35.569> this<00:03:36.200> device<00:03:36.530> this

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
a replacement for this device this

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.940 
a replacement for this device this
device<00:03:37.190> being<00:03:37.880> an<00:03:38.150> iPad<00:03:38.540> air<00:03:38.750> obviously<00:03:39.500> the

device being an iPad air obviously the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.650 
device being an iPad air obviously the
surface<00:03:40.220> pro<00:03:40.370> 3<00:03:40.400> has<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.910> much<00:03:41.120> bigger<00:03:41.299> screen

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
surface pro 3 has a much bigger screen

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.240 
surface pro 3 has a much bigger screen
that's<00:03:42.139> a<00:03:42.200> good<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> bad<00:03:42.620> thing<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.220> a

that's a good and a bad thing it's a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.319 
that's a good and a bad thing it's a
good<00:03:43.400> thing<00:03:43.579> because<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:43.910> have<00:03:44.030> more<00:03:44.180> real

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
good thing because you have more real

that's before we even talk about apps
there's<00:03:57.690> tons<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.019> apps<00:03:58.170> on<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.560> device<00:03:58.830> that

do<00:04:01.590> think<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.280> make<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.519> argument<00:04:02.550> that

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
do think you can make the argument that

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.059 
do think you can make the argument that
this<00:04:03.209> device<00:04:04.190> could<00:04:05.190> replace<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:06.480> device

the focus in the advantage in my opinion

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.670 
the focus in the advantage in my opinion
is<00:04:23.910> not<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:24.780> much<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.050> touchscreen<00:04:25.380> or

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
is not in so much the touchscreen or

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.320 
is not in so much the touchscreen or
even<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.070> pin<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.760> fact<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.090> Microsoft

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
even the pin but the fact that Microsoft

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.640 
even the pin but the fact that Microsoft
has<00:04:27.690> come<00:04:27.840> out<00:04:27.930> with<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.080> really<00:04:28.320> lightweight

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
has come out with a really lightweight

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.730 
has come out with a really lightweight
portable<00:04:29.430> device<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.240> spec<00:04:31.169> wise<00:04:31.320> can<00:04:31.650> go

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740

portable device that spec wise can go
head-to-head<00:04:32.070> against<00:04:32.790> this<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.360> some

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
head-to-head against this and in some

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.460 
head-to-head against this and in some
ways<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:33.780> even<00:04:33.900> better<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:34.889> as<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.669> laptop

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
ways it's even better so as a laptop

ways it's even better so as a laptop
this<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.650> great<00:04:37.889> as<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.250> tablet<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:40.080> know<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.290> I
