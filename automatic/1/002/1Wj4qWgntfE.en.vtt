of organic gardening and basically what

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.649 
of organic gardening and basically what
we're<00:01:23.820> doing<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:25.520> improving<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> soil<00:01:26.880> every

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
we're doing is improving the soil every

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.170 
we're doing is improving the soil every
year<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.320> use<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.770> garden<00:01:29.220> soil<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.700> should

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
year we use our garden soil it should

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
year we use our garden soil it should
get<00:01:30.299> better<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:31.500> depleted<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.759> worn<00:01:33.030> out

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
get better not depleted and not worn out

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.890 
get better not depleted and not worn out
but<00:01:33.689> better<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.890> fluffier<00:01:35.900> darker

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
but better it should be fluffier darker

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
but better it should be fluffier darker
richer<00:01:37.880> more<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.380> more<00:01:40.380> abundant<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.009> small

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
richer more a more abundant in small

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.660 
richer more a more abundant in small
life<00:01:41.820> forms<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.810> fruitful<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.549> we

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
life forms and more fruitful so what we

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
life forms and more fruitful so what we
want<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.299> add<00:01:45.450> compost<00:01:45.990> every<00:01:46.350> year<00:01:46.649> and
