back<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.500> day<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.490> seems<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.120> be<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
back in the day so it seems to be the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.900 
back in the day so it seems to be the
trend<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.320> former<00:02:50.130> number<00:02:50.310> ones<00:02:50.700> of

trend that the former number ones of

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.570 
trend that the former number ones of

former Grand Slam champions back into

experienced and knowledge back to the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.690 
experienced and knowledge back to the
top<00:02:57.930> players<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.320> today<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.130> think<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.490> adds

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
top players of today and I think it adds

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.070 
top players of today and I think it adds
to<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> quality<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.450> tenure<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:00.990> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
to the quality of tenure think the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.800 
to the quality of tenure think the
quality<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.560> altogether<00:03:02.100> better<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.030> think

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
quality is altogether better I think

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.930 
quality is altogether better I think
that<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.470> top<00:03:04.710> is<00:03:04.860> closer<00:03:05.190> there<00:03:05.550> isn't<00:03:05.880> just

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
that the top is closer there isn't just

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.120 
that the top is closer there isn't just
one<00:03:06.210> per<00:03:06.720> hour<00:03:06.870> or<00:03:07.020> two<00:03:07.170> players<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.740> couple<00:03:08.070> of

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
one per hour or two players a couple of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.650 
one per hour or two players a couple of
glands<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.880> chance<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.360> winning

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
glands we have the chance of winning

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.530 
glands we have the chance of winning
Grand<00:03:10.230> Slams<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.910> really<00:03:11.910> being<00:03:12.030> ranked<00:03:12.390> on

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
Grand Slams and really being ranked on

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.450 
Grand Slams and really being ranked on
the<00:03:12.570> world<00:03:12.930> rankings<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.740> I<00:03:14.070> think<00:03:14.310> it's

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
the world rankings and I think it's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.640 
the world rankings and I think it's
because<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.240> this<00:03:15.510> new<00:03:15.810> group<00:03:16.470> of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
because of this this new group of
