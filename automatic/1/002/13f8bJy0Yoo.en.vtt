you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.009> end<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.280> doing<00:01:59.460> things<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you can end up doing things like this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.069 
you can end up doing things like this
inside<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> car<00:02:01.409> which<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.600> end<00:02:03.840> up

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
inside the car which is a you can end up

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
inside the car which is a you can end up
putting<00:02:04.259> cable<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.610> end<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.939> putting<00:02:06.180> all

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
putting cable you can end up putting all

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.059 
putting cable you can end up putting all
kinds<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
kinds of

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.910 
kinds of
when<00:02:09.159> sprays<00:02:09.489> in<00:02:09.819> here<00:02:10.090> which<00:02:10.689> is<00:02:11.049> these<00:02:11.590> are

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
when sprays in here which is these are

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.050 
when sprays in here which is these are
almost<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:12.370> cheese<00:02:13.030> ways<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.900> basically

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
almost like cheese ways so basically

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.000 
almost like cheese ways so basically
we're<00:02:16.060> going<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.269> fill<00:02:16.480> one<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.230> play<00:02:17.769> with

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
we're going to fill one and play with

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.740 
we're going to fill one and play with
one<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.549> see<00:02:18.760> how<00:02:18.790> Bodi<00:02:19.239> likes<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:21.599> Bogey's<00:02:22.599> in

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
one and see how Bodi likes it Bogey's in

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.530 
one and see how Bodi likes it Bogey's in
between<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.590> couple<00:02:24.010> sizes<00:02:24.310> because<00:02:24.700> Modi's<00:02:25.030> 35

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
between a couple sizes because Modi's 35

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.339 
between a couple sizes because Modi's 35
pounds<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.269> medium<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.659> up<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.959> 35

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
pounds so the the medium is up to 35

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.250 
pounds so the the medium is up to 35
pounds<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.799> large<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.220> 30<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.670> 65<00:02:31.090> pounds<00:02:31.599> for

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
pounds the large is 30 to 65 pounds for

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.679 
pounds the large is 30 to 65 pounds for
Bodi<00:02:32.769> we're<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> go<00:02:33.670> ahead<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.090> use<00:02:34.329> the

to do and I want to show you these are
pretty<00:02:53.169> neat<00:02:53.439> because<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:54.579> concrete's<00:02:55.329> are

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
pretty neat because the concrete's are

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.460 
pretty neat because the concrete's are
the<00:02:56.620> same<00:02:57.000> shape<00:02:58.000> as<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.599> actual<00:02:58.870> come<00:02:59.230> and

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the same shape as the actual come and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.559 
the same shape as the actual come and
they're<00:02:59.560> designed<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.099> go<00:03:00.310> inside<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.359> what

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
they're designed to go inside so what

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.909 
they're designed to go inside so what
we're<00:03:01.689> going<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.079> is<00:03:02.349> we're<00:03:02.769> going<00:03:02.799> to

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:08.780 
we're going to do is we're going to
create<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.310> base<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:05.849> we're<00:03:06.849> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.239> put<00:03:07.419> in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
create a base and we're going to put in

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.460 
create a base and we're going to put in
so<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.150> goes<00:03:10.299> like<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.659> you<00:03:10.900> use<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.319> like

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
so it goes like this you use it like

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.300 
so it goes like this you use it like
cheese<00:03:11.709> whiz<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:14.379> squirt<00:03:14.680> some<00:03:14.919> inside

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
cheese whiz and you squirt some inside

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.879 
cheese whiz and you squirt some inside
see<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:17.579> then<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.389> put<00:03:19.889> kibble

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
see that and then you can put kibble

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.479 
see that and then you can put kibble
