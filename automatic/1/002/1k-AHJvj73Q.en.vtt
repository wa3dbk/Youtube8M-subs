00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.750
 hey live and has not been from these stores 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.900
 where they sell all the articles of 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.309
 cleaning as per liters and so almost nothing 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.379
 more is not very presentable is very 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.690
 ecological if you do not see well what you 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.240
 it seems we feel a better good idea 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.470
 good pretty and cheap to drink or much more 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.270
 presentable this is the list of 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 materials 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.800
 for the soap dish you need a bottle of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.410
 contact glass plastic dispenser 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.380
 liquid soap flat acrylic beads 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.790
 a hammer nail gun and bars 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.790
 silicone and spray paint 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.600
 we are ready what a good idea to be 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 more than the part of the jam 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.719
 gifted the cheap gift nothing the idea 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.329
 first is to make a small hole for 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:03.879
 which will put intense dor 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:06.809
 the reading don dale dale and I 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.809
 I have to give another 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.159
 not so much that burn the saint 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 there is perfect 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.149
 a little more from less to beyond me 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.149
 pass no longer 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.610
 because it has to be right there is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.330
 your jump 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.930
 Check how accurate they have been 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.729
 driving and there in with force 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.940
 good once we already asked that he entered 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.820
 well I'm going to take it out a little commented that 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.170
 saving because it was impossible to remove 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 label this jar that well 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.119
 we could leave it transparent and do 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.490
 some design but we can also line 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.560
 I like more draft in or maybe the best 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.180
 pain you like I like more that or this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.610
 It's fine because it's going to be a while house 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.509
 body and its good so how nice are you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.330
 I liked this one 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.640
 and I'm going to have the backward escape 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 check spray 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.840
 as what he is doing designer 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.489
 stepping on the heels in the spray to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.140
 our silicon gun that is what 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.930
 what else we use but still not 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.040
 truth still does not come but there goes 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.099
 the one who perseveres reaches 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.349
 we are reporting if you have 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.439
 liquid to remove labels that is very 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.500
 good and very easy remove them here not 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.750
 we had and apart you can add it to what 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.590
 better to the pure bottle then cuentitas 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.800
 put much more flirtatious 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.590
 if they liked the paper but so 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.500
 soon 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.900
 also the paper contact the one that is like 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.790
 of plastic and has glue is very 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.090
 well, nothing will happen to you if you 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.090
 wet 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.390
 the perfect collectors 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.709
 we also give you a punishable period 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.709
 the adhesive pencil on this side 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.340
 the unt to this combination we are going to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.340
 you erase 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.300
 and bring all the spi lazio 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.000
 after he reminded you of those 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.630
 so that they do not remain so a little 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.630
 waiting a lot 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.810
 and this we are also going to replicate 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.790
 and well there you can put the soap 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.450
 the aroma that you want to buy 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.849
 gallon and it always comes out cheaper and 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:06.459
 we can make some bath brochures and they 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:10.120
 we could cover it well depending on the 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.609
 decoration and ready this can also go 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.769
 you know that more time I came up with something 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.799
 interesting can go with the wipes 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.199
 what we did in the other week can be 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.020
 a cute little gun gift with the 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.270
 wipes that out there if lashes are 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.210
 stretch and turn routes find them 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.900
 look there are the little bunnies 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:35.510
 we have cupcakes like they put on 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.700
 cut that having done in the soap 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.350
 the final test the acid test goes to 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.880
 make soap out by the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.320
 dispenser I like 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.320
 then this is already dry 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.870
 I introduce a lot of care to save 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.810
 substances like this in these little bottles of 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:00.229
 water because where are the children 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:04.229
 They meet and take them especially if 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:06.150
 I recognize leaving soap 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.380
 there are some toxics that can get there 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.830
 something 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:16.220
 with alcohol it has gone up when not 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.430
 they know they can make a dispenser 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.430
 the help 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.450
 before the day 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:34.059
 it came out of the hands of very neat model 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:36.819
 neat giving orders here our floor 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:39.039
 manager already saw that if it works and 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.419
 we can paste a little bit of gems though 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.119
 do not be talking up here where 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.509
 the crystal was now raise the duckling 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:49.319
 let's put this if green with silicone 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.319
 it never fails 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.889
 it's there 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.889
 as it says martÃ­n piris like you do 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:11.699
 hey it's super what elegance the 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:11.699
 france yes the crazy idea 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.200
 ling ling so what do you think if we 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.440
 let's see the step by step and we go back 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440
 with 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.960
 for the soap dish with the help of the hammer 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.940
 and a nail makes a hole in the 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.610
 bottle cap until you can enter 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.830
 the plastic dispenser removes by a 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.770
 moment the dispenser and with the paint 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.110
 spray decorates the lid inside 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.790
 of the jar with what liquid soap and 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.700
 decorated on the outside with the paintings 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.070
 Acrylic restores the dispenser 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.180
 and sticks crazy and silicon until it is 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.090
 type and it's ready 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.009
 let's hope they have not passed 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.120
 none of our steps and I'm going to 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.800
 give 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:03.340
 the last guy we raise we put a 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.000
 little bit of silicone around to magnify 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.590
 we fix it so that it does not leak and 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.520
 both who you are dancing a 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.139
 excellent option for teachers in the 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.199
 lounge instead of asking each 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.000
 child and be spending so much pep with the 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.800
 rubbish in glass house can 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.180
 make your own dispensers for 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.889
 only the mediocrities 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.199
 then you know that fashion is 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.270
 influence and those things look just what 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:30.610
 pretty so everyone gives them their 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.199
 name or the best they do just me according to 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.010
 they are achieving they are not cutting and 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.010
 we come back with more
