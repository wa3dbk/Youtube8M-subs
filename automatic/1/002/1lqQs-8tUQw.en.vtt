00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.689
 hello welcome to the video from the go to 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.210
 feature 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.400
 we discuss in this video how 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.820
 escape for a feature implemented 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.920
 becomes 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.000
 we discuss the history of the go 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.520
 concept go to a go a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.610
 Mortgages discuss what energy works 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.060
 chain is and will be an example to the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.949
 for cadbury 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 we also discuss what you are under 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.990
 polyphony and polygamy understands 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 in the nineteenth century the 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.760
 counter-concept introduced after 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.850
 male concept were genes inheritance 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.100
 Units that influenced the feature 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.289
 At this time the ba announced that one 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.379
 genotype of an organism ie the 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.930
 Herbs for the phenotypes so that 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.699
 appearance is responsible for 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.359
 researchers of this time were gene 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.040
 originally pure thought construct 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.079
 comes at the beginning of the twentieth century 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.820
 Tomorrow and his colleagues features 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.350
 certain sections of the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.020
 to arrange chromosomes 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.869
 The British physician Jarrett had the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.659
 presumption expressed that gene the blueprint 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.569
 for enzymes must contain 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.249
 human with metabolic diseases 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:20.409
 after having a bug in the 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.569
 have corresponding go and 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.969
 can not make this enzyme 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.819
 40 years later , the 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.630
 americans offer and tatum enter into that 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:35.310
