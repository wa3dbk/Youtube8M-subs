I<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:39.210> part<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.229> reason<00:01:40.260> I'm<00:01:40.740> able<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I think part of the reason I'm able to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859 
I think part of the reason I'm able to
accomplish<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.820> much<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.330> I'm<00:01:42.570> able<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
accomplish so much is that I'm able to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
accomplish so much is that I'm able to
take<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.409> away<00:01:43.460> for<00:01:44.460> things<00:01:44.760> like<00:01:44.909> capoeira

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
take time away for things like capoeira

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.180 
take time away for things like capoeira
i<00:01:45.840> mean--the<00:01:46.110> upward<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.770> thing<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
i mean--the upward is the thing that I

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.310 
i mean--the upward is the thing that I
do<00:01:47.310> outside<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.330> thing<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.810> right

bit<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:04.710> those<00:02:05.460> two<00:02:05.670> things<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.830> think

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
bit of those two things you know I think

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.090 
bit of those two things you know I think
that<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.729> could<00:02:08.970> stand<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.769> bartenders<00:02:10.769> to<00:02:10.800> get

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
that we could stand as bartenders to get

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.449 
that we could stand as bartenders to get
a<00:02:11.130> little<00:02:11.280> bit<00:02:11.550> outside<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.880> our<00:02:12.090> comfort<00:02:12.239> zone

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
a little bit outside of our comfort zone

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.380 
a little bit outside of our comfort zone
that's<00:02:14.459> huge<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.090> me<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.790> am<00:02:17.790> super

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's huge for me to like I am super

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.690 
that's huge for me to like I am super
comfortable<00:02:18.930> month<00:02:19.170> behind<00:02:19.320> my<00:02:19.620> bar<00:02:19.800> I'll<00:02:20.100> run

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
comfortable month behind my bar I'll run

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.340 
comfortable month behind my bar I'll run
up<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:20.940> down<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.450> run<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.810> thing<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.200> my

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
up and down it I run that thing it's my

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.309 
up and down it I run that thing it's my
show<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.450> getting<00:02:24.450> outside<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
show and getting outside of that is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.740 
show and getting outside of that is
really<00:02:25.590> hard<00:02:25.830> for<00:02:26.400> me<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.269> think<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.569> hard

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
really hard for me and I think it's hard

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.840 
really hard for me and I think it's hard
for<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> lot<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.140> us<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.700> get

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
for a lot of us and so if you can get

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.400 
for a lot of us and so if you can get
outside<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.630> something<00:02:31.050> kind<00:02:31.290> of

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
outside of that and do something kind of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.120 
outside of that and do something kind of
weird<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.980> an<00:02:32.750> afro-brazilian<00:02:33.750> martial<00:02:34.380> art

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
weird like an afro-brazilian martial art

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.270
