ok everyone welcome back to the pad
print<00:00:03.510> process<00:00:03.720> channel<00:00:04.259> here<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:05.040> promised

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
print process channel here I promised

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.190 
print process channel here I promised
originally<00:00:06.180> we're<00:00:06.420> gonna<00:00:06.509> start<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:06.930> very

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
originally we're gonna start with very

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.440 
originally we're gonna start with very
basic<00:00:07.410> very<00:00:07.950> short<00:00:08.280> segments<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:08.880> things<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
basic very short segments on things and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.930 
basic very short segments on things and
the<00:00:10.200> first<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.280> prove<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.730> out

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the first one is going to prove that out

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.580 
the first one is going to prove that out
here<00:00:12.240> I'm<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> start<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.320> something

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
here I'm going to start with something

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.620 
here I'm going to start with something
that<00:00:14.040> has<00:00:14.280> almost<00:00:14.820> nothing<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.389> with<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
that has almost nothing to do with the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.970 
that has almost nothing to do with the
process<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> very<00:00:16.710> very

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
process it's just the very very

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790 
process it's just the very very
beginning<00:00:17.220> which<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.439> correct<00:00:19.439> selection

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
beginning which is the correct selection

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.939 
beginning which is the correct selection
of<00:00:20.189> cups<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.820> mix<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.210> ink<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.740> not<00:00:22.740> ink

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
of cups to mix your ink in not ink

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.670 
of cups to mix your ink in not ink
mixing<00:00:23.400> not<00:00:23.760> how<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.060> mix<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> ratios

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
mixing not how you mix me not the ratios

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.519 
mixing not how you mix me not the ratios
nothing<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.640> simply<00:00:27.390> where<00:00:28.349> you

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
nothing like that just simply where you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.229 
nothing like that just simply where you
do<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:30.320> there<00:00:31.320> are<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> lot<00:00:32.189> of

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
do it so here we go there are a lot of

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.549 
do it so here we go there are a lot of
there<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.360> only<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> couple<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> good<00:00:34.350> choices

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
there are only a couple of good choices

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
there are only a couple of good choices
for<00:00:34.829> cups<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.820> mixing<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.180> there<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> lot

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
for cups and mixing and there are a lot

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.380 
for cups and mixing and there are a lot
of<00:00:36.870> bad<00:00:37.230> choices<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.090> believe<00:00:39.090> me<00:00:39.210> when<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
of bad choices and I believe me when I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.639 
of bad choices and I believe me when I
start<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:39.840> something<00:00:40.200> simple<00:00:40.530> like

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
start out with something simple like

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.900 
start out with something simple like
this<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.190> I've<00:00:41.489> seen<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
this it's because I've seen it in the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
this it's because I've seen it in the
field<00:00:42.149> over<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.140> over<00:00:43.410> again

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
field over and over and over again

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
field over and over and over again
a<00:00:43.950> lot<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> choices<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.120> people<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a lot of choices that people make that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.950 
a lot of choices that people make that
are<00:00:46.520> they<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:47.910> penny<00:00:48.120> wide<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.719> they

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
are they think are penny wide or they

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
are they think are penny wide or they
think<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.350> saving<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> money<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.820> end<00:00:50.969> up

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
think are saving the money but end up

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.170 
think are saving the money but end up
costing<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.539> trouble<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.520> let's<00:00:54.030> start

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
costing them trouble but let's start

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.850 
costing them trouble but let's start
with<00:00:54.360> something<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.690> simple<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.649> off

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
with something really simple first off

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.470 
with something really simple first off
you<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> solvent<00:00:56.850> resistant<00:00:57.300> cup

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you need to have a solvent resistant cup

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.229 
you need to have a solvent resistant cup
so<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> gate<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.520> styrofoam<00:00:59.969> cups

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so out of the gate the styrofoam cups

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.090 
so out of the gate the styrofoam cups
whether<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> ones<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
whether it's this or the ones that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
whether it's this or the ones that
Dunkin<00:01:02.399> Donuts<00:01:02.670> come<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:04.049> hit<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.320> with

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Dunkin Donuts come in you hit this with

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.130 
Dunkin Donuts come in you hit this with
solvent<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.159> melt<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> bottom<00:01:05.670> out

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
solvent you're gonna melt the bottom out

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.910 
solvent you're gonna melt the bottom out
and<00:01:07.820> obviously<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.540> cake<00:01:10.170> cup<00:01:10.380> something<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and obviously a cake cup something like

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
and obviously a cake cup something like
that<00:01:11.159> also<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.939> problem<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.170> may<00:01:13.380> find

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that also a problem now you may find

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.050 
that also a problem now you may find
some<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.400> resistant<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
some that are a little more resistant to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
some that are a little more resistant to
the<00:01:15.150> solvent<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> solvent

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the solvent that you have or the solvent

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
the solvent that you have or the solvent
you're<00:01:16.950> using<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.729> aggressive<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you're using it's not so aggressive that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
you're using it's not so aggressive that
it<00:01:19.890> melts<00:01:20.189> immediately<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> problem<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it melts immediately but the problem is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.460 
it melts immediately but the problem is
if<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> melts<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:24.140> plastic<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
if it melts at all that plastic is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
if it melts at all that plastic is
getting<00:01:25.770> into<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.280> binder<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.000> inking

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
getting into your binder and your inking

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
getting into your binder and your inking
is<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> affect<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.259> adhesion<00:01:28.799> your

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is going to affect your adhesion your

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
is going to affect your adhesion your
pot<00:01:29.520> life<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.479> stuff<00:01:30.630> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
pot life and all that kind of stuff so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.359 
pot life and all that kind of stuff so
but<00:01:31.049> definitely<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.829> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
but definitely what you want to do is

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
but definitely what you want to do is
take<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> look<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> bottom<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> says

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
take a look at the bottom and if it says

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.340 
take a look at the bottom and if it says
something<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:35.270> styrene<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> bottom<00:01:37.020> get

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
something like styrene on the bottom get

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
something like styrene on the bottom get
rid<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.400> foam<00:01:38.610> Cup<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.210> rid<00:01:39.390> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
rid of that it's a foam Cup get rid of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.740 
rid of that it's a foam Cup get rid of
it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.569 
it
if<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.470> some<00:01:40.500> reason<00:01:40.950> you're<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.220> doubt<00:01:41.400> about

if for some reason you're in doubt about

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.060 
if for some reason you're in doubt about
this<00:01:42.170> porcelain<00:01:43.170> spinner<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.860> let<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this porcelain spinner in it and let it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.499 
this porcelain spinner in it and let it
sit<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.250> an<00:01:44.460> hour<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> goes

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
sit for an hour and see how it goes

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.420 
sit for an hour and see how it goes
it'll<00:01:45.869> probably<00:01:46.350> melt<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> bottom<00:01:48.140> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
it'll probably melt out the bottom the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.710 
it'll probably melt out the bottom the
next<00:01:50.430> thing<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:51.000> people<00:01:51.030> doing<00:01:51.450> all

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
next thing that I see people doing all

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.090 
next thing that I see people doing all
the<00:01:51.840> time<00:01:52.020> they're<00:01:52.259> trying<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> save<00:01:52.770> money<00:01:52.979> on

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the time they're trying to save money on

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
the time they're trying to save money on
is<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.850> use<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.299> ink<00:01:54.450> Cup<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.649> they

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
is to use an ink Cup they think if they

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
is to use an ink Cup they think if they
can<00:01:55.829> put<00:01:56.100> their<00:01:56.250> ink<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.060> they're<00:01:57.149> thinner

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
can put their ink in and they're thinner

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
can put their ink in and they're thinner
in<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:57.899> stir<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:59.790> that's<00:02:00.060> going

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
in and then stir it up that that's going

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.819 
in and then stir it up that that's going
to<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.780> solution<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.409> problem<00:02:01.439> with

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
to be a good solution the problem with

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
to be a good solution the problem with
that<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.280> course<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:03.180> can't<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that is of course you can't really get a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.270 
that is of course you can't really get a
good<00:02:04.290> mix<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> also<00:02:07.280> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
good mix going on in there and also you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.110 
good mix going on in there and also you
are<00:02:09.410> your<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.679> original<00:02:11.430> whole<00:02:11.670> sorts<00:02:12.030> of

are your your original whole sorts of

know you save a penny on a cup and you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.630 
know you save a penny on a cup and you

spend $250 on the doctor and you're in

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.880 
spend $250 on the doctor and you're in
all<00:02:19.730> sorts<00:02:19.969> of<00:02:20.030> trouble<00:02:20.680> normally<00:02:21.680> in

all sorts of trouble normally in

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.640 
all sorts of trouble normally in
conjunction<00:02:22.280> with<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.819> level<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.650> poor

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
conjunction with this level of poor

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
conjunction with this level of poor
choice<00:02:24.890> making<00:02:25.189> is<00:02:25.700> also<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> use<00:02:26.299> of<00:02:26.329> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
choice making is also the use of a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.809 
choice making is also the use of a
screwdriver<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.920> process<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.459> doing<00:02:28.609> it

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
screwdriver in the process of doing it

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.759 
screwdriver in the process of doing it
and<00:02:29.209> obviously<00:02:29.689> if<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.930> had<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.230> ring<00:02:30.439> on<00:02:30.590> here

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and obviously if I had the ring on here

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.379 
and obviously if I had the ring on here
I<00:02:30.920> would<00:02:31.069> have<00:02:31.099> cracked<00:02:31.579> the<00:02:31.760> ring<00:02:31.969> I<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.269> it

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:32.389 
I would have cracked the ring I see it

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.690 
I would have cracked the ring I see it
happen<00:02:32.659> all<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.900> time<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:34.340> other<00:02:34.430> thing<00:02:34.670> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
happen all the time the other thing that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.209 
happen all the time the other thing that

of<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.079> gate<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.769> problem<00:02:52.069> with<00:02:52.159> this<00:02:52.280> is<00:02:52.459> if

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
of the gate the problem with this is if

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.909 
of the gate the problem with this is if
you<00:02:52.819> want<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.269> run<00:02:53.510> your<00:02:54.139> thumbnail<00:02:54.590> across

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
you want and run your thumbnail across

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.190 
you want and run your thumbnail across
it<00:02:55.189> like<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.209> you'll<00:02:56.419> find<00:02:56.689> that<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.900> inside

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
it like this you'll find that the inside

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.170 
it like this you'll find that the inside
is<00:02:57.230> wax-coated<00:02:57.919> you<00:02:58.519> get<00:02:58.669> a<00:02:58.700> little<00:02:58.879> wax<00:02:59.030> on

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
is wax-coated you get a little wax on

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.339 
is wax-coated you get a little wax on
your<00:02:59.209> framing<00:02:59.480> I'll<00:02:59.599> you<00:02:59.689> can<00:02:59.780> see<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.019> shiny

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
your framing I'll you can see the shiny

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.349 
your framing I'll you can see the shiny
that's<00:03:01.280> great<00:03:01.639> for<00:03:01.849> when<00:03:01.969> you're<00:03:02.060> commuting

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
that's great for when you're commuting

is<00:05:06.260> going<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.680> contaminate<00:05:06.980> your<00:05:07.340> ink<00:05:07.520> process

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
is going to contaminate your ink process

is going to contaminate your ink process
in<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.120> next<00:05:08.270> step<00:05:08.600> so<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.410> best<00:05:09.590> solution

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
in the next step so the best solution

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.590 
in the next step so the best solution
before<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.340> even<00:05:10.490> start<00:05:10.820> anything<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.390> just

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
before you even start anything is just

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.440 
before you even start anything is just
to<00:05:11.720> call<00:05:11.900> up<00:05:12.080> order<00:05:12.740> some<00:05:12.890> cups<00:05:13.100> or<00:05:13.669> you<00:05:14.330> know

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
to call up order some cups or you know

to call up order some cups or you know
you<00:05:14.540> can<00:05:14.660> do<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.870> from<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.110> local<00:05:15.380> supply<00:05:15.680> store

you can do it from a local supply store

we have them here and this is what I

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.050

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
suggest they can get them in different

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.550 
suggest they can get them in different
sizes<00:05:23.510> so<00:05:23.720> if<00:05:23.870> you're<00:05:23.960> using<00:05:24.080> one<00:05:24.350> of<00:05:24.380> our

sizes so if you're using one of our

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.770 
sizes so if you're using one of our
larger<00:05:24.890> machines<00:05:25.190> if<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.400> get<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.580> much<00:05:26.390> larger

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
larger machines if you get a much larger

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.650 
larger machines if you get a much larger
cup<00:05:26.990> more<00:05:27.320> like<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.730> iced<00:05:28.730> latte<00:05:29.150> size<00:05:29.390> cup
