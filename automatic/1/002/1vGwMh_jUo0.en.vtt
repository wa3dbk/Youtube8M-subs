00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pretty quick plus it makes for a quicker

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.889 
pretty quick plus it makes for a quicker
video<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> truth<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.430> told<00:00:56.460> they're<00:00:57.210> the

tyrants<00:00:58.440> don't<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.010> harder<00:00:59.430> just

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
tyrants don't really get harder just

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700 
tyrants don't really get harder just
because<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.090> choose<00:01:00.590> professional<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> mean

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
because you choose professional I mean

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.470 
because you choose professional I mean
obviously<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.250> take<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.609> more<00:01:02.820> damage<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
obviously they take off more damage and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
obviously they take off more damage and
you<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.379> hurt<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.460> their

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you don't hurt them as much but their

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.990 
you don't hurt them as much but their
pattern<00:01:06.240> stays<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> same<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.520> couple

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
pattern stays the same they do a couple

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
pattern stays the same they do a couple
of<00:01:09.090> things<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.659> they'll<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.590> big<00:01:11.010> smash

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
of things one they'll do that big smash

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.320 
of things one they'll do that big smash
you<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.270> saw<00:01:12.390> him<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.810> his<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.140> hand

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
you just saw him do with his right hand

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
you just saw him do with his right hand
they'll<00:01:15.330> show<00:01:15.600> their<00:01:15.840> face<00:01:16.080> periodically<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
they'll show their face periodically to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600 
they'll show their face periodically to
keep<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> bullets<00:01:18.600> away<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.220> guess

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
keep the bullets away and then I guess

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
keep the bullets away and then I guess
when<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.600> hit<00:01:21.810> markers

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
when I do that you don't get hit markers

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.800 
when I do that you don't get hit markers
as<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> notice<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> lot<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
as much and I know I notice a lot of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.679 
as much and I know I notice a lot of
times<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.530> right<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:26.150> not<00:01:27.150> getting<00:01:27.450> any

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
times like right there not getting any

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.740 
times like right there not getting any
hit<00:01:27.900> markers<00:01:28.759> then<00:01:29.759> I'll<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.150> charge<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750

just<00:01:30.930> saw<00:01:31.079> him<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> me<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.119> choose<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
just saw him do to me you can choose to

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
just saw him do to me you can choose to
dodge<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.500> left<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
dodge like left and right but the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
dodge like left and right but the
problem<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> hallway<00:01:36.630> makes<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
problem is this hallway makes it a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
problem is this hallway makes it a
little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.409> difficult<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.189> left<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
little bit difficult to go left and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.429 
little bit difficult to go left and
right<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.659> still<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.110> hit<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439

the truth be told he is he'll still hit
you<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:43.170> bit<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> dive<00:01:43.799> kind<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you a little bit if you dive kind of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.940 
you a little bit if you dive kind of
forward<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.939> did<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.930> um<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.470> mean<00:01:46.829> I'm

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
this like a very long fight because it

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.449 
this like a very long fight because it
