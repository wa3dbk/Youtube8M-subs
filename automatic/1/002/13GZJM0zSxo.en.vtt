00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.270 
Center is going to have a circle and
that<00:04:07.420> means<00:04:07.660> you're<00:04:07.780> off<00:04:07.960> all<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.920> way<00:04:09.040> back

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
that means you're off all the way back

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.520 
that means you're off all the way back
is<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.640> 1<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.570> this<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.900> going<00:04:11.020> to<00:04:11.140> mean<00:04:11.350> that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
it's going to save battery because it

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.690 
it's going to save battery because it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
we're riding a day light we're going to

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.370 
we're riding a day light we're going to
press<00:04:38.020> down<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.410> number<00:04:38.680> 1<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:40.810> about<00:04:41.080> 3

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
press down to the number 1 in about 3

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.930 
press down to the number 1 in about 3
seconds<00:04:41.860> it's<00:04:42.040> going<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.250> lock<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.610> up<00:04:42.640> with

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
seconds it's going to lock you up with

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.460 
seconds it's going to lock you up with
the<00:04:43.030> board<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.510> you're<00:04:43.600> ready<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.930> go<00:04:44.140> at<00:04:44.290> that

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
the board and you're ready to go at that

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.380 
the board and you're ready to go at that
point<00:04:44.770> all<00:04:44.980> of<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.460> thick<00:04:45.760> remotes<00:04:46.120> can

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
point all of the thick remotes can

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.360 
point all of the thick remotes can
control<00:04:46.750> any<00:04:46.990> thick<00:04:47.260> electric<00:04:47.680> skateboard<00:04:47.890> so

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
control any thick electric skateboard so

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.950 
control any thick electric skateboard so
do<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:48.700> careful<00:04:48.880> when<00:04:49.270> you're<00:04:49.390> trying<00:04:49.600> to<00:04:49.720> link

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
do be careful when you're trying to link

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.510 
do be careful when you're trying to link
up<00:04:50.110> multiple<00:04:50.530> boards<00:04:50.890> at<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.040> same<00:04:51.280> time

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
up multiple boards at the same time

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.220 
up multiple boards at the same time
because<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.000> can<00:04:52.150> actually<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.660> one<00:04:52.900> remote

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
because you can actually get one remote

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.570 
because you can actually get one remote
on<00:04:53.440> another<00:04:53.740> board<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.310> then<00:04:54.400> your<00:04:54.550> control

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
on another board and then your control

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.700 
on another board and then your control
however<00:04:56.060> once<00:04:56.660> it<00:04:56.810> gets<00:04:56.930> out<00:04:57.050> of<00:04:57.080> range<00:04:57.410> which

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
however once it gets out of range which

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.500 
however once it gets out of range which
is<00:04:57.740> about<00:04:58.040> two<00:04:58.280> feet<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.790> remote<00:04:59.090> will<00:04:59.240> stop

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
is about two feet the remote will stop

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.150 
is about two feet the remote will stop
controlling<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.110> board<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.770> now<00:05:00.920> we're<00:05:01.070> going

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
controlling the board so now we're going

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.770 
controlling the board so now we're going
to<00:05:01.220> talk<00:05:01.370> about<00:05:01.520> acceleration<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.540> braking

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
to talk about acceleration and braking

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.690 
to talk about acceleration and braking
right<00:05:03.500> here<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.830> have<00:05:03.860> your<00:05:03.980> trigger<00:05:04.370> so

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
right here you have your trigger so

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.460 
right here you have your trigger so
you're<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.060> slightly<00:05:05.389> pull<00:05:05.840> back<00:05:06.169> and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
you're going to slightly pull back and

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.390 
you're going to slightly pull back and
that's<00:05:06.680> going<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.950> give<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.190> some

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
that's going to give you some

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.129 
that's going to give you some
acceleration<00:05:07.700> whenever<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:08.810> want<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.080> stop

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
acceleration whenever you want to stop

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.290 
acceleration whenever you want to stop
we<00:05:09.740> recommend<00:05:10.190> that<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.340> slowly<00:05:10.730> let<00:05:11.060> off<00:05:11.180> the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
we recommend that you slowly let off the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.970 
we recommend that you slowly let off the
acceleration<00:05:12.050> because<00:05:12.320> if<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:12.530> let<00:05:12.650> off<00:05:12.800> all

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
acceleration because if you let off all

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.470 
acceleration because if you let off all
at<00:05:13.130> once<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:13.520> going<00:05:13.669> to<00:05:13.730> lunge<00:05:13.940> you<00:05:14.060> forward

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
at once it's going to lunge you forward

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.330 
at once it's going to lunge you forward
when<00:05:15.139> you're<00:05:15.260> sitting<00:05:15.620> still<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:16.040> you<00:05:16.100> begin

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
when you're sitting still and you begin

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.740 
when you're sitting still and you begin
to<00:05:16.430> accelerate<00:05:16.730> you<00:05:17.060> want<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.300> brace<00:05:17.540> with

your<00:05:17.870> back<00:05:18.050> foot<00:05:18.380> just<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.680> make<00:05:18.830> sure<00:05:18.860> it's

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
your back foot just to make sure it's

there<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.770> braking<00:05:28.250> system<00:05:28.640> all<00:05:28.940> you're

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
there is a braking system all you're

there is a braking system all you're
going<00:05:29.480> to<00:05:29.540> do<00:05:29.720> is<00:05:29.960> take<00:05:30.290> your<00:05:30.440> remote<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.070> get
