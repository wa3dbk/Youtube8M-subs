00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
let's get started with the transformers

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
let's get started with the transformers
4<00:00:28.710> news<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:30.359> been<00:00:30.480> revealed<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
4 news it has been revealed that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.790 
4 news it has been revealed that
bumblebee<00:00:31.890> will<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.989> 2014<00:00:33.989> camaro<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
bumblebee will be a 2014 camaro and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920 
bumblebee will be a 2014 camaro and
you're<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.239> thought<00:00:36.480> he<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
you're like what I thought he was this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
you're like what I thought he was this
old<00:00:37.170> Camaro<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.800> saw<00:00:37.980> before<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> think

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
old Camaro that we saw before so I think

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.600 
old Camaro that we saw before so I think
you<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:39.960> correct<00:00:40.320> he<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.370> both

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you are correct he is going to be both

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.490 
you are correct he is going to be both
so<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.300> guessing<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.840> he<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.379> out

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so I'm guessing that he will start out

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
so I'm guessing that he will start out
with<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.010> old<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.210> assuming<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with the old one now I'm assuming this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360 
with the old one now I'm assuming this
and<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.350> are<00:00:46.530> pictured<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> screen

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and these are pictured on the screen

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.000 
and these are pictured on the screen
right<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.660> he<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:48.989> scan<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> then

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
right now and then he will scan and then

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.389 
right now and then he will scan and then
become<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.940> new<00:00:51.140> 2014<00:00:52.140> Camaro<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.340> guess

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
become the new 2014 Camaro so I guess

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
become the new 2014 Camaro so I guess
more<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> better<00:00:54.239> especially<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.199> you're

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
more is better especially if you're

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
more is better especially if you're
hasbro<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.760> toys

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
hasbro because then you get more toys

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
hasbro because then you get more toys
and<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.809> money<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> would

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and you get more money so that would

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
and you get more money so that would
make<00:00:59.100> sense<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.699> since<00:01:00.329> bumblebees<00:01:00.780> kind<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
make sense and since bumblebees kind of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.369 
make sense and since bumblebees kind of
like<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.410> co-star<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.190> Optimus<00:01:02.820> he's<00:01:03.600> lovable

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like a co-star with Optimus he's lovable

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.050 
like a co-star with Optimus he's lovable
for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.949> kids<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> moms<00:01:05.700> think

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
for the little kids and the moms think

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.450 
for the little kids and the moms think
he's<00:01:06.240> cute<00:01:06.540> he<00:01:07.200> makes<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.130> good

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
he's cute he makes for like a good

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
he's cute he makes for like a good
couple<00:01:09.090> toys<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.720> make<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> purchase

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

couple toys to make for them to purchase

and in my opinion I wish they could have

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
and in my opinion I wish they could have
kind<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> went<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> new<00:01:14.490> co-star<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.240> would

kind of went with a new co-star it would

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.670 
kind of went with a new co-star it would
have<00:01:15.420> been<00:01:15.479> cooler<00:01:15.750> seeing<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.170> Wheeljack

or somebody with Optimus because then it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.120

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
focus on one specifically right now and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
focus on one specifically right now and
that<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.570> truck<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.649> looks<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that is the truck now this looks like a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
that is the truck now this looks like a
Decepticon<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> colors<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
Decepticon because of the colors and I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
Decepticon because of the colors and I
have<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:52.530> guesses<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.490> nemesis

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
have two guesses on this one nemesis

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
have two guesses on this one nemesis
prime<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.079> hoping<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.500> won't<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
prime which I'm hoping it won't be and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.760 
prime which I'm hoping it won't be and
number<00:01:56.729> two<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.329> motor<00:01:57.750> master<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.590> would

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
number two is motor master which would

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
number two is motor master which would
be<00:01:58.890> epic<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.180> you'd<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
be epic because then you'd have the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.840 
be epic because then you'd have the
stunt<00:02:01.110> icons<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:02.100> would<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.369> four<00:02:02.670> min

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
stunt icons and they would all four min

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.840 
stunt icons and they would all four min
to<00:02:03.030> Menace<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.229> which<00:02:05.009> would<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.340> an<00:02:05.610> epic

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to Menace or which would be an epic

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.570 
to Menace or which would be an epic
battle<00:02:06.270> who<00:02:06.630> doesn't<00:02:07.140> love<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.920> stunt<00:02:08.250> econo

who doesn't love any combat account

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.930 
who doesn't love any combat account
because<00:02:10.830> those<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.520> make<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:11.910> epic<00:02:12.330> battles

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940
