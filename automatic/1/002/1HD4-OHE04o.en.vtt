really<00:00:22.890> tight<00:00:23.130> kick<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.880> could<00:00:24.029> also<00:00:24.150> tune<00:00:24.480> it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
really tight kick we could also tune it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.400 
really tight kick we could also tune it
differently<00:00:26.930> another<00:00:27.930> thing<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
differently another thing we can do is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.050 
differently another thing we can do is
just<00:00:28.500> degenerate<00:00:28.859> Lear<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.460> zit<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.789> go<00:00:29.910> over

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
just degenerate Lear a zit we go over

like you know rock we can also change
the<00:00:40.020> dynamics<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.760> whether<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> gets

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the dynamics of as to whether it gets

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
the dynamics of as to whether it gets
soft<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.750> loud<00:00:42.930> depending<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.800> how<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.100> played

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
here see nice and soft or we can get it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
here see nice and soft or we can get it

good old space to it that's my raised in
the<00:01:26.460> room<00:01:26.720> could<00:01:27.720> raise<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> snare<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> the

the room could raise the snare and the
overheads<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> we're<00:01:29.549> affecting<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.450> way

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
overheads and we're affecting the way

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
overheads and we're affecting the way
not<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.070> way<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.520> sound<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> as

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
not just the way it would sound that as

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
not just the way it would sound that as
a<00:01:33.000> snare<00:01:33.329> mic<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:33.930> affecting<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> way

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
a snare mic but we're affecting the way

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
a snare mic but we're affecting the way
it<00:01:34.590> sounds<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> room<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.820> raise<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it sounds in the room you can raise and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
it sounds in the room you can raise and
adjust<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.490> particular

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
adjust all this just for one particular

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.580 
adjust all this just for one particular
part<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> drum<00:01:39.900> set<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.229> i<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
part of the drum set which i think is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:49.039 
part of the drum set which i think is
really<00:01:40.680> cool<00:01:40.979> moving<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> hi-hat<00:01:48.049> key

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
really cool moving on the hi-hat key

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.240 
really cool moving on the hi-hat key
thing<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> highs<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> usually<00:01:50.130> don't

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
thing about the highs we usually don't

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
thing about the highs we usually don't
want<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> center<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.329> pan<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:54.350> left

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
want in the center so we can pan it left

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.940 
want in the center so we can pan it left
or<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:56.990> we<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.110> also<00:01:58.229> raise<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> pitch<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
or right we can also raise the pitch of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.350 
or right we can also raise the pitch of
it<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.590> or<00:02:01.590> lower

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
it if you want to do that or lower

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.190 
it if you want to do that or lower
change<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> dynamics<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.790> really<00:02:05.790> loud

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
change the dynamics of it really loud
