00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.700
 I bring you a new video that so much 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.470
 like you the videos of the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.630
 minecraft trailer analysis of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.509
 clubs 360 of the new update the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 1.8 point 2 and this is a new trailer 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 that just took 4j studies on the day of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 today down here in the description les 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.760
 I leave the links of the channel and the video by 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.020
 if you want to check them and while here 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.020
 I leave you with the description 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.010
 and here we start paying the images in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 the video and as you can see they remember 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.810
 of the analysis images the other 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.310
 time the last good video was a radish 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.290
 here we are seeing what is a 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.910
 assessment that is this is good this 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.890
 it's like a structure that is in the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.450
 earth is like a big crack like 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.950
 You could see here at the beginning of the video 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.070
 like a crack that our 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.720
 worlds and you are huge yourself 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.940
 also the images to see how 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.630
 is this from the rÃ¼hr bain so we're going to 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.630
 follow the video 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.920
 no no 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.289
 here we have what is the main set the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 abandoned mine these mines are very 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.810
 particular because they are 3 wide and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.880
 practically 3 high of 4 high in 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.920
 some in these on the computer 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.479
 we can find chests a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.820
 times offered by those who can 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.880
 find diamond or coconut grains to 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.679
 other of those things and here in particular 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.240
 I want to turn off the video because for the 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.340
 who have never played blacks 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.110
 computer like me and would like to know a 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.090
 little more of this update as 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.430
 you can see here the little hearts are 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.380
 highlighted and the food bar is 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.269
 completely so I 'll explain 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.220
 How does this food bar work? 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.890
 if you do not know tell them this bar 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.480
 food works when we have 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.150
 the entire food bar fills up as it is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.860
 this case we are never going to die of 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.900
 hungry this as you can see the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.910
 hearts regenerate automatically 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.670
 when we have all the life of food 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.410
 filled when the food when the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.910
 food bar is not full we started 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.190
 to lose hearts and really 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.750
 We started eating life and simply 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.980
 will fill in when our bar 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.690
 food is full 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.909
 and how do we keep the food bar 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.830
 full as it is constantly eating 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:55.349
 so now we're going to be able to interact 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.349
 more with the food and continue with the video 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.750
 n 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.900
 here is another image of which both 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.970
 they like you the invisible but 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.190
 here in main I wanted to stand out for that 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.290
 father here the video as you can see already 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 they saw no longer calm nothing like that is the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.180
 glass panels are 9 these new 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.800
 glass tools there they saw how 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.330
 in this villa in this little house here 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.160
 can see how it is no longer a crystal 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.260
 square there you can see how it is 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.390
 a crystal panel and this is what 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 main here that we liked also 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.650
 I had heard rumors that the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.690
 invisibility that are the villas that are 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.520
 generated in our worlds are not going to 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.140
 leave unfortunately in this 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.270
 update but until the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.950
 next update I do not know if it's 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.990
 until the update of a patch what 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.210
 I know but I had heard that they are not going to 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.340
 come out hopefully and this is not true and 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.320
 we're just going to run with the last 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.880
 image of the video with the last video the 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.880
 last part of the video sorry 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.460
 ah 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.539
 and good and finally to see if who 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.069
 I did not end up stuck me here again for 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.770
 last we have what is being the 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.960
 stronghold that we comments from 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.030
 thanks to the suvs they clarified me the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.250
 stronghold is not what it is 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.039
 bookstore that we live in the image the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.409
 stronghold is practically all the 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.539
 mine that is down as it was with this 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.919
 shape of the stone blocks all this 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.319
 of iron doors and this as 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.389
 labyrinth that sometimes has up to have 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.460
 jails bars all this this what 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.500
 comes being the stronghold here in the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.110
 stronghold is where we are going to find the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.849
 portal to the inder word that you 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.669
 they will even know that today in sleeves of 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.470
 computer that to take out his eyes 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.330
 they launch they are selling towards 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.190
 here and practically what it is that the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.770
 bookstore in some of the cases is 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.840
 near the bookstore of the inder world and 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.849
 that's just what it shows us in 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.229
 this video another thing that I also want 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.539
 highlight here is that I do not know if it 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.490
 they agree the last video of trailer no 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.039
 is the first trailer video forgiveness that 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.680
 they took the first analysis where I show 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.780
 as the little girl we activate this as 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.759

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.370

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.290
 watch 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.360

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.210
 our armor reminds them we do not know 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.250
 if this serves too much so with the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.080
