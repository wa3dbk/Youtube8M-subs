that<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> other<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> thought<00:00:33.870> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that and the other thing so I thought I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.799 
that and the other thing so I thought I
would<00:00:34.079> try<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.550> think<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.910> way<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.540> try<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
would try and think of a way to try and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.500 
would try and think of a way to try and
demonstrate<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> different<00:00:38.910> effects<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
of game and what I came up with was

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.600 
of game and what I came up with was
let's<00:00:47.370> take<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> look<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.850> first<00:00:48.030> block<00:00:49.610> if

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
let's take a look at this first block if

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.080 
let's take a look at this first block if
I<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.449> thin<00:00:52.199> layer<00:00:52.530> soap<00:00:54.379> over<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:56.100> thin

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I put a thin layer soap over a thin

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.569 
I put a thin layer soap over a thin
layer<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.600> aluminum<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:59.640> simulate<00:00:59.940> bone

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
layer of aluminum to simulate bone

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.580 
layer of aluminum to simulate bone
followed<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:05.000> glycerin<00:01:06.000> soap<00:01:06.540> soaked<00:01:07.200> piece

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
followed by a glycerin soap soaked piece

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.190 
followed by a glycerin soap soaked piece
of<00:01:07.830> cardboard<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.180> simulate<00:01:09.680> more<00:01:10.680> bone<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
of cardboard to simulate more bone and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.570 
of cardboard to simulate more bone and
resistance<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.860> followed<00:01:14.280> closely

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
resistance on that and followed closely

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.260 
resistance on that and followed closely
by<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> piece<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.570> clay<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.140> simulate<00:01:17.270> soft

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
by a piece of clay to simulate soft

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
by a piece of clay to simulate soft
tissue<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> heart<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> brain<00:01:20.159> or

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
tissue like a heart or a brain or

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
tissue like a heart or a brain or
something<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> behind<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:22.650> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
something like that behind what would be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
something like that behind what would be
considered<00:01:22.890> an<00:01:23.400> armor<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> skull<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
considered an armor or a skull and I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.700 
considered an armor or a skull and I
think<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> came<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.549> cool<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> let's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
think it came out really cool so let's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
think it came out really cool so let's
go<00:01:28.829> over<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.250> more<00:01:29.400> time<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.820> glycerin

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
go over it one more time the glycerin

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.260 
go over it one more time the glycerin
soap<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> far<00:01:31.079> left<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.770> block

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
soap on the far left of this block

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
soap on the far left of this block
represents<00:01:33.270> skin<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.659> fat<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> muscle<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

all<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> type<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> stuff<00:01:35.630> then<00:01:36.630> we

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
all that type of stuff then we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.539 
all that type of stuff then we
immediately<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> aluminum<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
immediately see the aluminum that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
immediately see the aluminum that
represents<00:01:39.150> bone<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:40.350> bone<00:01:40.590> backed<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.250> by
