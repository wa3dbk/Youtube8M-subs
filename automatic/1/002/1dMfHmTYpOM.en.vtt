and<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.780> was<00:03:01.930> also<00:03:02.110> because<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:02.950> say<00:03:03.160> was

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
and it was also because like I say was

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.300 
and it was also because like I say was
just<00:03:03.640> my<00:03:03.790> upper<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.470> sometimes<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.250> know

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
just my upper you so sometimes I I know

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.880 
just my upper you so sometimes I I know
that<00:03:06.700> when<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.270> have<00:03:07.480> both<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:08.140> your<00:03:08.380> job<00:03:08.620> is

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
that when you have both of your job is

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.100 
that when you have both of your job is
more<00:03:09.430> difficult<00:03:09.670> actually<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.600> means<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
more difficult actually it means to the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.570 
more difficult actually it means to the
lower<00:03:11.290> low<00:03:11.590> because<00:03:11.770> it's<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.190> one<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.520> we

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
lower low because it's the one that we

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.930 
lower low because it's the one that we
use<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.120> most
