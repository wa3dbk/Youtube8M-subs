we're dealing with airbags it's always a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.570 
we're dealing with airbags it's always a
good<00:00:18.900> idea<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.680> remove<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> negative

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

terminal<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> battery<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.430> very

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
terminal on the battery this is very

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
terminal on the battery this is very
important<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.630> don't<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.990> this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
important because if you don't do this

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.900 
important because if you don't do this
there<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> always<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.980> risk<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> airbag

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
there is always a risk of the airbag

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.019 
there is always a risk of the airbag
deploying<00:00:27.830> also<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:29.010> will<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.340> fault

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
deploying also there will be a fault

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
with you there you get into the bottom

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.670 
with you there you get into the bottom
there's<00:03:55.180> also<00:03:55.389> one<00:03:56.290> up<00:03:56.409> top<00:03:56.680> here<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:59.379> another

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
there's also one up top here and another

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.819 
there's also one up top here and another
right<00:04:00.219> over<00:04:00.430> there<00:04:00.609> so<00:04:01.180> loosen<00:04:01.689> those<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.199> you

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
right over there so loosen those and you

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.330 
right over there so loosen those and you
should<00:04:03.069> that<00:04:03.519> have<00:04:03.729> able<00:04:03.969> to<00:04:04.060> scowl<00:04:05.129> it<00:04:06.129> should

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
should that have able to scowl it should

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.029 
should that have able to scowl it should
be<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> little<00:04:06.699> bit<00:04:06.790> easier<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.239> remove<00:04:08.039> now

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:09.039 
be a little bit easier to remove now

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.709 
be a little bit easier to remove now
that<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.430> have<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.729> column<00:04:10.120> cowl<00:04:10.359> cover

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:10.719 
that you have the column cowl cover

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.649 
that you have the column cowl cover
removed<00:04:11.229> there's<00:04:12.189> a<00:04:12.340> single<00:04:12.819> clip<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:13.299> the

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
removed there's a single clip on the

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.909 
removed there's a single clip on the
bottom<00:04:13.959> here<00:04:14.259> and<00:04:14.969> there<00:04:15.969> are<00:04:16.120> two<00:04:16.560> up<00:04:17.560> top

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
bottom here and there are two up top

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.300 
bottom here and there are two up top
here<00:04:18.299> remove<00:04:19.299> those<00:04:19.620> mark<00:04:20.620> them<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.010> set<00:04:21.190> them

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
here remove those mark them and set them

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.420 
here remove those mark them and set them
aside<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.630> next<00:04:22.960> step<00:04:23.139> is<00:04:23.320> slightly<00:04:24.130> harder

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
aside the next step is slightly harder

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.040 
aside the next step is slightly harder
to<00:04:24.460> see<00:04:24.729> this<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
to see this is the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.980 
to see this is the
five<00:04:26.440> millimeter<00:04:26.979> hex<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:28.060> holds<00:04:28.509> the<00:04:28.629> entire

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
five millimeter hex it holds the entire

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.219 
five millimeter hex it holds the entire
clock<00:04:29.620> spring<00:04:29.979> on<00:04:30.690> I'm<00:04:31.690> using<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:32.020> long

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
clock spring on I'm using a long

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.170 
clock spring on I'm using a long
clearance<00:04:32.680> five<00:04:32.949> millimeter<00:04:33.400> here<00:04:33.639> up<00:04:33.849> in

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
clearance five millimeter here up in

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.629 
clearance five millimeter here up in
there<00:04:34.389> loosen<00:04:35.139> that<00:04:35.259> all<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.740> way<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.550> the

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
there loosen that all the way and the

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.119 
there loosen that all the way and the
clock<00:04:36.849> spring<00:04:37.060> should<00:04:37.360> just<00:04:37.629> come<00:04:37.810> right<00:04:38.020> off

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
clock spring should just come right off

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.930 
clock spring should just come right off
so<00:04:39.129> there<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.430> have<00:04:39.460> it

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
so there you have it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.469 
so there you have it
the<00:04:40.150> clock<00:04:40.389> spring<00:04:41.550> old<00:04:42.550> one<00:04:42.849> on<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.090> top<00:04:43.270> for

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
the clock spring old one on the top for

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.890 
the clock spring old one on the top for
me<00:04:43.599> new<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:43.960> on<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.169> bottom<00:04:45.750> installation<00:04:46.750> is

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
me new one on the bottom installation is

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.430 
me new one on the bottom installation is
a<00:04:46.930> reverse<00:04:47.289> of<00:04:47.530> removal<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.720> airbag<00:04:50.050> system

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
a reverse of removal the airbag system

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.379 
a reverse of removal the airbag system
automatically<00:04:51.069> relearn's<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.759> resets<00:04:52.150> so

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
automatically relearn's and resets so

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.210 
automatically relearn's and resets so
even<00:04:52.690> if<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.870> did<00:04:53.020> trip<00:04:53.259> a<00:04:53.349> fault<00:04:53.620> code<00:04:53.860> by

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
even if you did trip a fault code by

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.770 
even if you did trip a fault code by
doing<00:04:54.580> this<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:54.789> not<00:04:55.030> waiting<00:04:55.270> quite<00:04:55.539> long

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
doing this and not waiting quite long

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.189 
doing this and not waiting quite long
enough

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
enough

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.950 
enough
after<00:04:56.560> removing<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.039> battery<00:04:57.310> lead<00:04:57.960> after

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
after removing the battery lead after

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.450 
after removing the battery lead after
driving<00:04:59.259> three<00:04:59.620> or<00:04:59.710> four<00:04:59.889> days<00:05:00.069> it<00:05:00.310> should

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
driving three or four days it should

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.830 
driving three or four days it should
automatically<00:05:00.969> reset<00:05:02.759> after<00:05:03.759> reassembly<00:05:04.509> you

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
automatically reset after reassembly you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.409 
automatically reset after reassembly you
should<00:05:05.080> look<00:05:05.319> just<00:05:05.349> like<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:05.949> next<00:05:06.940> step<00:05:07.270> is

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
should look just like this next step is

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.390 
should look just like this next step is
to<00:05:07.539> plug<00:05:07.719> in<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.960> battery<00:05:08.110> try<00:05:09.069> everything

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
to plug in the battery try everything

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.420 
to plug in the battery try everything
out<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:09.819> just<00:05:10.060> see<00:05:10.750> if<00:05:10.780> that<00:05:10.960> helped<00:05:11.430> hope

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
out and just see if that helped hope

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.920 
out and just see if that helped hope
this<00:05:12.610> video<00:05:12.849> helped<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.060> out<00:05:13.150> somewhat<00:05:13.690> I

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
this video helped you out somewhat I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.719 
this video helped you out somewhat I
know<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.770> first<00:05:14.919> time<00:05:15.009> you<00:05:15.099> looked<00:05:15.310> at<00:05:15.400> airbag

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
know the first time you looked at airbag

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.249 
know the first time you looked at airbag
removal<00:05:16.240> was<00:05:16.330> kinda<00:05:16.569> hard<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.750> find<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:17.199> I

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
removal was kinda hard to find so I

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.140 
removal was kinda hard to find so I
figure<00:05:17.530> at<00:05:17.979> very<00:05:18.250> least<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.699> video<00:05:18.909> is<00:05:19.000> good

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
figure at very least the video is good

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.219 
figure at very least the video is good
enough<00:05:19.300> for<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.599> so<00:05:20.219> enjoy
