to<00:03:14.450> modify<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.230> great<00:03:16.389> so<00:03:17.389> they<00:03:18.079> sat<00:03:18.290> down<00:03:18.349> and

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
to modify it great so they sat down and

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.879 
to modify it great so they sat down and
as<00:03:19.519> these<00:03:20.180> guys<00:03:20.810> do<00:03:21.109> in<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.319> regiment<00:03:21.709> they

as these guys do in the regiment they

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.000 
as these guys do in the regiment they
have<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.129> plan<00:03:22.609> someone<00:03:23.449> has<00:03:23.810> an<00:03:23.930> idea<00:03:24.049> someone

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
have a plan someone has an idea someone

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.069 
have a plan someone has an idea someone
else<00:03:25.220> has<00:03:25.400> an<00:03:25.519> idea<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.419> they<00:03:26.629> worked<00:03:26.870> it

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
else has an idea and they worked it

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.240 
else has an idea and they worked it
together<00:03:27.199> producing<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:29.230> unit<00:03:30.230> made<00:03:30.409> G

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
together producing this unit made G

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.240 
together producing this unit made G
noticed<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.819> gun<00:03:32.319> carrying<00:03:33.319> which<00:03:33.829> carries

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
noticed the gun carrying which carries

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.830 
noticed the gun carrying which carries
the<00:03:34.280> SLR<00:03:34.849> quite<00:03:35.629> simple<00:03:36.139> easy<00:03:36.379> made<00:03:36.769> bent

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
the SLR quite simple easy made bent

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.539 
the SLR quite simple easy made bent
jerrycans<00:03:39.970> bolted<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.180> front<00:03:41.979> the<00:03:42.979> spare

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
jerrycans bolted to the front the spare

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.119 
jerrycans bolted to the front the spare
wheel<00:03:43.879> hanging<00:03:44.569> from<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.870> front<00:03:45.109> was<00:03:45.409> a<00:03:45.680> later

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
wheel hanging from the front was a later

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.409 
wheel hanging from the front was a later
modification<00:03:47.090> they<00:03:47.329> were<00:03:49.060> toying<00:03:50.060> with<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
modification they were toying with the

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.460 
modification they were toying with the
idea<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:52.489> eventually<00:03:53.479> it<00:03:53.569> did<00:03:53.720> end<00:03:54.079> up<00:03:54.260> on<00:03:54.409> the

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
idea and eventually it did end up on the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.599 
idea and eventually it did end up on the
front<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:54.799> this<00:03:54.979> is<00:03:55.099> quite<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.340> later

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
front so this is quite a later

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.640 
front so this is quite a later
modification<00:03:56.299> early<00:03:56.629> ones<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.229> spare<00:03:57.500> wheel

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
modification early ones the spare wheel

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.439 
modification early ones the spare wheel
stayed<00:03:57.949> on<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.250> top<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:59.180> when<00:03:59.299> you're

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
stayed on the top but when you're

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.339 
stayed on the top but when you're
dealing<00:03:59.659> with<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.989> 916<00:04:00.829> tire<00:04:01.639> it's<00:04:01.909> heavy<00:04:02.349> too

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
dealing with the 916 tire it's heavy too

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.170 
dealing with the 916 tire it's heavy too
heavy<00:04:03.379> for<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.889> bonnet<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.489> some<00:04:04.849> come<00:04:05.060> up

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
heavy for the bonnet so some come up

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.720 
heavy for the bonnet so some come up
with<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.359> idea<00:04:05.690> put<00:04:06.169> it<00:04:06.290> on<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:06.530> bumper<00:04:06.949> on

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
with the idea put it on the bumper on

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.960 
with the idea put it on the bumper on
in<00:04:07.849> front<00:04:08.500> they've<00:04:09.500> realized<00:04:10.099> then<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.580> that

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
in front they've realized then that that

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.710 
in front they've realized then that that
also<00:04:11.510> caused<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.230> stir<00:04:13.010> Amer<00:04:13.550> which<00:04:14.209> helped

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
also caused a stir Amer which helped

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.080 
also caused a stir Amer which helped
cool<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.170> vehicle<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.340> they've<00:04:16.700> done<00:04:16.910> that

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
cool the vehicle so they've done that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.390 
cool the vehicle so they've done that
they<00:04:17.690> also<00:04:17.870> had<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:18.320> modify<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.889> vehicle

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
they also had to modify the vehicle

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.120 
they also had to modify the vehicle
inside<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.720> fishermen<00:04:21.650> what<00:04:21.829> they've<00:04:21.980> done

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
inside to fishermen what they've done

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.740 
inside to fishermen what they've done
with<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> jeeps<00:04:22.610> with<00:04:22.820> an<00:04:22.970> expansion<00:04:23.540> tank

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
with the jeeps with an expansion tank

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.830 
with the jeeps with an expansion tank
which<00:04:23.960> went<00:04:24.200> inside<00:04:25.270> okay<00:04:26.270> here<00:04:26.479> we<00:04:26.570> have<00:04:26.720> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
which went inside okay here we have the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.909 
which went inside okay here we have the
GPMG<00:04:27.350> it's<00:04:27.740> on<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.950> early<00:04:28.310> gun<00:04:28.520> mount<00:04:29.919> which

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
GPMG it's on the early gun mount which

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.700 
GPMG it's on the early gun mount which
was<00:04:31.130> akin<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.669> Bren<00:04:32.110> from<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.290> earlier

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
was akin to the Bren from the earlier

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.170 
was akin to the Bren from the earlier
vehicles<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.479> Jeep's<00:04:35.750> era<00:04:36.729> very<00:04:37.729> simple

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
vehicles of the Jeep's era very simple

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.390 
vehicles of the Jeep's era very simple
setup<00:04:38.950> but<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.250> took<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.639> jim<00:04:41.270> p<00:04:42.160> without<00:04:43.160> any

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
setup but it took the jim p without any

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.000 
setup but it took the jim p without any
buffering<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.389> there<00:04:44.630> was<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.860> did

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
buffering and there was a so it did

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.890 
buffering and there was a so it did
shake<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.370> vehicle<00:04:46.760> bit<00:04:46.910> we<00:04:47.360> go<00:04:47.540> on<00:04:47.660> back

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
shake the vehicle bit we go on back

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.110 
shake the vehicle bit we go on back
through<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.320> vehicle<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.400> idea<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:49.940> the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
through the vehicle the idea of the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.500 
through the vehicle the idea of the
jerry<00:04:51.050> cans<00:04:51.320> having<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.710> be<00:04:51.860> thrown<00:04:52.280> off<00:04:52.510> under

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
jerry cans having to be thrown off under

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.320 
jerry cans having to be thrown off under
air<00:04:53.660> attack<00:04:53.690> have<00:04:54.440> now<00:04:54.650> come<00:04:54.950> into<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.970> being

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
air attack have now come into it being

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.860 
air attack have now come into it being
and<00:04:56.660> these<00:04:56.870> were<00:04:57.080> tied<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.100> side<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:59.810> is

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
and these were tied to the side this is

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.180 
and these were tied to the side this is
as<00:05:00.350> i<00:05:00.560> said<00:05:00.740> quite<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.580> later<00:05:02.110> modification<00:05:03.190> so

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
as i said quite a later modification so

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.270 
as i said quite a later modification so
it<00:05:04.490> was<00:05:05.060> becoming<00:05:05.479> more<00:05:05.660> akin<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.500> the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
it was becoming more akin to the

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.550 
it was becoming more akin to the
marshals<00:05:07.790> one

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.780 

okay<00:05:12.560> spotlight<00:05:13.040> here<00:05:13.490> we<00:05:13.580> have<00:05:13.700> the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
okay spotlight here we have the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.160 
okay spotlight here we have the
spotlight<00:05:14.030> which<00:05:14.450> is<00:05:14.600> good<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:14.960> catching

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
spotlight which is good for catching

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.750 
spotlight which is good for catching
rabbits<00:05:16.960> realizing<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.080> we<00:05:18.230> needed<00:05:18.470> more

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
rabbits realizing that we needed more

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.390 
rabbits realizing that we needed more
illumination<00:05:19.760> sometimes<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:21.440> dazzling<00:05:22.280> the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
illumination sometimes and dazzling the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.240 
illumination sometimes and dazzling the
enemy<00:05:22.700> it's<00:05:22.880> it's<00:05:23.150> it's<00:05:23.480> they've<00:05:24.010> found<00:05:25.010> out

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
enemy it's it's it's they've found out

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.920 
enemy it's it's it's they've found out
that<00:05:25.460> what<00:05:25.700> they<00:05:25.820> call<00:05:26.030> white<00:05:26.240> light<00:05:26.480> dazzle

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
that what they call white light dazzle

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.980 
that what they call white light dazzle
if<00:05:27.770> you've<00:05:27.920> got<00:05:28.360> enemy<00:05:29.360> that's<00:05:29.600> got<00:05:29.780> white

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
if you've got enemy that's got white

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.680 
if you've got enemy that's got white
light<00:05:30.200> shining<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.770> their<00:05:30.860> eyes<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:32.150> causes

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
light shining in their eyes it causes

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.530 
light shining in their eyes it causes
confusion<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.620> we<00:05:33.800> had<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.040> white<00:05:34.220> lights

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
confusion so we had the white lights
