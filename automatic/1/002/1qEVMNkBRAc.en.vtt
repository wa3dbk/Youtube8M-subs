the packaging it kind of looks like a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
the packaging it kind of looks like a
tissue<00:00:38.100> box<00:00:38.370> where<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.910> actually<00:00:39.210> peel<00:00:39.960> this

tissue box where you actually peel this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.799 
tissue box where you actually peel this
back<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.640> sheet<00:00:41.879> mat<00:00:42.059> has<00:00:42.270> come<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.629> like

back and the sheet mat has come out like
a<00:00:42.870> tissue<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> said<00:00:48.360> earlier<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a tissue so like I said earlier that

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.869 
a tissue so like I said earlier that
actually<00:00:49.620> initially<00:00:50.219> bought<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.610> sheet

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
actually initially bought these sheet

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.770 
actually initially bought these sheet
masks<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.510> mom<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:52.559> thought<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
masks on my mom I thought they could the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
masks on my mom I thought they could the
coenzyme<00:00:55.320> q-10<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.489> her<00:00:56.610> aging

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
coenzyme q-10 will be good for her aging

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
coenzyme q-10 will be good for her aging
skin<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.109> unfortunately<00:00:58.859> my<00:00:59.039> mom<00:00:59.250> has

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
skin but unfortunately my mom has

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.209 
skin but unfortunately my mom has
extremely<00:01:00.329> sensitive<00:01:00.960> skin<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:02.070> actually

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
extremely sensitive skin it actually

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
extremely sensitive skin it actually
calls<00:01:02.640> her<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.059> some<00:01:03.210> itching<00:01:03.629> around

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
calls her to have some itching around

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
calls her to have some itching around
her<00:01:04.049> eyes<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> decided<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> finish<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.610> up

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
her eyes so I decided to finish it up

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.770 
her eyes so I decided to finish it up
for<00:01:05.909> her<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.689> like

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
for her because I don't really like

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.410 
for her because I don't really like
wasting<00:01:07.260> beauty<00:01:07.500> products<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.150> those<00:01:09.240> who

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
wasting beauty products so for those who

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
wasting beauty products so for those who
are<00:01:09.479> unfamiliar<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.380> coenzyme<00:01:11.010> q10<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
are unfamiliar what coenzyme q10 is I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
are unfamiliar what coenzyme q10 is I
was<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.420> quickly<00:01:12.600> explain<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.320> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
was going to quickly explain what it is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.460 
was going to quickly explain what it is
so<00:01:14.250> coenzyme<00:01:14.820> q-10<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.390> chemical<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
so coenzyme q-10 is a chemical that is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
so coenzyme q-10 is a chemical that is
extremely<00:01:17.040> important<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:18.180> cellular

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
extremely important for cellular

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.410 
extremely important for cellular
function<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:20.100> helps<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.880> ATP

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
function it actually helps to make ATP

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.980 
function it actually helps to make ATP
which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.130> main<00:01:23.369> energy<00:01:24.060> source<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
which is the main energy source for the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980 
which is the main energy source for the
body<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> coenzyme<00:01:26.850> q10<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.479> also<00:01:27.869> an

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
body so coenzyme q10 is also an

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
body so coenzyme q10 is also an
antioxidant<00:01:29.270> antioxidants<00:01:30.270> helps<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
antioxidant antioxidants helps to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.600 
antioxidant antioxidants helps to
neutralize<00:01:30.810> free<00:01:31.110> radical<00:01:31.770> damage<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
neutralize free radical damage which is

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.890 
neutralize free radical damage which is
one<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> biggest<00:01:33.780> causes<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.409> Aging<00:01:35.900> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
one of the biggest causes of Aging so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.990 
one of the biggest causes of Aging so
naturally<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.860> body<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.790> have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
naturally in our body we do have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.899 
naturally in our body we do have
coenzyme<00:01:39.540> q10<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.680> through<00:01:41.130> various<00:01:41.460> factors

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
coenzyme q10 but through various factors

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.350 
coenzyme q10 but through various factors
such<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.450> increased<00:01:43.259> stress<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.009> even<00:01:44.670> aging

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
such as increased stress and even aging

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.530 
such as increased stress and even aging
these<00:01:45.869> levels<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.409> decrease<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> by

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
these levels actually decrease so by

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
these levels actually decrease so by
putting<00:01:48.930> something<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> sheet<00:01:50.040> mask

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
putting something on like a sheet mask

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
putting something on like a sheet mask
contains<00:01:51.350> coenzyme<00:01:52.350> q10<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.220> help<00:01:53.840> with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
contains coenzyme q10 it can help with

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.170 
contains coenzyme q10 it can help with
cellular<00:01:55.619> regeneration<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.670> cellular

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
cellular regeneration and cellular

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.800 
cellular regeneration and cellular
repair<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.310> overall<00:01:59.670> impression<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.420> these

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
repair so my overall impression of these

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
repair so my overall impression of these
masks<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.180> extremely

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
masks are that they are extremely

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.959 
masks are that they are extremely
affordable<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.860> them<00:02:05.070> at<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.700> good

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
affordable if you can get them at a good

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.260 
affordable if you can get them at a good
price

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
price

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.570 
price
like<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.840> satakam<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:09.500> $15<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.950> 26

19 but they didn't break me out which is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.670 
19 but they didn't break me out which is
something<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:36.299> good<00:02:37.109> on<00:02:37.230> my<00:02:37.379> part

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
something that is good on my part

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.380 
something that is good on my part
because<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.890> break<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> lot<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.060> things

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
because I break up to a lot of things

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.059 
because I break up to a lot of things
but<00:02:39.989> there<00:02:40.349> are<00:02:40.439> some<00:02:40.620> things<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:40.920> I

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
but there are some things that I

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.500 
but there are some things that I
actually<00:02:41.220> really<00:02:41.640> didn't<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.090> about<00:02:42.390> these

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
actually really didn't like about these

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.140 
actually really didn't like about these
masks<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.500> first<00:02:43.769> thing<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.519> packaging

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
masks the first thing is the packaging

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.849 
masks the first thing is the packaging
so<00:02:45.480> when<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> first<00:02:45.930> bought<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.530> thought<00:02:46.739> it

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
so when I first bought it I thought it

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.069 
so when I first bought it I thought it
would<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.040> such<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:47.639> convenient<00:02:48.150> design<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
would be such a convenient design that

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.289 
would be such a convenient design that
you<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.379> kind<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.650> pop<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.519> top<00:02:50.730> open<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
you just kind of pop the top open and

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.990 
you just kind of pop the top open and
just<00:02:51.540> take<00:02:51.810> off<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.170> sheet<00:02:52.349> mask<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.430> because

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
just take off the sheet mask but because

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.940 
just take off the sheet mask but because
there's<00:02:54.209> 2006<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:55.319> not<00:02:55.560> the
