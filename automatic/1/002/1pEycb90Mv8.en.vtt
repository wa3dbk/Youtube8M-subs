00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.809
 so here we started by mounting the processor 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.560
 but play with foot and fear because you have a tree 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.189
 so I'll take out the blue card 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.789
 the people 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.869
 in all that is waiting for you indeed his bills to see what you're going 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 see soon did not want 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 so I went back at the end of the season 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 and allegiance to al-qaeda over these fucking 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 Why 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.150
 while 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 that's why it's a success 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.620
 in this location 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.900
 you are a big step to remove the tackle thanks to the processor 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.230
 on the form 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 then I will be delighted 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 your favorite 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.460
 so there we wait a lot 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.270
 this is the talent of his actors 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 england 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 the processors lyonnais site 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 while we were proscribed 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.790
 is removed 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 Cemetery 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 for the couple anything on the court 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.080
 we hide it 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.400
 and in fact very much only one 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.900
 the 8000 156 heating ping in itself 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160
 ruggiero inch processor 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.500
 any 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 so to find ourselves out 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.789
 on one side of that google tv 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.619
 according to 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.769
 thermal paste 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.040
 4 how consists of a processor so that if you have to see it here 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.299
 racing 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.939
 for the bridge 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.519
 what is the on-site storage 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.519
 if we do not believe in this season 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.299
 so far 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.499
 I add that compensation on both sides 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.499
 the repertoire where that playing very complete 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.549
 so a processor 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.619
 we will continue to decline 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.619
 odilon redon 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
 for rapeseed 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.359
 in the project 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.359
 at the end 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.759
 and optics 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.319
 you have to worry 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.999
 he also promised that if he will be there 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.689
 where he follows the surface 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.689
 its design is even a little 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.599
 for all those who do not like it 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.039
 here 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.039
 then - not the ventirad 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.189
 when south a conclusive journey is a way of being 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.849
 m 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.549
 so 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 the action 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.249
 or what I want to clog the forearm - well I'm here 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.169
 for now I'm enjoying here 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.590
 by his success 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.680
 what makes me feel better we understand the group is a sum 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.229
 so a source 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.860
 poussines 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
 where he lives 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.879
 but what are we waiting for 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.330
 however, he told himself 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
 both problems 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.409
 under the seal of a woman 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.009
 for this guy 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 as to the world 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.099
 that's why I'm trial again on the problem 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.309
 a little chaotic 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.039
 here is the group will be found
