00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.309
 show the mojo de rovio angry birds 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.559
 epic is called and it's a different game than 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.059
 what we are used to 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.949
 difference from the previous thanks of 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.210
 races but good they changed again 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.310
 ordered to do something totally new 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 how will they see the tc face of the world so 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 seen is bigger obviously here is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.630
 new will be dissipating will appear 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.449
 more things of the course that will be the wrath of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.760
 the pigs are then good here 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.909
 I have different levels this will come in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.089
 this and it's a turn-based game this is a 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.670
 game really very different to the years 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.229
 previous then in this case I am 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.210
 this bird then let's do other 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.149
 and we are going to even do several to the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.550
 time and here we have the pig then my 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 turn to attack and he plays the turn to 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.020
 champions 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.310
 we have different armours of mine like 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.980
 from the pigs to nobody being 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.930
 different drawings graphics 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.900
 they are really very good in the style of 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.580
 tuna everton of the pigs there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.860
 a lot of variety of pork to things 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 I like that I kept quiet 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 really with very cute of this drawings 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 and animations I really liked that and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 well let's go have different 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.300
 powers to choose good armor from 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.370
 all a little 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.090
 at least it has gone down a little rovio 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.390
 in the type of game your franchise of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.500
 angry birds is something a little different 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.990
 but it really seems like a game 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.910
 interesting when you're in the app store 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.720
 it's going to be a free game and it's going to have 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.590
 Obviously you buy in app and for example 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.620
 here rescued chat and good since it 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.030
 finished ordering the little pigs like that 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.280
 how good we have the three stars 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.590
 that's oxygen has not changed if you have 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.640
 changed this and a roulette and to have 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.490
 good luck to see if they touch us three 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 Equalities than evolution but good is 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.440
 a different game of angry birds and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.820
 Well worth it to try it when 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.250
 be in the app stores is going to be free 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.320
 so it's not going to cost anything to prove it 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.880
 and well there is not much more to show is 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.370
 simply that the game a game by 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.150
 shifts so I hope that you give them 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.720

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.330
 If it seems boring , it seems that 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.760
 they are bored
