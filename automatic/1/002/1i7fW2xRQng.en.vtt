00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590 

this<00:00:00.659> location<00:00:01.170> right<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.770> about<00:00:02.600> eight

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
this location right here is about eight

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.470 
this location right here is about eight
million<00:00:04.049> meters<00:00:04.950> away<00:00:05.220> from<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.670> origin<00:00:06.029> away

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
million meters away from the origin away

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.180 
million meters away from the origin away
from<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.960> sort<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.379> starting<00:00:07.740> location<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.719> I

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
from the sort of starting location and I

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.290 
from the sort of starting location and I
thought<00:00:11.190> I'd<00:00:11.340> show<00:00:11.519> some<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> problems

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
thought I'd show some of the problems

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.730 
thought I'd show some of the problems
with<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.599> like<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.139> look<00:00:13.259> around<00:00:13.530> just

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
with this like you can look around just

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.150 
with this like you can look around just
fine<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.089> about<00:00:15.120> eight<00:00:15.480> million<00:00:15.690> meters

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
fine but at about eight million meters

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.140 
fine but at about eight million meters
you're<00:00:17.160> kinda<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> limits<00:00:18.029> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
you're kinda at the limits of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.769 
you're kinda at the limits of
playability<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.920> go<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> direction

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
playability so if I go in this direction

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.340 
playability so if I go in this direction
everything's<00:00:21.779> fine

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
everything's fine

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.609 
everything's fine
it's<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.070> bad<00:00:24.080> if<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.500> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it's not so bad if I go in this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.790 
it's not so bad if I go in this
direction<00:00:25.849> however<00:00:27.140> things<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.289> really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
direction however things are really

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
direction however things are really
jerky<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.029> because<00:00:30.240> I've<00:00:30.330> gone<00:00:30.420> eight

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
jerky and it's because I've gone eight

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.200 
jerky and it's because I've gone eight
million<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:32.130> direction<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:32.969> X

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
million in one direction like an X

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.319 
million in one direction like an X
instead<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.750> Z<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.110> whatever<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.520> by

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
instead of Z or whatever and so by

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.090 
instead of Z or whatever and so by
moving<00:00:36.690> along<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> x<00:00:37.410> direction<00:00:37.710> where<00:00:38.010> I'm

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
moving along the x direction where I'm

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.250 
moving along the x direction where I'm
jumping<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.790> eight<00:00:39.540> million<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.110> eight

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
jumping from eight million to eight

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.780 
jumping from eight million to eight
million<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.700> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
million in one and so on you get this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.810 
million in one and so on you get this
really<00:00:42.000> jerky<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
really jerky kind of look to it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
really jerky kind of look to it
like<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.360> say<00:00:45.539> though<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> Z<00:00:46.110> value<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.500> like

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
like I say though the Z value is like

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.240 
like I say though the Z value is like
zero<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.879> moving<00:00:48.149> back<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> forth<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.870> Z

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
zero so just moving back and forth and Z

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.910 
zero so just moving back and forth and Z
doesn't<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.520> weird<00:00:51.500> however<00:00:52.500> you'll

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
doesn't get so weird however you'll

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
doesn't get so weird however you'll
notice<00:00:53.070> another<00:00:53.489> interesting<00:00:54.000> error<00:00:54.210> which

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
notice another interesting error which

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.270 
notice another interesting error which
is<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:56.219> due<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> X<00:00:56.850> precision<00:00:58.039> being<00:00:59.039> off

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
is that due to the X precision being off

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
is that due to the X precision being off
there's<00:01:00.059> something<00:01:00.359> funky<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.109> with

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
there's something funky going on with

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.850 
there's something funky going on with
the<00:01:01.379> torture<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.140> move<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the torture so like if I if I move and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.320 
the torture so like if I if I move and
in<00:01:05.129> fact<00:01:05.309> what's<00:01:05.489> interesting<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.180> I'm

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
in fact what's interesting here is I'm

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
in fact what's interesting here is I'm
moving<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.320> tiny<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> quick

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
moving just a little tiny like a quick

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.690 
moving just a little tiny like a quick
click<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> left<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.590> makes<00:01:11.520> me

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
click to the left or right it makes me

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
click to the left or right it makes me
jump<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:12.689> move<00:01:13.080> smoothly<00:01:13.530> from

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
jump actually I don't move smoothly from

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
jump actually I don't move smoothly from
left<00:01:14.040> right<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> whole<00:01:14.729> jumpiness<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
left right there's a whole jumpiness to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
left right there's a whole jumpiness to
it<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.990> anyway<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> torch<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it but anyway look at the torch as I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
it but anyway look at the torch as I
move<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.750> I'll<00:01:18.869> take<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
move here I'll take it from here this is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
move here I'll take it from here this is
actually<00:01:20.369> even<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.549> convincing<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
actually even more convincing that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
actually even more convincing that
something<00:01:21.750> weirds<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> torch

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
something weirds going on so the torch

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.350 
something weirds going on so the torch
top<00:01:24.080> is<00:01:25.080> moving<00:01:25.409> around<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.030> well

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
top is moving around and it's just well

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
top is moving around and it's just well
off<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.900> basically<00:01:28.850> if<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.939> move<00:01:30.150> over<00:01:30.920> its

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
off of it basically if I move over its

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
off of it basically if I move over its
sort<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> does<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> strange<00:01:33.150> alignment<00:01:33.600> kind

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
sort of does the strange alignment kind

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
sort of does the strange alignment kind
of<00:01:33.810> jumping<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.610> thing<00:01:35.759> you'll

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
of jumping so the other thing you'll

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
of jumping so the other thing you'll
notice<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.680> when<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:38.009> try<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
notice is that when I actually try to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.289 
notice is that when I actually try to
highlight<00:01:38.759> some<00:01:39.090> area<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:40.259> again<00:01:40.650> jumped

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
highlight some area it's again jumped

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.050 
highlight some area it's again jumped
some<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.420> portion<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> am<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.880> about

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
some one portion so here I am at about

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.469 
some one portion so here I am at about
six<00:01:48.509> million<00:01:51.020> away<00:01:52.020> from<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> origin<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.180> X

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
six million away from the origin and X

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.469 
six million away from the origin and X
and<00:01:54.840> six<00:01:55.470> million<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.920> Z<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.369> both<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.909> both

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and six million in Z so both of both

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.530 
and six million in Z so both of both
directions<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.350> changing<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> lot<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.540> no

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
directions now I'm changing a lot and no

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.910 
directions now I'm changing a lot and no
surprise<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.530> things<00:02:01.770> are

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
surprise you can see that things are

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
surprise you can see that things are
pretty<00:02:02.159> misaligned<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
pretty misaligned you know you know in a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
pretty misaligned you know you know in a
number<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.899> ways<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.250> kind<00:02:08.550> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
number of ways like it's it's kind of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.160 
number of ways like it's it's kind of
funky<00:02:08.910> how<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> works<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.660> there's<00:02:09.989> sort

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
funky how it works actually there's sort

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.869 
funky how it works actually there's sort
of<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> sometimes<00:02:11.069> you'll<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.489> offset

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
of a sometimes you'll be offset

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
of a sometimes you'll be offset
sometimes<00:02:12.360> you'll<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.569> semi<00:02:12.959> aligned<00:02:13.319> with

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
sometimes you'll be semi aligned with

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
sometimes you'll be semi aligned with
one<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.800> them<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:15.450> anyway<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.100> here<00:02:17.490> here

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
one of them but anyway so here here

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.640 
one of them but anyway so here here
things<00:02:18.300> are<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.540> sort<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.140> horrific<00:02:19.350> no

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
things are just sort of horrific no

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.170 
things are just sort of horrific no
matter<00:02:19.800> how<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.010> move<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:21.060> this

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
matter how you move you just get this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.730 
matter how you move you just get this
big<00:02:21.660> jump<00:02:21.959> thing<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.100> time<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
big jump thing going on all the time and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.380 
big jump thing going on all the time and
I<00:02:25.740> found<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.220> if<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> about<00:02:27.120> 9

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
I found that if you go to about 9

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.470 
I found that if you go to about 9
million<00:02:27.660> meters<00:02:28.319> you'll<00:02:29.220> you'll<00:02:30.090> start<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
million meters you'll you'll start to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.750 
million meters you'll you'll start to
get<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.810> place<00:02:31.050> where<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.160> auto-saves

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
get in a place where it just auto-saves

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.570 
get in a place where it just auto-saves
all<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> time<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.900> some<00:02:34.020> reason<00:02:34.580> however

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
all the time for some reason however

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.670 
all the time for some reason however
notches<00:02:35.910> system<00:02:36.750> works<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.080> sort<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.319> decides

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
notches system works it sort of decides

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.640 
notches system works it sort of decides
that<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.790> need<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> save<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.450> file<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.110> it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that you need to save the file and it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
that you need to save the file and it
just<00:02:40.830> keeps<00:02:41.040> constantly<00:02:41.670> saving<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.180> chunky

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
just keeps constantly saving that chunky

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.780 
just keeps constantly saving that chunky
and<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.110> guess<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> surrounding<00:02:43.800> chunks<00:02:44.130> again

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
and I guess the surrounding chunks again

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.130 
and I guess the surrounding chunks again
and<00:02:44.940> again<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.239> again<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.630> basically<00:02:45.959> it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and again and again and basically it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.920 
and again and again and basically it
becomes<00:02:46.410> unplayable<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.570> kind<00:02:48.840> of

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
becomes unplayable so this is kind of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.440 
becomes unplayable so this is kind of
the<00:02:49.050> limits<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:50.280> how<00:02:50.459> far<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.850> can<00:02:50.940> really<00:02:51.269> go

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the limits of how far you can really go

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.370 
the limits of how far you can really go
so<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.170> think<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:53.010> maybe<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.430> circle<00:02:53.880> around

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
so I think that maybe a circle around

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.650 
so I think that maybe a circle around
you<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> radius<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.120> about<00:02:57.209> 8

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
you know with a radius of about 8

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.479 
you know with a radius of about 8
million<00:02:57.900> meters<00:02:58.380> which<00:02:58.980> sounds<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> lot

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
million meters which sounds like a lot

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.670 
million meters which sounds like a lot
but<00:02:59.819> that's<00:02:59.910> only<00:03:00.090> 8,000<00:03:00.840> kilometers<00:03:00.989> which

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
but that's only 8,000 kilometers which

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.630 
but that's only 8,000 kilometers which
is<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.880> know<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.300> conceivable<00:03:04.200> distance<00:03:04.650> it's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
is you know a conceivable distance it's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.280 
is you know a conceivable distance it's
you<00:03:05.790> know<00:03:05.880> what<00:03:06.120> 5,000<00:03:06.780> miles<00:03:06.930> or<00:03:07.200> something

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
you know what 5,000 miles or something

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.630 
you know what 5,000 miles or something
so<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.220> claims<00:03:11.489> that

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so it's a you know the the claims that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.809 
so it's a you know the the claims that
we<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> surface<00:03:13.650> area<00:03:13.950> 8<00:03:14.220> times<00:03:14.519> the

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
we can have a surface area 8 times the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.420 
we can have a surface area 8 times the
size<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.720> earth<00:03:15.750> well<00:03:16.680> that's<00:03:17.130> true

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
size of the earth well that's true

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.370 
size of the earth well that's true
enough<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.940> numbers<00:03:18.239> are<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.510> there<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.989> if

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
enough the numbers are all there but if

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.509 
enough the numbers are all there but if
you<00:03:19.530> actually<00:03:19.650> try<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.920> go<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> any<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.430> those

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
you actually try to go to any of those

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.539 
you actually try to go to any of those
places<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.329> get<00:03:21.480> crashes<00:03:21.930> at<00:03:22.590> like<00:03:22.860> 9

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
places you just get crashes at like 9

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.860 
places you just get crashes at like 9
million<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.090> found<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.420> start<00:03:24.660> getting

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
million I found you start getting

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.530 
million I found you start getting
crashes<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:25.709> anyway<00:03:26.579> not<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> big<00:03:27.150> deal

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540

no one's ever going to get more than a

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
thousand away from the origin anyway but

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.860 
thousand away from the origin anyway but
once<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.940> start<00:03:33.180> getting<00:03:33.269> up<00:03:33.510> into<00:03:33.780> these

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
once you start getting up into these

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.229 
once you start getting up into these
eight<00:03:34.140> million<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:34.860> on<00:03:35.010> areas<00:03:35.340> things<00:03:36.000> get

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
eight million and so on areas things get

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.170 
eight million and so on areas things get
very<00:03:36.450> very<00:03:36.840> strange
