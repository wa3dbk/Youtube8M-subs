00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

this<00:00:00.269> is<00:00:00.420> the<00:00:00.539> boomerang<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.199> great<00:00:01.680> plane

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
this is the boomerang a great plane

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.619 
this is the boomerang a great plane
because<00:00:02.310> of<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.520> number<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:02.939> flight<00:00:03.360> paths

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
because of a number of flight paths

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.210 
because of a number of flight paths
available<00:00:03.990> it<00:00:04.380> will<00:00:04.470> circle<00:00:04.830> back<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.130> you

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
available it will circle back to you

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.700 
available it will circle back to you
right<00:00:05.400> circle<00:00:05.879> back<00:00:06.029> left<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> single<00:00:07.379> loop

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
right circle back left do a single loop

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.070 
right circle back left do a single loop
and<00:00:07.919> outdoors<00:00:08.519> it'll<00:00:08.880> actually<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> double

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
and outdoors it'll actually do a double

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.570 
and outdoors it'll actually do a double
loop<00:00:10.260> flight<00:00:10.530> pattern<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.490> great

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
loop flight pattern so it's a great

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.700 
loop flight pattern so it's a great
indoor/outdoor<00:00:12.210> stunt<00:00:12.960> plane<00:00:13.170> we'll<00:00:13.410> start

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
indoor/outdoor stunt plane we'll start

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
indoor/outdoor stunt plane we'll start
by<00:00:13.889> folding<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> page<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.730> half<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.150> will

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
by folding the page in half that will

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.180 
by folding the page in half that will
make<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> pinch<00:00:15.929> fold<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.470> creased<00:00:16.890> side

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
make a pinch fold on the creased side

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.040 
make a pinch fold on the creased side
and<00:00:17.490> now<00:00:17.699> we'll<00:00:17.880> find<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.449> quarter<00:00:18.840> mark

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and now we'll find the one quarter mark

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.630 
and now we'll find the one quarter mark
of<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> crease<00:00:19.500> side<00:00:19.770> making<00:00:20.039> another<00:00:20.340> pinch

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
of the crease side making another pinch

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880 
of the crease side making another pinch
fold<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:21.180> we'll<00:00:21.359> fold<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.170> last<00:00:22.500> pinch

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
fold now we'll fold from that last pinch

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.980 
fold now we'll fold from that last pinch
mark<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.670> rock<00:00:23.939> corner<00:00:24.330> moving<00:00:24.720> both

mark to this rock corner moving both

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.960 
mark to this rock corner moving both
layers<00:00:25.289> over<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.920> will<00:00:26.070> unfold<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.670> crease

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
layers over now will unfold that crease

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
layers over now will unfold that crease
and<00:00:27.210> now<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.660> squash<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.380> pocket<00:00:28.740> flat<00:00:28.980> now

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and now will squash the pocket flat now

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.890 
and now will squash the pocket flat now
we'll<00:00:29.400> flip<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> model<00:00:29.880> over<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.539> we'll<00:00:30.720> fold

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
we'll flip the model over now we'll fold

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
we'll flip the model over now we'll fold
just<00:00:31.199> half<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> squash<00:00:31.980> fold<00:00:32.250> pocket<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
of an inch you don't have to measure

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
of an inch you don't have to measure
this<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.590> leave<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> space<00:00:44.520> at

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this just leave a little bit of space at

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.920 
this just leave a little bit of space at
the<00:00:44.760> bottom<00:00:44.969> between<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> point<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the bottom between the point of this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510 
the bottom between the point of this
corner<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> point<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> pocket<00:00:47.309> now

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
corner and the point of the pocket now

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.680 
corner and the point of the pocket now
we're<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> create<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.180> crease<00:00:48.450> that's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we're going to create a crease that's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.299 
we're going to create a crease that's
parallel<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> pocket<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.250> here

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
parallel with this pocket right here

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
parallel with this pocket right here
we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.329> put<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.660> corner

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
we're going to actually put this corner

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.420 
we're going to actually put this corner
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> pocket<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.829> making<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.190> crease

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
in the pocket so we're making a crease

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
in the pocket so we're making a crease
in<00:00:53.610> preparation<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.270> doing<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.020> layers

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in preparation for doing that the layers

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.900 
in preparation for doing that the layers
are<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> warp<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.460> don't<00:00:56.640> worry

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
are going to warp on you but don't worry

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.340 
are going to warp on you but don't worry
about<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.840> squashed<00:00:58.140> flat

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
about that will get them squashed flat

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.660 
about that will get them squashed flat
in<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> minute<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.010> you'll<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.550> more

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
in a minute now you'll see some more

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
in a minute now you'll see some more
warping<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> paper<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.350> lift<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
warping of the paper as we lift this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
warping of the paper as we lift this
corner<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.430> bend<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> pocket

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
corner and bend it into the pocket

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.600 
corner and bend it into the pocket
carefully<00:01:04.409> stuff<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> there

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
carefully stuff it all the way in there

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.250 
carefully stuff it all the way in there
so<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> bottom<00:01:06.540> squash

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
so it's right down on the bottom squash

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
so it's right down on the bottom squash
all<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> layers<00:01:07.770> flat<00:01:08.159> creating<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.790> new

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
all the layers flat creating two new

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
all the layers flat creating two new
creases<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.570> we'll<00:01:09.720> flip<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> model<00:01:10.170> over

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
creases now we'll flip the model over

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
creases now we'll flip the model over
and<00:01:10.770> repeat<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> whole<00:01:11.400> process<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:12.030> getting

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and repeat the whole process of getting

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.480 
and repeat the whole process of getting
this<00:01:12.540> corner<00:01:12.960> into<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> pocket

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
this corner into the pocket

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.700 
this corner into the pocket
now<00:01:16.150> we're<00:01:16.299> going<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.509> fold<00:01:16.720> this<00:01:16.990> flap<00:01:17.049> up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
now we're going to fold this flap up

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.560 
now we're going to fold this flap up
using<00:01:18.159> these<00:01:18.430> two<00:01:18.640> corners<00:01:19.000> as<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.270> limits

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
using these two corners as the limits

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.660 
using these two corners as the limits
and<00:01:19.720> we'll<00:01:20.649> flip<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.950> model<00:01:21.070> over<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.430> do<00:01:21.579> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
and we'll flip the model over and do the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.310 
and we'll flip the model over and do the
same<00:01:21.880> thing<00:01:22.149> for<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.360> other<00:01:22.420> side<00:01:22.810> now<00:01:23.140> we'll

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
same thing for the other side now we'll

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.050 
same thing for the other side now we'll
open<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.830> whole<00:01:24.040> model<00:01:24.430> up<00:01:24.610> along<00:01:24.939> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
open the whole model up along the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.969 
open the whole model up along the
fuselage<00:01:25.479> crease<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.049> we'll<00:01:26.409> have<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.649> squash

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
fuselage crease and we'll have to squash

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.889 
fuselage crease and we'll have to squash
these<00:01:27.310> layers<00:01:27.670> flat<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.270> now<00:01:28.420> we'll<00:01:28.600> bend<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
these layers flat and now we'll bend the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.450 
these layers flat and now we'll bend the
point<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.289> nose<00:01:29.470> down<00:01:29.799> toward<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.250> rear

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
point of the nose down toward the rear

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.850 
point of the nose down toward the rear
using<00:01:31.090> these<00:01:31.360> two<00:01:31.659> layers<00:01:31.899> as<00:01:32.170> guides<00:01:32.530> now

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
using these two layers as guides now

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.440 
using these two layers as guides now
we'll<00:01:33.009> make<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.159> fuselage<00:01:33.700> fold<00:01:33.970> once<00:01:34.210> again

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
we'll make a fuselage fold once again

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.090 
we'll make a fuselage fold once again
that<00:01:34.720> will<00:01:34.780> make<00:01:34.929> a<00:01:34.960> wing<00:01:35.200> crease<00:01:35.500> parallel

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
that will make a wing crease parallel

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.560 
that will make a wing crease parallel
with<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.280> fuselage<00:01:36.789> fold<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:37.270> about<00:01:37.390> an

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
with the fuselage fold it's about an

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.120 
with the fuselage fold it's about an
inch<00:01:37.780> thick<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.259> we'll<00:01:38.530> flip<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:38.799> model<00:01:38.920> over

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
inch thick and we'll flip the model over

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.469 
inch thick and we'll flip the model over
and<00:01:39.340> do<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.490> same<00:01:39.640> thing<00:01:39.880> for<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.090> other<00:01:40.149> side

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
and do the same thing for the other side

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.910 
and do the same thing for the other side
now<00:01:40.840> all<00:01:40.990> we<00:01:41.110> need<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.259> do<00:01:41.439> is<00:01:41.560> make<00:01:41.740> some

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
now all we need to do is make some

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.740 
now all we need to do is make some
winglets<00:01:42.280> these<00:01:42.729> winglets<00:01:42.970> are<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.270> bit<00:01:43.479> taller

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
winglets these winglets are a bit taller

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.240 
winglets these winglets are a bit taller
than<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.020> average<00:01:44.049> winglet<00:01:44.649> I'd<00:01:44.830> say<00:01:45.039> they're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
than the average winglet I'd say they're

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.830 
than the average winglet I'd say they're
a<00:01:45.399> little<00:01:45.580> more<00:01:45.789> than<00:01:45.820> an<00:01:46.000> inch<00:01:46.149> tall<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.659> of

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
a little more than an inch tall and of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.180 
a little more than an inch tall and of
course<00:01:47.049> will<00:01:47.200> repeat<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.619> winglet<00:01:47.890> procedure

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
course will repeat the winglet procedure

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.620 
course will repeat the winglet procedure
for<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.429> other<00:01:48.490> side<00:01:48.789> you<00:01:49.119> may<00:01:49.240> want<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.450> add<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
for the other side you may want to add a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600 
for the other side you may want to add a
bit<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:49.929> up<00:01:50.200> elevator<00:01:50.679> for<00:01:50.890> tighter<00:01:51.100> circles

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
bit of up elevator for tighter circles

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.969 
bit of up elevator for tighter circles
you<00:01:52.179> can<00:01:52.209> also<00:01:52.569> add<00:01:52.899> taller<00:01:53.229> winglets<00:01:53.860> and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
you can also add taller winglets and

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.440 
you can also add taller winglets and
that<00:01:54.280> will<00:01:54.459> cause<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.789> plane<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.030> circle

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
that will cause the plane to circle

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.059 
that will cause the plane to circle
tighter<00:01:55.659> as<00:01:55.810> well<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.380> plane<00:01:56.619> has<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.830> tendency

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
tighter as well the plane has a tendency

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.279 
tighter as well the plane has a tendency
to<00:01:57.250> droop<00:01:57.549> open<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.149> have<00:01:58.299> actually<00:01:58.810> negative

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
to droop open and have actually negative

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.499 
to droop open and have actually negative
dihedral<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.830> flight<00:02:00.069> that's<00:02:00.610> okay<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.240> flies

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
dihedral in flight that's okay it flies

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.690 
dihedral in flight that's okay it flies
just<00:02:01.539> fine<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:02.409> way<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.860> fact<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.610> can

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
just fine that way in fact you can

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.309 
just fine that way in fact you can
actually<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.299> bit<00:02:04.539> of<00:02:04.569> negative<00:02:04.810> dihedral

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
actually have a bit of negative dihedral

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.610 
actually have a bit of negative dihedral
as<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.799> sits<00:02:06.009> there<00:02:06.190> in<00:02:06.310> your<00:02:06.399> hand
