 21st edition of the jumping of cork they in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.050
 are for their expense since after a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.559
 year of absence the competition is good 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 return 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.950
 its organizers have moreover 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 presented the major trends of this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 vintage 2014 to the representatives of the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 press 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.940
 the beautiful setting of the provincial palace 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.850
 of cork a year of interruption 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 but hey it was a lot of fun 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 able to put the contest back on 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.699
 we had a huge success we feel 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.220
 that there were many expectations for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 the event that was missing the quadrilles 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.840
 was sad 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.609
 disappointed and angry at these dramas and sent a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.530
 nice reaction this year 

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:10.329
 it works from the craze already on the side 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.429
 from the public but also from the 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.740
 jumpers starting with the number 1 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.299
 Belgian even had there was the same 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.420
 time in parallel the world cup to 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.650
 lyon 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.119
 I immediately confirmed my 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.650
 participation problem until for me 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.820
 it's unthinkable not to be there 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.979
 there are many good riders 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.140
