00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.549 
said this in another videos everyone on
black<00:00:40.270> up<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.600> ten<00:00:41.020> times<00:00:41.289> better<00:00:41.469> than

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
black up to a ten times better than

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.020 
black up to a ten times better than
people<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:41.829> advanced<00:00:42.039> warfare<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.609> I<00:00:42.879> think

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
people in advanced warfare and I think

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.430 
people in advanced warfare and I think
that's<00:00:43.149> maybe<00:00:43.269> purely<00:00:43.690> because<00:00:43.809> people<00:00:44.230> had

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
that's maybe purely because people had

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.069 
that's maybe purely because people had
more<00:00:44.620> time<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:45.070> kind<00:00:45.250> of<00:00:45.309> play<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.059> game<00:00:46.239> and

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
more time to kind of play the game and

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.349 
more time to kind of play the game and
get<00:00:47.260> good<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.559> but<00:00:48.070> just<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.670> seems<00:00:48.879> that<00:00:49.090> the

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
get good it but just it seems that the

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.119
