00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi good girls on this video you will not see late to my 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.150
 face will not see me 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.130
 It's just a video to show you how beauties of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.290
 eyeshadow or mac at home so that's because you want them 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.629
 arrange in a palette 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.070
 or in europe and as I'm going to say because it's a landing at the same time 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.820
 so to retrieve the packaging to make the boat 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.439
 now that is to say that for its packaging 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.249
 per 100 m for which you will find the notion of heritage on the 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.369
 packing carton that we wanted to buy 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.990
 to dance the plastic packaging that must be brought back by annecy cinema 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.289
 that you are entitled to the free lip of your choice 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.170
 so the word to denounce 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.690
 I used 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.980
 for its part in this parchment paper so it is not all powerful 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 and not this one 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.830
 % with very very strong points of view pointing party 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.460
 alas not pass some take high school so I 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 prefer to pass it 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 how to go about it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.460
 so in 2003 the dotted eyelid 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 the first thing I'm going to do is I'm not going out 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 the eyeshadow of the building itself 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.950
 and for that you have to go to the level of employment etc 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.480
 here for now not so if 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.260
 you have to lift the bowl 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.850
 at the level of the left 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.680
 being very careful not to skid on the border with niger 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.359
 the tip of the knife a pedestrian crossing 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.969
 so in fact to avoid on things - young Poitiers not everything says of 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.020
 close like this 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 you attend most in the province and by an eyeshadow 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.170
 and so 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 jaffer lever 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.530
 until anyway 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 the base is carried away 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.310
 not yet quite accessible - 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.470
 and I push 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.450
 There you go 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.500
 and so the goal 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 it is to release its console light from the rest of the case 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.409
 at its head paris 22 that is to say the question is not topical yes 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.740
 your entire share 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.890
 my sides only on this plastic part in the dim light not especially 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.010
 the case so it must already disengaged it's from 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.829
 So now it's in good shape, it's not a burden 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.280
 so what I do now I take my parchment paper I liked 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.399
 my fort to nanterre of fall I cover 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:28.010
 back in plastic and I love by ap my father went through bordeaux 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 for a few seconds 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.069
 so why do I put some parchment paper it's for simply 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.079
 indicated that the plastic way to pass is that 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.079
 I galley let's get up if we still manage to remove it 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.959
 he's a trap rapper 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.299
 several factors come into play video of each other a work plan but also 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.109
 at the same time 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.410
 these matters too 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.529
 this plastic so 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.969
 to avoid 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.419
 the whole thing screw up at the same time 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
 I could not share 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.969
 so I pressed I waited quietly so very very very 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.749
 intense now at that level not to burn because they know 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.749
 they are looking for the lighthouse it's super hot 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.969
 I take advantage I recover 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.499
 I am sorry 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.429
 t 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.009
 I learn with the motherland to avoid burning me 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.509
 and I try to push to the top and you see 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.689
 the end 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.239
 and especially those at gifi heated up and now to finish 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.719
 I do not even take the one that comes 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.909
 and young shoots 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.749
 to take off the remaining glue 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.539
 and then that's your favor 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:42.849
 and listened 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.079
 now I hope of course cool in a few minutes 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.299
 after the war it is sufficient for your necklace needs a clear mandates 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.429
 if you need compared to the palate you use 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.029
 for his colleague and evening shows 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.849
 so that's really up to you to see what we can do 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.219
 but percent 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.049
 the woman who is not finished I do not have a group strategy 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.859
 this is usually a question if frankly it is quite feasible 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.009
 and so there to bring her back to their shop at the boards and mac 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.559
 he often has to suffer that part 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.970
 shapes the plastic is often it fits more in the case but 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.199
 clermont we do not care 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.699
 because m 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.679
 the max boat is decided to be quoted so the crazy gig completely 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.229
 to you see her 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.969
 and makes more time as such it does not matter 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:37.339
 sincerely it makes me nothing at all we never refused a contract 84 kind 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:38.080
 details 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.590
 and to be quite honest 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.960
 I think the makeup artists content of the application 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.000
 of packing that you bring heaven sky trust us 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.900
 on the first goal of the rome tournament 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.199
 some 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.199
 I start from my own incredible experience 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.110
 this is a period of challenges for the state since it is very 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.180
 although it's sabo recycling 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.259
 so that's it's a precise blood container like that it's 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.210
 Fixed mobile flasks + 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.069
