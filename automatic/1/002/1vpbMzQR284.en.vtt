00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.650
 We now knit only once a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.949
 Back for a pretty big time 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.800
 One piece body size 60 can be certain 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:52.760
 Move to other sizes we catch 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:55.160
 with the double bed on here 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:03.920
 a kassa knitting machine with 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.489
 double bed have the advantage with motor too 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.729
 knit 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.580
 because the distance in my profession with 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:31.729
 eight hours of work too exhausting 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:34.130
 Will the mesh width for this dress 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.459
 is 83 83 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.709
 so I always make the information I 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.259
 could now say 186 mesh 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:45.170
 But as the machines in the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.380
 middle number zero is it 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.979
 easier right and left the stitches 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.979
 to indicate the number 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 would like to knit a right-left pattern 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.259
 I pick two right two left for that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.849
 down every other round two stitches 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.610
 Year two machines as I always say 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:22.030
 and the same with something 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:23.860
 the half reader here now I sit down 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.940
 first my glasses on makes 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:34.200
 better leave the thread between the two 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:44.680
 Needle beds fall down hold down 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:46.569
 as an idea with a clothespin for the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 first row I open both beds 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.750
 zero 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.959
 my stop row can happen 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.370
 I think here is a knot in the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.420
 I want to take care of myself afterwards 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 only know for a moment 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:35.230
 I lead below at 1 between the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:36.970
 mesh through for the part 1 and 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.380
 complain the whole with a round 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.410
 weight in the middle in the double becomes quite 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.280
 important at the beginning a few key 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.170
 Press when I serve up the bridge 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.190
 I have to go in the left direction 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.690
 down the lever for the right direction 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.290
 push up that is the machine 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.620
 Strictly a row above or below one 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.830
 in my case only once and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.830
 here 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.740
 in many books , there will be three rows 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.959
 stated I press with the lever dina 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.760
 the nail bed at two points still there 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.780
 and afterwards make that half liver 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.710
 back next to all buttons 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.570
 rausschmiss take everything back to normal 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.480
 the needle strength one for the first 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.480
 row hold the weight
