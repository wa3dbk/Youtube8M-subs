keep<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.080> guys<00:02:41.200> informed<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:42.160> personally<00:02:42.670> I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
keep you guys informed but personally I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.949 
keep you guys informed but personally I
think<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.000> they<00:02:43.330> are<00:02:43.510> gonna<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.810> getting

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
think it they are gonna be getting

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.100 
think it they are gonna be getting
servers<00:02:44.380> too<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:45.880> because<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.750> does<00:02:46.930> not

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
servers too just because it does not

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.920 
servers too just because it does not
make<00:02:47.319> any<00:02:47.530> sense<00:02:48.299> why<00:02:49.299> they<00:02:49.450> wouldn't<00:02:49.750> want<00:02:49.840> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
make any sense why they wouldn't want to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.080 
make any sense why they wouldn't want to
slither<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> same<00:02:50.680> exact<00:02:51.040> field<00:02:51.340> unless

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
slither the same exact field unless

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.740 
slither the same exact field unless
there's<00:02:52.299> something<00:02:52.480> with<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
there's something with the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.780 
there's something with the
cross-platform<00:02:53.230> stuff<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.100> obviously<00:02:54.700> you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
cross-platform stuff so obviously you

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.300 
cross-platform stuff so obviously you
wouldn't<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.060> able<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.239> play<00:02:55.390> Windows<00:02:56.140> 10<00:02:56.530> with
