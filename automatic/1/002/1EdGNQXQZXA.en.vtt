hey guys it's phil from local motors as
you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.179> see<00:00:12.299> art<00:00:12.420> wheezy<00:00:12.750> got<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> lot<00:00:13.230> taller

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
you can see art wheezy got a lot taller

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.700 
you can see art wheezy got a lot taller
the<00:00:14.070> last<00:00:14.280> time<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.580> saw<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.470> we're<00:00:16.470> gonna<00:00:16.590> be

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the last time you saw it we're gonna be

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.300 
the last time you saw it we're gonna be
using<00:00:16.950> this<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:17.880> as<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:20.100> source

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
for the 3d printed vehicle so the only

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
for the 3d printed vehicle so the only
way<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.690> access<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.170> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.440> the<00:00:25.530> components

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
way to access a lot of the components

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.340 
way to access a lot of the components
such<00:00:26.850> as<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.090> battery<00:00:27.360> it's<00:00:27.900> underneath<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
such as the battery it's underneath the

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.810 
such as the battery it's underneath the
vehicle<00:00:28.800> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.980> why<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.370> here<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.700> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
vehicle which is why it's up here on the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.419 
vehicle which is why it's up here on the
stand<00:00:30.060> i<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.350> tasked<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.710> getting<00:00:32.250> all

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:32.429 
stand i was tasked with getting all

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.220 
stand i was tasked with getting all
these<00:00:32.519> tool<00:00:32.759> tools<00:00:33.300> together<00:00:33.449> because<00:00:33.929> I<00:00:33.960> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
these tool tools together because I have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
these tool tools together because I have
the<00:00:34.410> most<00:00:34.559> experience<00:00:35.059> breaking<00:00:36.059> apart

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the most experience breaking apart

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.150 
the most experience breaking apart
electric<00:00:36.539> vehicles<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.859> working<00:00:38.070> with

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
electric vehicles so I'm working with

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
electric vehicles so I'm working with
high<00:00:38.370> voltage<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.300> will<00:00:39.690> become<00:00:39.929> a<00:00:40.379> more

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
high voltage this is will become a more

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.139 
high voltage this is will become a more
generic<00:00:40.829> evie<00:00:41.789> teardown<00:00:42.210> area<00:00:43.850> from<00:00:44.909> even

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
generic evie teardown area from even

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.560 
generic evie teardown area from even
larger<00:00:45.420> vehicles<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.379> we'll<00:00:46.679> be<00:00:46.999> hopefully<00:00:47.999> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
larger vehicles so we'll be hopefully in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.239 
larger vehicles so we'll be hopefully in
the<00:00:48.659> near<00:00:48.780> future<00:00:48.960> carrying<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.949> battery

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
the near future carrying out the battery

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.369 
the near future carrying out the battery
which<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.909> first<00:00:51.089> step<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:52.109> tearing

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
which is the first step in also tearing

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
which is the first step in also tearing
apart<00:00:52.440> most<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> drivetrain<00:00:53.690> one<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
apart most of the drivetrain one of the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
apart most of the drivetrain one of the
biggest<00:00:55.170> challenges<00:00:55.769> for<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.460> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> area

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
biggest challenges for this kind of area

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.239 
biggest challenges for this kind of area
is<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.929> it<00:00:58.079> eventually<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.920> open<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
is that it eventually will be open to

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:00.680 
is that it eventually will be open to
community<00:00:59.550> members<00:00:59.699> most<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.479> haven't

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
community members most of which haven't

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.169 
community members most of which haven't
torn<00:01:01.019> down<00:01:01.170> electric<00:01:01.979> vehicles<00:01:02.309> before<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
torn down electric vehicles before so

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.960 
torn down electric vehicles before so
we're<00:01:03.690> building<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.320> toolkit<00:01:05.309> for

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
we're building up in a toolkit for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.420 
we're building up in a toolkit for
working<00:01:06.690> on<00:01:06.810> vehicles<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.950> 800

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
working on vehicles that are up to 800

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.170 
working on vehicles that are up to 800
volts<00:01:08.840> DC<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> battery<00:01:11.190> pack<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.120> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
volts DC for the battery pack one of the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760 
volts DC for the battery pack one of the
biggest<00:01:12.450> challenges<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.260> vehicles<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
biggest challenges for these vehicles is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.840 
biggest challenges for these vehicles is
just<00:01:13.950> making<00:01:14.100> sure<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.400> everyone's<00:01:14.700> safe

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
just making sure that everyone's safe

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
just making sure that everyone's safe
around<00:01:15.780> them<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> why<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.740> have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
around them which is why we have

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.040 
around them which is why we have
electrical<00:01:17.790> eyes<00:01:17.910> electrically<00:01:18.660> isolated

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
electrical eyes electrically isolated

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.350 
electrical eyes electrically isolated
format<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:20.370> have<00:01:20.400> electrically<00:01:20.970> isolated

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
format we have electrically isolated

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
format we have electrically isolated
tooling<00:01:21.920> because<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.010> first<00:01:23.220> step<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> work

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
tooling because the first step of work

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
tooling because the first step of work
on<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> TV<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.510> disconnecting<00:01:25.080> power<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.980> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
on a TV is disconnecting power a lot of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.320 
on a TV is disconnecting power a lot of
the<00:01:26.160> vehicles<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.730> surface<00:01:27.120> plug

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the vehicles will have a surface plug

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.000 
the vehicles will have a surface plug
which<00:01:27.660> enables<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.230> still<00:01:28.650> work<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
which enables you to still work on the

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.500 
which enables you to still work on the
vehicle<00:01:29.340> while<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> battery<00:01:29.850> pack<00:01:30.060> still<00:01:30.360> in
