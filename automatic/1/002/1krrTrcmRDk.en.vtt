the sugar which we creamed for about
three<00:00:48.570> minutes<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> reason<00:00:49.410> why<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.680> did

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
three minutes and the reason why we did

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
three minutes and the reason why we did
that<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.219> low<00:00:50.760> speed<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.510> gets<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.960> lot<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that on low speed so it gets a lot of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600 
that on low speed so it gets a lot of
air<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.800> you're<00:00:52.949> getting<00:00:53.190> fluffing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
air in there so you're getting fluffing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.130 
air in there so you're getting fluffing
and<00:00:53.730> everything<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> oh<00:00:54.780> yeah<00:00:54.989> my

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the batter and again the reason why you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340 
the batter and again the reason why you
