00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.750
 Hi there, this is the first point of the game. 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.750
 talking about bill 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.369
 today our review we will 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.710
 consider super hatch surf goat 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.810
 and in this case his two representatives 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.350
 of four is 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.110
 unfiltered and new to you recently 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.900
 Enough went on sale and whether 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.160
 good black what can i say about it 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.590
 beer as a whole it is brewed in 1000 1874 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.540
 years in finely resting at the factory 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.930
 only the brewer is resting this beer 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.760
 is one of the most leading 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.250
 positions at the start of the exchange of which 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.450
 brewed in Russia that is but very 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.460
 popular in Russia 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.390
 Visually, many drink it in their 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.059
 time is also pretty preference for it 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.149
 light we start them with and filtered 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.149
 of beer 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.100
 let's start with black 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.660
 here she looks like this 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.390
 very much like a snowman 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.310
 much thicker foam that is 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.060
 this she from large bubbles is worth 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.420
 Guinness began as he had bright 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.420
 saturated 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.210
 sour 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.940
 not even hot to tell him about this beer 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.180
 this beer is considered rather weak 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.630
 because basically the king is so friends with 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.450
 a 45 maybe more turnover but 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.190
 these are three two turns of all have and I but 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.190
 does not seem future 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.180
 bring a nice plus sweet taste 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.090
 I do n’t look for much criticism 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.540
 it seems how much honey gives and little 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.750
 beer 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.090
 draft beer in dark bars 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.260
 sweets honor to take a normal light 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.630
 what is the bottle version is 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 very good for example when I drink 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.150
 stage I got such a small 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.410
 desire in this feast to make a marinade for 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.300
 chicken wings in principle its taste 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.000
 very well suited for this marina 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.530
 need to add a little honey sun a 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.600
 if the whole thing is with garlic then 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.330
 period to mix the marinate and then 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.940
 fry will be very tasty I think 50 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.720
 rubles for grandma to marinate us 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.769
 a couple of kilograms and three kilograms of meat 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.769
 I think it's a little 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.160
 I am very pleased to put estimates 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.650
 anti-russian carcass and now let's 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.310
 try the electronic variety of this beer on 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.170
 the bank says in new letters 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.290
 unfiltered 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.290
 emphasis on the last letter 49 turns 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:49.390
 1 tight tight bubbles change 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.330
 filtered she doesn’t pull well 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.989
 generally transparent almost here it is 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.700
 almost not sold at the same price as 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.459
 the rest of the beer me always 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.610
 amused such a situation when it is worth 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.090
 line of one type of beer do different 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.920
 varieties 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.630
 they all stand exactly the same 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.209
 the feeling that they are just different at the end 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.480
 beautiful chooses i don't know which one 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.570
 the price absolutely be the same antenna 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.030
 I don’t know and love from him 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.489
 need to build a hut that I will say about the smell 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.530
 it is firstly it is so about the same 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.620
 as well as the mind and features a black goat but there have 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.630
 I am so pronounced not to amuse 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.320
 that me upstairs 5 hat left and 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.650
 stomp 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.910
 recipe and how you see beer 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.770
 barely change the unfiltered 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.260
 maybe of course I have everything at the bottom 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:49.780
 banks left to spill enough 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:56.050
 soft, pleasant to the taste watery and 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:58.120
 it's kind of too sour I sang 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.120
 basically have me so taste 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.580
 characteristics sour but this one 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.710
 some not that exhale six she's so 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.560
 the resulting acid may 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.020
 kept it wrong but what it doesn’t 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.310
 filtered I tell them to be on on 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.800
 softer usually 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.470
 and the blogger of the original camp 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.100
 of a little bitterness here i'm not he 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.300
 softer on the party touched not call 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.130
 ie stretch commit 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.560
 pink pleases skin keeps well 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.440
 I even drank a few times 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.730
 have come so far there swims save 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.020
 its form 50 and for such for such a beer 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.400
 it seems a little bit on the goods 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.040
 Well , let's put the evaluation node 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.760
 cheong page caliper we brew gets 6 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.400
 points used light cat liber 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.280
 Catch us gets 3 with half the shaft then 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.500
 how unfiltered you don't call your camp 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.900
 it is also impossible to evaluate at all well here 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.420
 the goat gave him a grade of 6 although I 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.640
 I appreciate you serbia so from the dark 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.160
 she is nice but a big estimate i want 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.590
 put it so to speak connector 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.300
 option because canned principle 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.090
 it seems to me to put a big price not 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.090
 the project with you was a hero to everyone
