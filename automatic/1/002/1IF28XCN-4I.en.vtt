00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
and don't be a meerkat okay the next one

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.889 
and don't be a meerkat okay the next one
and<00:01:47.649> feed<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.639> player<00:01:48.819> first<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.329> I'm<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.569> base

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
and feed the player first so I'm a base

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.149 
and feed the player first so I'm a base
which<00:01:50.169> is<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.409> people<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.770> stand<00:01:50.919> at<00:01:51.069> the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
which is the people that stand at the

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.639 
which is the people that stand at the
back<00:01:51.279> of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.639> court<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.299> basically<00:01:53.079> even

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
back of the court and basically even

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.719 
back of the court and basically even
though<00:01:53.679> boys<00:01:53.979> are<00:01:54.130> coming<00:01:54.340> towards<00:01:54.609> you<00:01:54.669> you

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
though boys are coming towards you you

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.419 
though boys are coming towards you you
still<00:01:54.939> have<00:01:55.029> to<00:01:55.179> feed<00:01:55.779> them<00:01:55.899> first<00:01:56.109> before<00:01:56.439> I'm

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
still have to feed them first before I'm

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.789 
still have to feed them first before I'm
learning<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.179> much<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.659> next<00:01:58.810> one<00:01:59.109> the<00:01:59.499> score

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
learning so much the next one the score

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.139 
learning so much the next one the score
is<00:01:59.829> odd<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.159> Bulls<00:02:00.340> stay<00:02:00.549> in<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:00.729> pod

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
is odd the Bulls stay in the pod

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.239 
is odd the Bulls stay in the pod
the<00:02:01.719> score<00:02:01.989> is<00:02:02.020> odd<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.469> Bulls<00:02:02.739> stay<00:02:03.009> in<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
the score is odd the Bulls stay in the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.069 
the score is odd the Bulls stay in the
pod<00:02:03.459> okay<00:02:03.789> what<00:02:03.969> does<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.179> mean<00:02:04.389> so<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.899> means

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
pod okay what does a mean so it means

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.839 
pod okay what does a mean so it means
that<00:02:05.289> if<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.649> score<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.310> two<00:02:06.459> players<00:02:06.700> of

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
that if the score of the two players of

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.300 
that if the score of the two players of
the<00:02:07.029> total<00:02:07.599> is<00:02:07.840> odd<00:02:08.050> then<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.739> Bulls<00:02:08.890> stay<00:02:09.160> at

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
the total is odd then the Bulls stay at

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.919 
the total is odd then the Bulls stay at
the<00:02:09.399> same<00:02:09.520> event<00:02:09.759> as<00:02:09.849> they<00:02:09.940> were<00:02:10.000> before<00:02:10.209> so

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
the same event as they were before so

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.120 
the same event as they were before so
that<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.319> players<00:02:11.530> will<00:02:11.680> change<00:02:11.890> ends

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
that the players will change ends

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.620 
that the players will change ends
therefore<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> new<00:02:12.880> player<00:02:13.060> will<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.210> serving

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
therefore a new player will be serving

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.350 
therefore a new player will be serving
got<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.530> okay<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.040> last<00:02:15.220> one<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:16.120> kind

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
got you okay and last one and it's kind

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.290 
got you okay and last one and it's kind
of<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.480> opposite

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
of the opposite

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.050 
of the opposite
even<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.930> balls<00:02:18.110> are<00:02:18.230> leaving<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
even the balls are leaving so if the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.340 
even the balls are leaving so if the
balls<00:02:20.240> are<00:02:20.360> leaving<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> players<00:02:20.990> aren't

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
balls are leaving the players aren't

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.220 
balls are leaving the players aren't
swapping<00:02:22.010> because<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.460> even<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.150> then<00:02:23.780> that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
swapping because it's even and then that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.900 
swapping because it's even and then that
means<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.920> balls<00:02:25.100> changing<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
means that the balls changing so the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.460 
means that the balls changing so the
players<00:02:26.120> aren't<00:02:26.360> suffering<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.690> new<00:02:26.960> player

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
players aren't suffering a new player
