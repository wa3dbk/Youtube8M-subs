what I'm thinking is is a seven again so

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
what I'm thinking is is a seven again so
on<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> second<00:01:33.570> beat<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> EE<00:01:34.409> C

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
on the second beat you see that EE C

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.480 
on the second beat you see that EE C
sharp<00:01:35.310> B<00:01:35.640> flat<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.290> a7<00:01:37.710> flat<00:01:38.100> nine

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
chords so I'm kind of playing and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
chords so I'm kind of playing and
starting<00:01:42.540> thinking<00:01:43.100> approaching<00:01:44.100> aged<00:01:44.310> seven

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
starting thinking approaching aged seven

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.380 
starting thinking approaching aged seven
flat<00:01:45.060> nine<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.659> go<00:01:52.040> okay<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
flat nine so I go okay so and then it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.459 
flat nine so I go okay so and then it
gets<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> an<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.040> end<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> go

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
gets to an a at the end and then I go

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.459 
gets to an a at the end and then I go
and<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.040> third<00:01:59.280> beat<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:01.229> up

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and then the third beat and then I go up

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.340
