there's<00:01:14.460> an<00:01:14.640> indentation<00:01:15.210> left<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.259> going

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
there's an indentation left so I'm going

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.929 
there's an indentation left so I'm going
to<00:01:16.500> use<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> part<00:01:17.729> that's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to use that to be the part that's

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the top tier and then again at a 90

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.810 
the top tier and then again at a 90
degree<00:02:06.630> angle<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.830> want<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.070> make<00:02:08.220> sure<00:02:08.250> each
