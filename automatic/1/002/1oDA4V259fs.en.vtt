00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
one I think it cooks faster like this
too<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:42.530> like<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.950> thick<00:01:44.190> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
too because of like it's not as thick so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
too because of like it's not as thick so
it<00:01:44.790> cooks<00:01:45.060> pretty<00:01:45.360> quick<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:48.020> mean<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.140> can't
