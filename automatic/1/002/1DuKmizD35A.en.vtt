they were saying it was their holy grail
and<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.260> got<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.160> stoked

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and that got me really really stoked

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
and that got me really really stoked
supposedly<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.390> heard<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.960> multiple<00:00:58.199> sources

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
supposedly I heard on multiple sources

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
supposedly I heard on multiple sources
on<00:00:59.039> Google<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.460> Kim<00:00:59.820> Kardashian<00:01:00.260> actually

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
on Google that Kim Kardashian actually

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
on Google that Kim Kardashian actually
wore<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.800> Edition<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.280> her<00:01:02.430> wedding<00:01:02.640> day

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
wore this one Edition on her wedding day

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
wore this one Edition on her wedding day
so<00:01:03.110> instantly<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.320> sold<00:01:04.680> me<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> thought

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so instantly that sold me and I thought

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.890 
so instantly that sold me and I thought
if<00:01:05.460> Kim<00:01:05.670> Kardashian<00:01:06.210> could<00:01:06.360> wear<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.750> her

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
if Kim Kardashian could wear this on her

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.270 
if Kim Kardashian could wear this on her
wedding<00:01:07.049> day<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.130> should

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
wedding day then I think I should

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
wedding day then I think I should
probably<00:01:08.460> try<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.330> bought<00:01:09.689> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
probably try this out so I bought this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550 
probably try this out so I bought this
foundation<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.580> $42<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> Sephora<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.600> live<00:01:13.439> in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
foundation for $42 a Sephora I live in

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.020 
foundation for $42 a Sephora I live in
Canada<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> prices<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.820> bit

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
Canada and the prices are a little bit

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
Canada and the prices are a little bit
jacked<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> may<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.619> less

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
jacked up so it may be a little bit less

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.440 
jacked up so it may be a little bit less
expensive<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> live<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> States<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
expensive if you live in the States so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.030 
expensive if you live in the States so
this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> bottle<00:01:19.500> looks<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
this is what the bottle looks like I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.219

powder the rest of my face because I

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.350 
powder the rest of my face because I
really<00:04:34.500> want<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.800> see<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.280> longevity<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.880> this

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360

finished doing makeup on a client it is
so<00:04:58.020> hot<00:04:58.470> outside<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.310> 82<00:04:59.970> degrees<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.740> I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
so hot outside it is 82 degrees and I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.920 
so hot outside it is 82 degrees and I
just<00:05:02.370> got<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.700> really<00:05:02.880> really<00:05:03.090> hot<00:05:03.330> car<00:05:03.570> so

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
just got in a really really hot car so

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.960 
just got in a really really hot car so
I'm<00:05:04.110> sweating<00:05:05.100> even<00:05:05.340> more<00:05:05.490> it's<00:05:05.730> been<00:05:05.820> about

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
I'm sweating even more it's been about

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.080 
I'm sweating even more it's been about
three<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.690> half<00:05:06.720> hours<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.610> think<00:05:08.730> that's

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
three and a half hours so I think that's

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.820 
three and a half hours so I think that's
pretty<00:05:09.300> good<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:09.750> literally<00:05:10.050> has<00:05:10.350> not<00:05:10.620> moved

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
pretty good it literally has not moved

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.830 
pretty good it literally has not moved
on<00:05:11.070> my<00:05:11.160> face<00:05:11.430> there<00:05:11.910> is<00:05:12.060> like<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> little<00:05:12.630> bit<00:05:12.750> of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
on my face there is like a little bit of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.600 
on my face there is like a little bit of
buildup<00:05:13.200> of<00:05:13.350> foundation<00:05:13.919> like<00:05:14.100> around<00:05:14.490> my

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
buildup of foundation like around my

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.490 
buildup of foundation like around my
nose<00:05:14.669> area<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.540> think<00:05:15.750> that's<00:05:15.930> normal<00:05:16.350> that

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
nose area but I think that's normal that

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.380 
nose area but I think that's normal that
happens<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:16.919> most<00:05:17.100> of<00:05:17.190> my<00:05:17.250> foundations<00:05:17.820> but

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
happens with most of my foundations but

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.580 
happens with most of my foundations but
other<00:05:18.570> than<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.840> everything<00:05:19.350> is<00:05:19.440> looking

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
other than that everything is looking

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.150 
other than that everything is looking
good<00:05:19.919> so<00:05:20.370> I'm<00:05:20.700> gonna<00:05:20.970> go<00:05:21.300> home<00:05:22.020> now<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.980> will
