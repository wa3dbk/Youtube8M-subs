 tatyana and welcome to my channel 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 I continue the series of thematic 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.820
 workshops and today I will do 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.820
 earrings with a volume sponge bob as pineapple 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.919
 I need a blade for work 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.430
 brushes polymer clay light green 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.350
 red yellow and gray 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.290
 metal powder fimo accessories and 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.809
 acrylic varnish, knead well yellow 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.930
 polymer clay and roll out thick 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.510
 approximately 2 3 millimeters using 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.790
 oval qatar cut two blanks and 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.229
 blade cut off the lower part to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.229
 get pineapple shape 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.089
 so that the plastic does not stick to Lithuania 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.660
 notches can be applied through food 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.660
 film 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.439
 I roll out your salad polymer clay 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:35.100
 I cut it into small pieces of which 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.530
 I will make leaves on us and to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.049
 hide pin 1 slip sticking 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.750
 in the middle and insert it drank with 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.579
 loop a loop of clay and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.579
 I am covering the pin with the second sheet 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.990
 we 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.240
 in the same way form the remaining sheets 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.580
 rolling the droplets with a needle blade or 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.580
 I put a stack of streaks on each sheet 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.450
 sticking all the sheets to the pineapple 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.910
 fine brush on our golden 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.910
 metallic powder on the grooves on us and 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.590
 I roll two small blue balls from 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.840
 which will make the window roll out 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.019
 gray polymer clay in a thread and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.610
 I wrap her every ball once ivy 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.610
 the resulting billet 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.880
 I paste the windows to the pineapple in the same place 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.820
 how she houses spongebob as well as 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.240
 windows do the door and stick to it 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.240
 pen 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.230
 and from gray polymer clay can 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.270
 make a pipe then our houses will be in 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.270
 Exactly like a house pineapples 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.850
 add a couple of bright colors and you can 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.040
 send burn 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.479
 I burn the net for 10 minutes at a temperature 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.479
 one hundred and thirty degrees 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.690
 after cooling down I cover and varnish 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.419
 to fix the powder on the plastic 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:15.370
 so the network will turn out brighter and not in the morning 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.370
 will wipe on clothes and skin 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.870
 round pliers throw a pin into a loop 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.400
 I open my ear at the earrings 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.400
 and weigh and in open 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.160
 my pineapple earrings are ready if you 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.960
