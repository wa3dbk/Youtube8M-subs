all this stuff right here super fast
auxilary<00:01:29.950> SATA<00:01:30.340> port<00:01:30.610> as<00:01:30.700> well

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
auxilary SATA port as well

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.719 
auxilary SATA port as well
now<00:01:31.479> there's<00:01:32.140> also<00:01:32.349> another<00:01:32.860> SATA<00:01:33.250> port<00:01:33.550> on

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
now there's also another SATA port on

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:34.949 
now there's also another SATA port on
here<00:01:33.940> as<00:01:34.030> well<00:01:34.209> so<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.569> can<00:01:34.720> use<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
here as well so that you can use the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.660 
here as well so that you can use the
controller<00:01:35.380> but<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.709> only<00:01:35.979> provides<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
controller but it only provides the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.540 
controller but it only provides the
power<00:01:37.000> for<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> single<00:01:38.140> drive<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.340> see<00:01:39.459> the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
power for a single drive you can see the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.550 
power for a single drive you can see the
transfer<00:01:40.000> rates<00:01:40.179> up<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.360> 550<00:01:41.050> megabytes<00:01:41.440> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
transfer rates up to 550 megabytes a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.070 
transfer rates up to 550 megabytes a
second<00:01:41.979> that's<00:01:42.880> using<00:01:43.209> a<00:01:43.270> single<00:01:43.630> drive<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
second that's using a single drive and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.990 
second that's using a single drive and
if<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.229> use<00:01:44.410> two<00:01:44.649> drives<00:01:44.950> up<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.280> 800

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
if you use two drives up to 800

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.999 
if you use two drives up to 800
megabytes<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.599> second<00:01:46.989> so<00:01:47.649> pretty<00:01:47.860> interesting

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
megabytes a second so pretty interesting

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.089 
megabytes a second so pretty interesting
stuff<00:01:48.520> its<00:01:48.970> bootable<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.660> both<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.989> PC<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.709> a

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
stuff its bootable in both the PC and a

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.609 
stuff its bootable in both the PC and a
Mac<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:52.569> particularly<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:53.319> got<00:01:53.530> I'm

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
Mac and this particularly I got I'm

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.889 
Mac and this particularly I got I'm
going<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.830> put<00:01:53.979> inside<00:01:54.099> my<00:01:54.429> Mac<00:01:54.670> Pro<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.750> can

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
going to put inside my Mac Pro so I can

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.389 
going to put inside my Mac Pro so I can
make<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.200> boot<00:01:56.440> drive<00:01:56.739> and<00:01:56.920> scratch<00:01:57.130> drive

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
make my boot drive and scratch drive

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.669 
make my boot drive and scratch drive
very<00:01:57.640> very<00:01:57.970> fast<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:58.630> let's<00:01:59.319> just<00:01:59.440> go<00:01:59.560> ahead

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
very very fast so let's just go ahead

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.320 
very very fast so let's just go ahead
you'll<00:02:00.160> flip<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.520> around<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.940> back<00:02:01.090> real

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
you'll flip it around the back real

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.119 
you'll flip it around the back real
quick<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:02.050> can<00:02:02.200> see<00:02:02.410> it's<00:02:02.530> compatible<00:02:02.890> with

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.129 
quick you can see it's compatible with

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:07.410 
quick you can see it's compatible with
all<00:02:03.250> PCI<00:02:04.060> 2.0<00:02:04.660> slots<00:02:05.940> don't<00:02:06.940> use<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.149> One<00:02:07.390> X

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
all PCI 2.0 slots don't use a One X

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.229 
all PCI 2.0 slots don't use a One X
though<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.259> 4<00:02:08.590> 8<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.340> 16<00:02:09.580> are<00:02:10.090> all

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
though but 4 8 and 16 are all

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.119 
though but 4 8 and 16 are all
recommended<00:02:11.580> basic<00:02:12.580> instructions

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.220 

so<00:02:16.999> let<00:02:17.150> me<00:02:17.180> go<00:02:17.359> ahead<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.569> open<00:02:17.749> this<00:02:17.810> up<00:02:17.989> by

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
so let me go ahead and open this up by

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.039 
so let me go ahead and open this up by
the<00:02:18.290> way<00:02:18.469> it<00:02:18.680> will<00:02:18.799> work<00:02:18.859> an<00:02:19.249> XP<00:02:19.819> it'll<00:02:20.689> work<00:02:20.870> in

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
the way it will work an XP it'll work in

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.559 
the way it will work an XP it'll work in
Vista<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.709> I'm<00:02:21.889> working<00:02:22.129> all<00:02:22.249> those<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.359> let's

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
Vista and I'm working all those so let's

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.839 
Vista and I'm working all those so let's
just<00:02:23.719> go<00:02:23.840> ahead<00:02:24.049> we'll<00:02:24.230> pull<00:02:24.439> this<00:02:24.590> out<00:02:24.849> not

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
just go ahead we'll pull this out not

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.610 
just go ahead we'll pull this out not
really<00:02:25.879> too<00:02:26.299> much<00:02:26.329> to<00:02:26.719> this<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.409> they<00:02:27.469> get

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
really too much to this and they get

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.979 
really too much to this and they get
this<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:27.889> of<00:02:28.010> there<00:02:28.129> so<00:02:28.700> here's<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.749> Internet

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
this out of there so here's the Internet

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.369 
this out of there so here's the Internet
itself<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.450> thing's<00:02:32.689> coming<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.079> market

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
itself now this thing's coming to market

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.429 
itself now this thing's coming to market
at<00:02:33.469> about<00:02:33.790> $99<00:02:34.790> some<00:02:35.719> people<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.079> know<00:02:36.139> once

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
at about $99 some people I know once

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.990 
at about $99 some people I know once
again<00:02:36.590> will<00:02:36.769> probably<00:02:37.069> scoff<00:02:37.310> at<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.549> but

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
again will probably scoff at that but

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.300 
again will probably scoff at that but
there<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.689> real<00:02:39.019> market<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.739> real<00:02:39.920> purpose

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310
