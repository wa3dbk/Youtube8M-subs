it's gonna do is what it usually does is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.020 
it's gonna do is what it usually does is
that<00:00:13.410> bursting<00:00:13.980> kills<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> zombies<00:00:14.820> near

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that bursting kills all the zombies near

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.790 
that bursting kills all the zombies near
it<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> first<00:00:15.870> time<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> gives

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
it the first time I do it here it gives

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620 
it the first time I do it here it gives
me<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> death<00:00:17.190> machine<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> powerup<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
me a death machine as the powerup and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.760 
me a death machine as the powerup and
once<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.900> start<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> use<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.320> death<00:00:19.470> machine<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
once I start to use the death machine I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.980 
once I start to use the death machine I
even<00:00:20.130> get<00:00:20.220> more<00:00:20.490> power-ups<00:00:20.880> right<00:00:21.480> away<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> get

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
even get more power-ups right away I get

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
even get more power-ups right away I get
two<00:00:22.199> more<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> fire<00:00:23.310> sale<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.119> nuke

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
two more I get the fire sale and a nuke

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.210 
two more I get the fire sale and a nuke
so<00:00:25.050> right<00:00:25.230> there<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> could<00:00:25.590> take<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.859> three

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so right there you could take out three

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
so right there you could take out three
effective<00:00:26.849> power-ups<00:00:27.359> right<00:00:27.750> off<00:00:27.930> from

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
effective power-ups right off from

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
effective power-ups right off from
throwing<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> QED<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:29.070> well<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.490> killing<00:00:29.789> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
throwing the QED as well as killing that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.310 
throwing the QED as well as killing that
whole<00:00:30.060> package<00:00:30.240> Ami's<00:00:30.720> which<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.019> very

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
whole package Ami's which is very

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.970 
whole package Ami's which is very
effective

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
effective

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.220 
effective
so<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> QED<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.149> extremely<00:00:33.780> helpful<00:00:33.989> as

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so the QED can be extremely helpful as

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.720 
so the QED can be extremely helpful as
you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.579> I'm<00:00:35.640> gonna

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you can see right there now I'm gonna

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.130 
you can see right there now I'm gonna
keep<00:00:35.940> playing<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.540> gonna<00:00:36.660> continue<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
keep playing and I'm gonna continue to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
keep playing and I'm gonna continue to
throw<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.500> other<00:00:37.649> key<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.129> QE<00:00:38.460> DS<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.480> know

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
throw my other key to QE DS and we know

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
throw my other key to QE DS and we know
a<00:00:39.690> couple<00:00:40.230> things<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.620> QED<00:00:40.980> does<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.520> thing<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
a couple things in QED does one thing it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.209 
a couple things in QED does one thing it
obviously<00:00:42.180> kills<00:00:42.450> them<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> big<00:00:42.960> pack

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
obviously kills them that big pack

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.590 
obviously kills them that big pack
sometimes<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.520> also<00:00:44.730> gives<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> power<00:00:45.360> ups

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
sometimes it also gives you power ups

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720 
sometimes it also gives you power ups
like<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> saw<00:00:46.050> before<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.340> screen

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
like you saw before right here my screen

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
like you saw before right here my screen
went<00:00:47.940> blank<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.780> sorry<00:00:48.989> about

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
went blank a little bit I'm sorry about

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.889 
went blank a little bit I'm sorry about
that<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.750> does

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that but we also know that it does

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.330 
that but we also know that it does
different<00:00:52.320> things<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.739> I've<00:00:52.890> seen<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
different things that I've seen that I

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.610 
different things that I've seen that I
haven't<00:00:53.730> actually<00:00:53.879> had<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.420> footage<00:00:54.750> yet<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
now you can see that I thought the QED

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
now you can see that I thought the QED
again<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> minute<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.079> get

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
normally does sometimes I just saw it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690

today<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> try<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.310> video

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
today I want to try to get this on video

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
today I want to try to get this on video
for<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> guys<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.810> throw<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> QED<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
for you guys you throw the QED and it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
for you guys you throw the QED and it
actually<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> red<00:01:11.729> perc<00:01:12.060> bottle<00:01:12.450> comes<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.840> it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
actually a red perc bottle comes up it's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
actually a red perc bottle comes up it's
called<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.650> inverted<00:01:14.070> perc<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.670> invert

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
called an inverted perc or an invert

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.730 
called an inverted perc or an invert
perc<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.630> happens<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.229> dom<00:01:16.530> bees

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
perc so what happens is if this dom bees

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
perc so what happens is if this dom bees
get<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.159> perk<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> powerup<00:01:18.180> they

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
get to that perk or that powerup they

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
get to that perk or that powerup they
take<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.380> perk<00:01:19.619> instead<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.159> getting<00:01:20.369> an
