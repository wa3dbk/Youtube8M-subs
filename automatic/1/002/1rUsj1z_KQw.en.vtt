00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.960
 andrÃ© 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.960
 Hello 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.370
 imagine that you got there to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.760
 take care 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.950
 a large sized dog or 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.610
 towel 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:12.170
 only you want to leave the tie already 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.850
 what a dangerous dog and what you 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.570
 have to learn on the leash of this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 heavy animal 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:29.270
 phil denario amaral to extend clothing 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.670
 just did not advance the dog gave a 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.720
 pulls the end of nothing and now the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.080
 what to do 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:46.119
 You need to leave the dog tied. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:48.830
 Let's give a hint that it's very simple. 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.390
 probably most people know 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.979
 how to do this but you may not have 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:02.619
 remembered in a moment of suffocation like this 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:08.660
 Let's see what our suggestion is going there. 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:13.040
 because here is the nylon thread that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.240
 we were at our disposal and we will use 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.790
 others 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:24.020
 another nylon thread also and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.150
 build a braid like we need 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.750
 leave only one meter 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.910
 I'll be enough so let's go 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:42.680
 bend this wire that measures around 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:47.510
 five meters to fold us in half and use 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.920
 this double part plus this double part and 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:57.290
 the line of clothesline also double so let's 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.340
 join these tips insert them here in the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.280
 base 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.769
 because it is serving to repair bear 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.940
 our work we will put here a 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:16.580
 pencil to learn and now let's 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.090
 build a braid are separating a 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.930
 of the extremities 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.040
 so come on, let's go 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.760
 the set of the right filda passes to the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.310
 left of the left to right 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.079
 right- to-left 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:42.680
 from left to right and always 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:47.060
 so on the left to the right 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.879
 right to left no braid goes 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.879
 being built 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:04.600
 we took river is different color to 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.600
 facilitate viewing 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.480
 so let's speed up this step 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:05:09.600
 so here is the braid is completed 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:16.340
 Let's now remove pencils that 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:22.140
 here's a tough rope for 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:25.110
 support the effort of the dog in 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:29.330
 want to let go 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.700
 remembering the following the final length 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.410
 this will be reduced braid around 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.440
 10% 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.960
 so if we want it to be that it has the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.600
 size of a meter for example we have 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.060
 than one meter and 10 or more 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.320
 material to be locked 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.650
 it's not just a braid 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.410
 usually done in long hair 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.540
 but can also be applied there to 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:03.330
 an emergency situation if there is no 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:07.770
 have a rope is thicker at home 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.950
 of course this tip was quite 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.970
 simple is not it really 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.380
 but sometimes we are in a situation of 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.810
 emergency 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:27.750
 without knowing how to solve and then ends up being 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.730
 and then there's this reminder ok then 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.980
 thanks for listening 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.980
 A hug, bye. 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.160
 Hmm 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
 i
