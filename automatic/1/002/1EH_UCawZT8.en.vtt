00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
square piece of paper and the first

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.720 
square piece of paper and the first
thing<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.440> want<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:05.040> fold<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.549> half

thing you want to do is fold in half

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.160 
thing you want to do is fold in half
diagonally<00:00:06.029> down<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> center<00:00:07.080> like<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:09.170> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
diagonally down the center like this and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.660 
diagonally down the center like this and
then<00:00:10.290> once<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.590> fold<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.920> diagonally<00:00:11.190> you

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
then once you fold it diagonally you

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120 
then once you fold it diagonally you
want<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> take<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.139> top<00:00:13.349> left<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> top

the next thing you want to do is you
want<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.260> take<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:59.280> top<00:00:59.489> layer<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.360> bottom

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
want to take the top layer on the bottom

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.579 
want to take the top layer on the bottom
point<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> fold<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:03.409> about<00:01:04.409> an

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
point you want to fold it up about an

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.710 
point you want to fold it up about an
inch<00:01:04.680> towards<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> top<00:01:06.229> like<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:08.540> then<00:01:09.540> once

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
inch towards the top like this then once

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
inch towards the top like this then once
you've<00:01:09.840> done<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.050> you<00:01:10.800> want<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you've done that you want to take that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.859 
you've done that you want to take that
whole<00:01:11.520> layer<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> bring<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.009> up

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
whole layer and you want to bring it up

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.890 
whole layer and you want to bring it up
and<00:01:15.869> fold<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.530> again<00:01:18.409> like<00:01:19.409> that

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
and fold it back down again like that

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.120 
and fold it back down again like that
when<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> reach<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.440> step<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
when you reach this step you want to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
when you reach this step you want to
turn<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> paper<00:01:23.550> over<00:01:27.050> now<00:01:28.050> what<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> want<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
turn the paper over now what you want to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.889 
turn the paper over now what you want to
do<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.460> want<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.640> take<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.300> bottom<00:01:30.630> left

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
do is you want to take the bottom left

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.469 
do is you want to take the bottom left
and<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.590> bottom<00:01:31.830> right<00:01:32.100> hand<00:01:32.250> sides<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and the bottom right hand sides of this

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
and the bottom right hand sides of this
square<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.800> you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> fold<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.490> into

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
square and you want to fold them into

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:47.150 
square and you want to fold them into
the<00:01:36.509> center<00:01:36.720> line<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:46.259> step<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.679> be<00:01:46.710> tricky

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
the center line this step can be tricky

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.770 
the center line this step can be tricky
because<00:01:47.369> you've<00:01:47.550> got<00:01:47.700> many<00:01:47.940> folds<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> paper

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
because you've got many folds of paper

00:01:48.780 --> 00:02:15.760 
because you've got many folds of paper
up<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.100> point<00:01:50.399> here

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.980 

and<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.820> eventually<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.630> should<00:02:17.810> look<00:02:17.930> like

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
and so eventually it should look like

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.040 
and so eventually it should look like
this<00:02:18.320> now<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.690> want<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.960> turn<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> paper<00:02:21.410> over

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
this now you want to turn the paper over

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.630 
this now you want to turn the paper over
and<00:02:24.050> what<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.290> want<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.500> do<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.460> want<00:02:25.610> to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
and what you want to do is you want to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.850 
and what you want to do is you want to
take<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> whole<00:02:26.120> model<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:27.320> want<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.530> fold<00:02:27.710> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
take the whole model you want to fold it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:37.450 
take the whole model you want to fold it
in<00:02:27.920> half<00:02:27.950> all<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.610> way<00:02:28.760> down<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> center<00:02:36.460> so

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
in half all the way down the center so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.910 
in half all the way down the center so
now<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.700> should<00:02:37.730> look<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:38.920> this

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
now it should look like this now this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320 
now it should look like this now this
end<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.310> model<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:40.880> be<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.150> tail

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
end of the model is going to be the tail

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.020 
end of the model is going to be the tail
of<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.600> mouse<00:02:42.070> what<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.160> want<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.340> do<00:02:43.490> is<00:02:43.820> you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
of the mouse what you want to do is you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.020 
of the mouse what you want to do is you
want<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.210> take<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:45.080> tail<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.820> want<00:02:46.970> to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
want to take the tail and you want to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.180 
want to take the tail and you want to
fold<00:02:47.240> it<00:02:47.450> over<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.220> across<00:02:49.460> like<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:51.190> then

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
fold it over and across like this then

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.370 
fold it over and across like this then
you<00:02:52.310> want<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.490> take<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.760> tail<00:02:52.910> again<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:54.140> fold

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
you want to take the tail again and fold

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.960 
you want to take the tail again and fold
it<00:02:54.500> back<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.010> don't<00:02:55.220> fold<00:02:55.490> all<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.850> it

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
it back but you don't fold all of it

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.670 
it back but you don't fold all of it
back<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.990> leave<00:02:57.170> about<00:02:57.410> a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
back you want to leave about a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.840 
back you want to leave about a
centimeter<00:02:58.750> still<00:02:59.750> fold<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.110> over<00:03:00.460> like<00:03:01.460> this

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.160 

so<00:03:04.850> now<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.060> should<00:03:05.180> look<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:07.990> now<00:03:08.990> what

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
so now it should look like that now what

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.630 
so now it should look like that now what
you<00:03:09.260> want<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.470> do<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.740> you<00:03:09.830> want<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> unfold

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
you want to do is you want to unfold

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.330 
you want to do is you want to unfold
that<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.350> open<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.800> mouse<00:03:12.950> back<00:03:13.190> up

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
that and then open the mouse back up

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.140 
that and then open the mouse back up
again<00:03:13.580> like<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:15.130> now<00:03:16.130> using<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.670> two<00:03:16.820> folds

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
again like this now using the two folds

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.910 
again like this now using the two folds
you<00:03:17.210> just<00:03:17.420> made<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:18.230> want<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.440> collapse<00:03:18.710> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
you just made you want to collapse the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.110 
you just made you want to collapse the
tail<00:03:19.130> inwards<00:03:20.350> like<00:03:21.350> this<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:24.820> unfold<00:03:25.820> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
tail inwards like this and unfold the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.260 
tail inwards like this and unfold the
last<00:03:26.930> section<00:03:27.380> out<00:03:27.530> again<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:32.030> now<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.210> should

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
last section out again so now it should

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.180 
last section out again so now it should
look<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.680> once<00:03:33.860> you've<00:03:34.010> done<00:03:34.130> that

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
look like that and once you've done that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.559 
look like that and once you've done that
you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:34.970> reclose<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.690> mouse

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.640 

then<00:03:42.569> you<00:03:42.720> can<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:42.989> adjust<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.470> table

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
then you can just adjust the table

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.360 
then you can just adjust the table
afterwards<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.590> last<00:03:46.799> thing<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.129> do<00:03:47.250> to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
afterwards the last thing to do to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.670 
afterwards the last thing to do to
finish<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.730> mouse<00:03:47.909> is<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.629> make<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> ears<00:03:49.140> and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
finish the mouse is to make the ears and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.039 
finish the mouse is to make the ears and
so<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.370> top<00:03:50.640> point<00:03:50.849> here<00:03:51.180> you've<00:03:51.900> got

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
so of this top point here you've got

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.210 
so of this top point here you've got
three<00:03:52.260> layers<00:03:52.909> and<00:03:53.909> take<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.209> outside<00:03:54.390> layers

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
three layers and take the outside layers

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.660 
three layers and take the outside layers
and<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.640> fold<00:03:56.849> them<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.519> will

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
and just fold them back and that will

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.949 
and just fold them back and that will
make<00:03:59.790> ears<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.480> origami<00:04:00.780> Mouse<00:04:02.959> then

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
make ears for the origami Mouse then

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.420 
make ears for the origami Mouse then
once<00:04:04.140> you've<00:04:04.260> finished<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.099> just<00:04:05.220> curl
