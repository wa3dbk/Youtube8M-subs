so I hope you enjoy it and my
inspiration<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.720> idea<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.410> came

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
inspiration for this idea actually came

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.910 
inspiration for this idea actually came
from<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.670> cube<00:00:30.119> hamster<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.199> he<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> link<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
from a cube hamster and he was a link to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.870 
from a cube hamster and he was a link to
his<00:00:32.189> video<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.210> gave<00:00:33.989> me<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> inspiration

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
his video that gave me the inspiration

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.450 
his video that gave me the inspiration
and<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> few<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.290> my<00:00:37.620> problems<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
and I had a few you know my problems I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.619 
and I had a few you know my problems I
didn't<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> design<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
didn't really like with the design I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
didn't really like with the design I
really<00:00:40.050> liked<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> idea<00:00:40.739> concept<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
really liked the idea concept but I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
really liked the idea concept but I
didn't<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.570> implemented<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
didn't like how it was implemented so I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
didn't like how it was implemented so I
decided<00:00:43.920> I'd<00:00:44.070> try<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:45.450> my<00:00:45.629> own<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
decided I'd try and do my own take on it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.610 
decided I'd try and do my own take on it
so<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.700> came<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.500> go<00:00:49.500> ahead

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so this is what I came up with go ahead

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
so this is what I came up with go ahead
and<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.920> ride<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.180> first<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:53.780> can

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and just ride it for you first you can

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.689 
and just ride it for you first you can
see<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.379> track<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.129> pops<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
see it this track just pops out of the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.099 
see it this track just pops out of the
wall<00:00:57.230> hit<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.440> lever<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> sexy<00:01:00.270> smiley

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
wall hit that lever in the sexy smiley

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.759 
wall hit that lever in the sexy smiley
face<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> video<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
face you want you to like the video so

face you want you to like the video so
do<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.159> him<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:11.330> anyways<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:16.520> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
do it for him and anyways in this you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.480 
do it for him and anyways in this you
can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.830> has<00:01:20.159> no

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
can see that this really has no

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.050 
can see that this really has no
limitations<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.650> can<00:01:22.650> put<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> anywhere<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
limitations you can put it anywhere that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
limitations you can put it anywhere that
you<00:01:24.180> want<00:01:24.210> along<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.080> wall<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.250> will

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you want along this wall and it will

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.510 
you want along this wall and it will
still<00:01:26.670> work<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.130> deal<00:01:29.310> with

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
still work you will have to deal with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
still work you will have to deal with
you<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.729> upward<00:01:30.299> wiring<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> guess<00:01:31.350> you'd

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
you know upward wiring so I guess you'd

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
you know upward wiring so I guess you'd
be<00:01:31.710> limited<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> fact<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> can't

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
be limited in the fact that you can't

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.289 
be limited in the fact that you can't
place<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.570> too<00:01:33.990> high<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> wall<00:01:35.180> if<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
place it too high on the wall if you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.609 
place it too high on the wall if you
don't<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.630> wiring<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> exposed

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
don't want wiring to be exposed

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.850 
don't want wiring to be exposed
somewhere<00:01:38.009> else<00:01:38.659> but<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.350> placed<00:01:40.590> as

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
somewhere else but it can be placed as

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.499 
somewhere else but it can be placed as
high<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.340> want<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> wall<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> that's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
high as you want on a wall and that's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.830 
high as you want on a wall and that's
really<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:45.479> yeah<00:01:45.659> I'll

really what I was going for so yeah I'll
show<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> how<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.320> works<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.720> here's<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
show you how this works now so here's a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.649 
show you how this works now so here's a
version<00:01:49.310> with<00:01:50.310> cutaway<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> wall<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> can

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
version with cutaway of wall so you can

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
version with cutaway of wall so you can
actually<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:53.549> section<00:01:53.939> that's<00:01:54.119> moving

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
actually see the section that's moving

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.850 
actually see the section that's moving
everything

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.920 

see<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.369> that's<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.820> open<00:02:00.329> process

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:12.800 

closed<00:02:03.930> process<00:02:10.370> see<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.030> definitely

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
closed process see so you can definitely

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.949 
closed process see so you can definitely
tell<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.470> doing<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.860> lot<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.450> weird<00:02:15.450> and

complex<00:02:17.540> things<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.200> wiring<00:02:19.680> process<00:02:20.069> I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
complex things in the wiring process I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.630 
complex things in the wiring process I
got<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.930> all<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.680> know<00:02:22.769> color<00:02:23.010> coded<00:02:23.430> so

know<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.349> can<00:02:28.470> kind<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.860> tell<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.830> over<00:02:32.040> here

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
know you can kind of tell and over here

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.640 
know you can kind of tell and over here
I'll<00:02:32.430> show<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.790> exactly<00:02:33.360> how<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.049> thing<00:02:34.380> is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I'll show you exactly how this thing is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.720 
I'll show you exactly how this thing is
working<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.760> open<00:02:39.120> already<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> got<00:02:41.489> so

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
working it's open already so I got so

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.479 
working it's open already so I got so
excited<00:02:44.360> all<00:02:45.360> right<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> important<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
excited all right so the important the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.960 
excited all right so the important the
important<00:02:47.880> thing<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.239> notice<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
important thing to notice here is that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.210 
important thing to notice here is that
right<00:02:50.970> now<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.180> purple<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.260> wall<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
right now the purple is the wall in the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.699 
right now the purple is the wall in the
blue<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:54.239> what<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.690> tracks<00:02:54.989> were<00:02:55.290> sitting<00:02:55.620> on

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
blue is what the tracks were sitting on

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:09.319 
blue is what the tracks were sitting on
up<00:02:55.920> here<00:02:56.720> now<00:02:57.720> when<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> pull<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> back<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.209> I

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
up here now when I pull it back now if I

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.809 
up here now when I pull it back now if I
cycle<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> again<00:03:11.180> becomes<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.480> wall<00:03:12.660> and

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
cycle it again becomes the wall and

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:23.059 
cycle it again becomes the wall and
green<00:03:14.819> becomes<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:22.380> that's<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.709> only<00:03:22.920> way

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
green becomes so that's the only way

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.000 
green becomes so that's the only way
that<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.310> could<00:03:23.370> get<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.850> work<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:25.049> think<00:03:25.650> that's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
that I could get the work I think that's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.069 
that I could get the work I think that's
a<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:27.139> creative<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:29.010> unique<00:03:29.780> way<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
a like really creative and unique way to

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.170 
a like really creative and unique way to
you<00:03:31.920> know<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.220> around<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.579> problems<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.060> I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
you know get around the problems that I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.160 
you know get around the problems that I
was<00:03:33.209> encountering<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.519> my<00:03:35.519> own<00:03:35.760> humble<00:03:36.359> expert

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
was encountering in my own humble expert

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.660 
was encountering in my own humble expert
opinion<00:03:37.709> haha<00:03:38.370> oh<00:03:39.709> yeah<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.980> over<00:03:44.099> here<00:03:44.130> is

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
the version that I was gonna work I'll

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.830 
the version that I was gonna work I'll
just<00:03:46.980> show<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.910> show<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.329> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
just show you this to show you the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.480 
just show you this to show you the
problem<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.530> encountering

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.000 

all<00:03:55.480> these<00:03:55.720> things<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.290> kind<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.680> didn't

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
all these things I just kind of didn't

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.850 
all these things I just kind of didn't
work<00:03:57.240> seamlessly<00:03:58.240> anymore<00:03:58.810> all<00:03:59.140> done<00:03:59.500> at<00:03:59.620> some

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
work seamlessly anymore all done at some

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.610 
work seamlessly anymore all done at some
point<00:04:00.070> kind<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.520> worked<00:04:00.700> but<00:04:01.030> once<00:04:01.990> I<00:04:02.170> moved<00:04:02.470> on

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
point kind of worked but once I moved on

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.470 
point kind of worked but once I moved on
to<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.890> next<00:04:03.160> version<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:04.030> just<00:04:04.210> kind<00:04:04.420> of

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
to the next version I just kind of

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.590 
to the next version I just kind of
gutted<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.020> last<00:04:05.260> one<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:05.950> science<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.570> I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
gutted the last one for science so I

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.480 
gutted the last one for science so I
could<00:04:07.870> figure<00:04:08.140> out<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.740> know<00:04:08.800> what<00:04:09.220> might<00:04:09.460> I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
could figure out you know what might I

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.530 
could figure out you know what might I
be<00:04:09.820> able<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.180> do<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.570> make<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.960> work

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
be able to do to make this work

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.880 
be able to do to make this work
eventually<00:04:13.540> turned<00:04:14.020> into<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.500> super<00:04:14.860> ray<00:04:16.890> so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
eventually turned into that super ray so

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.710 
eventually turned into that super ray so
you<00:04:17.980> can<00:04:18.100> see<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.520> opens<00:04:18.940> nice<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.690> easy<00:04:24.720> super

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
you can see it opens nice and easy super

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.380 
you can see it opens nice and easy super
clever<00:04:25.960> what<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.830> idea<00:04:27.790> because<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.150> worked

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
clever what this idea because it worked

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.450 
clever what this idea because it worked
with<00:04:28.660> just<00:04:28.930> one<00:04:29.170> next<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.830> each<00:04:29.950> other<00:04:30.160> like

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
with just one next to each other like

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.230 
with just one next to each other like
one<00:04:30.820> two<00:04:31.090> over<00:04:32.080> there<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.860> tried<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.670> do<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.940> for

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
one two over there I tried to do it for

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.560 
one two over there I tried to do it for
it<00:04:34.540> broke<00:04:34.870> them<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.340> was<00:04:36.460> demoralizing<00:04:37.060> and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
it broke them so I was demoralizing and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.590 
it broke them so I was demoralizing and
I<00:04:37.930> figured<00:04:38.470> out<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.530> whole<00:04:41.770> time<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:42.600> was

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
I figured out that this whole time I was

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.160 
I figured out that this whole time I was
using<00:04:43.840> these<00:04:44.140> fence<00:04:44.530> posts<00:04:45.720> or<00:04:46.720> those<00:04:46.900> fence

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
using these fence posts or those fence

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.790 
using these fence posts or those fence
gates<00:04:47.560> rather<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:49.150> they<00:04:49.960> weren't<00:04:50.260> necessary

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
gates rather and they weren't necessary

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.680 
gates rather and they weren't necessary
and<00:04:51.010> once<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.310> figured<00:04:51.700> that<00:04:51.730> out<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.330> actually

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
and once I figured that out it actually

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.480 
and once I figured that out it actually
opened<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.350> possibility<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.040> doing<00:04:54.340> this

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
opened up the possibility of doing this

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.080 
opened up the possibility of doing this
block<00:04:54.760> switching<00:04:55.590> concept<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.950> that's<00:04:57.850> what

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
block switching concept and that's what

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.570 
block switching concept and that's what
made<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.300> possible<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.170> I<00:04:59.740> just<00:05:00.100> really<00:05:00.400> loved

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
made it possible and I just really loved

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.450 
made it possible and I just really loved
how<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:00.820> turned<00:05:01.090> out<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.920> just<00:05:02.920> don't<00:05:03.100> think<00:05:03.370> it

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
how it turned out I just don't think it

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.840 
how it turned out I just don't think it
could<00:05:03.640> have<00:05:03.670> turned<00:05:04.120> out<00:05:04.330> any<00:05:04.360> better<00:05:05.850> I'm

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
could have turned out any better I'm

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.560 
could have turned out any better I'm
definitely<00:05:07.420> sure<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:08.620> this<00:05:09.430> can<00:05:09.670> be<00:05:09.850> made<00:05:10.150> a

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
definitely sure that this can be made a

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.040 
definitely sure that this can be made a
little<00:05:11.170> smaller<00:05:12.150> um<00:05:13.150> you<00:05:13.390> can<00:05:13.540> see<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:13.840> there

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
little smaller um you can see that there

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.290 
little smaller um you can see that there
is<00:05:14.200> actually<00:05:14.680> space<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:15.490> here<00:05:15.760> like<00:05:16.180> if

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
is actually space in here like if

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.940 
is actually space in here like if
there's<00:05:16.480> actually<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.840> lot<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.200> space<00:05:17.470> in<00:05:17.800> this

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
there's actually a lot of space in this

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.270 
there's actually a lot of space in this
whole<00:05:18.130> middle<00:05:18.460> part<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.780> then<00:05:20.230> also<00:05:20.440> I

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
whole middle part and then also I

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.100 
whole middle part and then also I
actually<00:05:21.670> did<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.030> little<00:05:22.180> bit<00:05:22.390> extra<00:05:22.690> wiring

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
actually did a little bit extra wiring

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.320 
actually did a little bit extra wiring
in<00:05:23.590> these<00:05:23.740> two<00:05:23.950> bottom<00:05:24.340> parts<00:05:24.670> this<00:05:24.820> red<00:05:25.120> and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
in these two bottom parts this red and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.680 
in these two bottom parts this red and
cyan<00:05:26.130> just<00:05:27.130> because<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.880> thought<00:05:28.210> I<00:05:28.270> needed

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
cyan just because I thought I needed

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.120 
cyan just because I thought I needed
something<00:05:29.070> but<00:05:30.070> I<00:05:30.130> really<00:05:30.160> didn't<00:05:31.020> so<00:05:32.130> these

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
something but I really didn't so these

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.410 
something but I really didn't so these
are<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.340> little<00:05:33.460> bigger<00:05:33.700> than<00:05:33.850> they<00:05:34.000> need<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.300> be

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
are a little bigger than they need to be

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.570 
are a little bigger than they need to be
and<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.470> can<00:05:35.620> actually<00:05:35.770> probably<00:05:36.190> be<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.310> three

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
and I can actually probably be a three

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.260 
and I can actually probably be a three
Tower<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.740> might<00:05:39.040> actually<00:05:39.250> build<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:40.060> better

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
Tower so I might actually build a better

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.000 
Tower so I might actually build a better
version<00:05:40.540> of<00:05:40.780> this<00:05:40.900> or<00:05:41.290> you<00:05:41.560> know<00:05:41.680> if<00:05:41.740> someone

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
version of this or you know if someone

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.290 
version of this or you know if someone
else<00:05:42.100> wants<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.550> build<00:05:42.730> a<00:05:42.820> better<00:05:43.000> version

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
else wants to build a better version

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.360 
else wants to build a better version
that's<00:05:43.900> awesome<00:05:44.380> too<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:46.680> also<00:05:47.680> one<00:05:48.160> thing

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
that's awesome too and also one thing

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.370 
that's awesome too and also one thing
that<00:05:48.640> I<00:05:48.700> do<00:05:48.760> have<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.150> concede<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.050> like

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
that I do have to concede that I like

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.200 
that I do have to concede that I like
about<00:05:50.500> cube<00:05:50.920> hamster's<00:05:51.370> version<00:05:51.760> better<00:05:51.910> is

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
about cube hamster's version better is

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.440 
about cube hamster's version better is
that<00:05:52.660> all<00:05:53.080> of<00:05:53.110> his<00:05:53.440> timing<00:05:54.070> is<00:05:54.460> built<00:05:54.940> into<00:05:55.330> his

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
that all of his timing is built into his

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.610 
that all of his timing is built into his
wiring<00:05:56.010> so<00:05:57.010> that's<00:05:57.430> really<00:05:57.760> cool<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.810> don't

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
wiring so that's really cool I don't

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.900 
wiring so that's really cool I don't
think<00:05:59.680> there's<00:05:59.920> any<00:06:00.070> way<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.220> can<00:06:00.400> do<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.550> with

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
think there's any way I can do that with

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.530 
think there's any way I can do that with
this<00:06:01.090> I<00:06:01.450> might<00:06:01.960> try<00:06:02.430> but<00:06:03.430> for<00:06:04.240> now<00:06:04.330> I'm<00:06:04.479> just

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
this I might try but for now I'm just

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.620 
this I might try but for now I'm just
really<00:06:04.810> happy<00:06:05.140> it<00:06:05.380> works

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
really happy it works

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.680 
really happy it works

so here's the deforest state and then
the<00:06:30.720> after<00:06:31.140> state<00:06:31.550> that's<00:06:32.550> what<00:06:32.760> I'm<00:06:32.850> gonna
