00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.539
 platforms 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.550

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 and these two bars will come out 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.220
 we have the language in which we want 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.890

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.230
 I will do so but you can 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.770
 modify to your liking 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.160
 we created quite a few games some are 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.680
 premieres others not but the most important 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.340
 that we can download to 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.470
 order through oj download created 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.430
 some games have the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.130
 j option 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.260
 download and we can also do 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.990
 direct downloads very well we have 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.590
 enough games and now we will enter 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.790
 some umbrellas such as special 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.790
 for example I will choose this 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.290
 and as you can see we have the option 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 d 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.010
 direct download through jacks 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.820
 download and download through tutors 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.930
 or towers 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:17.720
 and we can see a little trailer 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.990
 when we go down we have a trailer of him 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.530
 of our game and sometimes it can be a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.720
 gameplay jeter 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.180
 we also have the comments is very 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.650
 important because sometimes they come with 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.380
 some faults but it's also the creator 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.840
 or the person who uploaded it was some 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.170
 site made some arrangement for the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.500
 problem that came in handy now we're going 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.730
 what we live 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.980
 to create we will go to this box 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.600
 which says download torrents and click on 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.920
 the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 let's go there and start downloading 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.470
 our link is everything 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.510
 very well now what we will do is open 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.260
 our torrent 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.260
 by clicking on it 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.450
 let's go to our torrent link for 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.680
 course we have to have installed 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.420
 some server torrent 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.420
 I'm going to look for some video there 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.690
 here we have the tower link and it tells us 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.350
 how much our game weighs 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.060
 etcetera etcetera let's go ok if they want 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.690
 you can mark these two are links and things 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.720
 from the creator 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.330
 and we give what he 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.000
 and as you can see it has already begun to 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.640
 download 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.970
 this can vary the speed can 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.970
 to vary 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.510
 and that would be all if in suffering this dale 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.510
 on the button I like it on top
