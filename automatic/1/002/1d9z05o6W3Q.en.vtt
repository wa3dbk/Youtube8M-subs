00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
of them will score at the end of a round

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.770 
of them will score at the end of a round
first<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.939> these<00:01:55.939> cards<00:01:56.329> here<00:01:56.570> the

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
squid niggity and these simply score one

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.249 
squid niggity and these simply score one
two<00:02:03.409> or<00:02:03.770> three<00:02:04.130> points<00:02:04.520> easy<00:02:05.000> enough<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:06.170> you

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
two or three points easy enough then you

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.589 
two or three points easy enough then you
have<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.439> tempura<00:02:06.860> which<00:02:07.579> by<00:02:07.939> itself<00:02:08.360> is

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
have the tempura which by itself is

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.899 
have the tempura which by itself is
worth<00:02:08.869> nothing<00:02:09.379> but<00:02:09.890> if<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.099> get<00:02:10.250> two<00:02:10.579> of<00:02:10.610> them

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
worth nothing but if you get two of them

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.509 
worth nothing but if you get two of them
then<00:02:11.659> they're<00:02:11.870> worth<00:02:12.079> five<00:02:12.409> points<00:02:12.680> if<00:02:13.370> you

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
then they're worth five points if you

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.699 
then they're worth five points if you
get<00:02:13.609> three<00:02:13.909> of<00:02:13.999> them<00:02:14.150> well<00:02:14.719> still<00:02:15.290> worth<00:02:15.469> five

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
get three of them well still worth five

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.290 
get three of them well still worth five
points<00:02:15.889> because<00:02:16.159> you<00:02:16.249> need<00:02:16.370> matching<00:02:16.849> pairs

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
points because you need matching pairs

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.610 
points because you need matching pairs
if<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.630> get<00:02:17.750> four<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.110> you're<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.410> ten

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
if you get four then you're up to ten

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.230 
if you get four then you're up to ten
points<00:02:19.630> then<00:02:20.630> we<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:21.050> sashimi<00:02:22.000> which<00:02:23.000> is

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
points then we have sashimi which is

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.090 
points then we have sashimi which is
just<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> tempura<00:02:24.380> except<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.950> need

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
just like the tempura except you need

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.250 
just like the tempura except you need
three<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.640> them<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.300> work<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:27.170> this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
three of them for it to work and in this

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.760 
three of them for it to work and in this
case<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.710> get<00:02:27.950> ten<00:02:28.340> points<00:02:29.110> with<00:02:30.110> sushi

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
case so you get ten points with sushi

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.470 
case so you get ten points with sushi
rolls<00:02:31.040> you're<00:02:31.640> going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.940> count<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.450> number

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
rolls you're going to count the number

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.630 
rolls you're going to count the number
of<00:02:32.750> sushi<00:02:33.230> rolls<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:34.100> there's<00:02:34.400> one

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
of sushi rolls that you have there's one

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.550 
of sushi rolls that you have there's one
twos<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.090> threes<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> sushi<00:02:35.930> rolls<00:02:36.320> and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
twos and threes of the sushi rolls and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.920 
twos and threes of the sushi rolls and
whoever<00:02:37.340> has<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.670> most<00:02:37.850> sushi<00:02:38.150> rolls<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.660> six

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
whoever has the most sushi rolls get six

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.300 
whoever has the most sushi rolls get six
points<00:02:39.230> whoever<00:02:39.440> has<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> second-most<00:02:40.010> gets

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
points whoever has the second-most gets

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.280 
points whoever has the second-most gets
three<00:02:40.730> points<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.510> those<00:02:41.750> points<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.260> be

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
three points and those points can be

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.260 
three points and those points can be
split<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:42.980> here<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:43.250> six<00:02:43.670> sushi<00:02:44.030> rolls

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
split so here I have six sushi rolls

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.950 
split so here I have six sushi rolls
perhaps<00:02:44.990> that's<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> most<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.710> get<00:02:45.860> points

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
perhaps that's the most to get points

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.280 
perhaps that's the most to get points
dumplings<00:02:47.960> one<00:02:48.650> dumpling<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.780> 1.2<00:02:50.780> dumplings

5<00:02:55.160> are<00:02:55.460> worth<00:02:55.670> 15<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.960> those<00:02:57.140> are<00:02:57.170> useful<00:02:57.620> in

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
5 are worth 15 so those are useful in

nigga D card on it after in the future

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.150 
nigga D card on it after in the future
which<00:03:14.480> will<00:03:14.720> then<00:03:14.870> multiply<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.650> times

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
which will then multiply that times

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.490
