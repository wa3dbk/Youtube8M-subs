00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
I know quite a few of you guys are

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.940 
I know quite a few of you guys are
waiting<00:00:07.790> on<00:00:08.059> this<00:00:08.299> tutorial<00:00:08.600> I<00:00:09.200> was<00:00:09.650> hoping<00:00:09.889> to

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
waiting on this tutorial I was hoping to

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.850 
waiting on this tutorial I was hoping to
make<00:00:10.219> this<00:00:10.370> really<00:00:10.670> short<00:00:11.120> but<00:00:11.929> I<00:00:12.170> decided<00:00:12.559> to

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
make this really short but I decided to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.680 
make this really short but I decided to
break<00:00:13.070> it<00:00:13.190> down<00:00:13.219> into<00:00:13.610> different<00:00:13.760> parts<00:00:14.330> so

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
break it down into different parts so

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.650 
break it down into different parts so
that<00:00:14.870> I<00:00:14.900> won't<00:00:15.139> confuse<00:00:15.620> you<00:00:15.830> guys<00:00:16.450> so<00:00:17.450> for

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
that I won't confuse you guys so for

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.210 
that I won't confuse you guys so for
this<00:00:17.779> week<00:00:18.080> which<00:00:18.439> is<00:00:18.590> gonna<00:00:18.770> learn<00:00:19.070> how<00:00:19.190> to

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
this week which is gonna learn how to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.090 
this week which is gonna learn how to
make<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:19.730> face<00:00:19.940> I<00:00:20.350> hope<00:00:21.350> you<00:00:21.500> guys<00:00:21.680> will

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
make the face I hope you guys will

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.830 
make the face I hope you guys will
follow<00:00:22.340> along<00:00:22.730> in<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.150> next<00:00:23.330> few<00:00:23.630> weeks

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
follow along in the next few weeks

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.380 
follow along in the next few weeks
because<00:00:24.410> if<00:00:24.740> you<00:00:24.890> try<00:00:25.100> to<00:00:25.160> make<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.640> all<00:00:25.789> in<00:00:25.910> one

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
because if you try to make it all in one

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.189 
because if you try to make it all in one
sitting<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:27.230> gets<00:00:27.470> very<00:00:27.590> frustrating<00:00:29.199> so

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
sitting it gets very frustrating so

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.140 
sitting it gets very frustrating so
let's<00:00:30.439> begin<00:00:30.619> first<00:00:31.430> we're<00:00:31.670> going<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.910> learn<00:00:32.090> a

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
let's begin first we're going to learn a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.880 
let's begin first we're going to learn a
little<00:00:32.599> bit<00:00:32.689> about<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.170> materials<00:00:33.710> that

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
little bit about the materials that

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.490 
little bit about the materials that
we're<00:00:34.070> gonna<00:00:34.190> use<00:00:34.630> the<00:00:35.630> main<00:00:35.809> beads<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:36.380> I'm

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
we're gonna use the main beads that I'm

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
we're gonna use the main beads that I'm
using<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.340> 3<00:00:37.579> millimeter<00:00:37.850> bicone<00:00:38.750> beads

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
using is the 3 millimeter bicone beads

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.889 
using is the 3 millimeter bicone beads
here<00:00:40.520> is<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.850> amount<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.300> beads<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:41.840> you

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
here is the amount of beads that you

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.080 
here is the amount of beads that you
will<00:00:42.200> need<00:00:42.410> if<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.129> missed<00:00:43.399> out<00:00:43.579> don't<00:00:43.850> worry

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
will need if you missed out don't worry

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.940 
will need if you missed out don't worry
I<00:00:44.180> will<00:00:44.480> post<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.110> info<00:00:45.469> box

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
I will post it in the info box

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.160 
I will post it in the info box
the<00:00:46.129> tiny<00:00:46.370> bee<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:46.760> about<00:00:47.090> 1<00:00:47.390> millimeter<00:00:47.719> it

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
the tiny bee is about 1 millimeter it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.020 
the tiny bee is about 1 millimeter it
doesn't<00:00:48.530> exactly<00:00:48.920> have<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.460> be<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:49.760> size

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
doesn't exactly have to be that size

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.880 
doesn't exactly have to be that size
just<00:00:50.059> needs<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.870> be<00:00:51.020> smaller<00:00:51.350> than<00:00:51.620> 3

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
just needs to be smaller than 3

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.430 
just needs to be smaller than 3
millimeter<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.030> best<00:00:53.360> beading<00:00:53.840> wire<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.260> use

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
millimeter the best beading wire to use

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.580 
millimeter the best beading wire to use
is<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:55.100> fishing<00:00:55.610> line<00:00:55.660> it's<00:00:56.660> clear<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:57.440> it

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
is this fishing line it's clear so it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.380 
is this fishing line it's clear so it
would<00:00:57.710> not<00:00:57.890> show<00:00:58.129> up<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.520> body<00:00:58.789> of<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.149> sea

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
would not show up in the body of the sea

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.119 
would not show up in the body of the sea
line<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.260> for<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.500> purpose<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:01.010> this

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
line but for the purpose of this

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.250 
line but for the purpose of this
tutorial<00:01:01.579> I'm<00:01:01.969> gonna<00:01:02.210> use<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:02.750> metal<00:01:03.230> wire

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
tutorial I'm gonna use this metal wire

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.310 
tutorial I'm gonna use this metal wire
so<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:03.890> can<00:01:04.160> see<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.520> wire<00:01:04.930> well<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:06.080> basically

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
so you can see the wire well I basically

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.280 
so you can see the wire well I basically
loop<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.310> wire<00:01:07.520> on<00:01:07.820> my<00:01:08.000> hands<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:08.510> 15<00:01:08.960> times

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
loop the wire on my hands for 15 times

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.320 
loop the wire on my hands for 15 times
because<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.250> want<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.670> have<00:01:10.820> more<00:01:11.119> material

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
because you want to have more material

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.220 
because you want to have more material
to<00:01:11.689> work<00:01:11.990> with<00:01:12.290> than<00:01:12.619> less

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.400 

now<00:01:17.230> go<00:01:17.470> ahead<00:01:17.530> grab<00:01:17.920> one<00:01:18.190> end<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.820> wired

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
now go ahead grab one end of the wired

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.120 
now go ahead grab one end of the wired
your<00:01:20.410> first<00:01:20.740> B<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.340> going<00:01:21.730> to<00:01:21.790> be<00:01:21.850> black<00:01:23.130> then

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
your first B is going to be black then

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.190 
your first B is going to be black then
you're<00:01:24.460> gonna<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:24.850> five<00:01:25.270> more<00:01:25.600> main<00:01:25.900> color

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
you're gonna have five more main color

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.200 
you're gonna have five more main color
beam<00:01:26.500> which<00:01:27.190> I<00:01:27.490> choose<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.390> use<00:01:28.600> blue<00:01:28.930> color<00:01:30.210> go

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
beam which I choose to use blue color go

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.120 
beam which I choose to use blue color go
ahead<00:01:31.420> pull<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.840> beads<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.650> center<00:01:32.950> of

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
ahead pull the beads to the center of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.470 
ahead pull the beads to the center of
the<00:01:33.340> wire

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.270 

grab<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.630> wire<00:01:37.840> that's<00:01:38.110> opposite<00:01:38.860> from<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
grab the wire that's opposite from the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.610 
grab the wire that's opposite from the
black<00:01:39.520> bead<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.120> then<00:01:40.600> crisscross<00:01:41.320> it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
black bead and then crisscross it

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.940 
black bead and then crisscross it
through<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.100> black<00:01:42.490> bean<00:01:43.440> okay<00:01:44.440> now<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.800> just

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
through the black bean okay now you just

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.100 
through the black bean okay now you just
make<00:01:45.370> your<00:01:45.520> first<00:01:45.730> loop<00:01:46.030> remember<00:01:46.900> this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
make your first loop remember this

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.780 
make your first loop remember this
technique<00:01:47.590> because<00:01:47.950> we're<00:01:48.190> essentially

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
technique because we're essentially

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.820 
technique because we're essentially
gonna<00:01:49.120> use<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.570> same<00:01:49.840> thing<00:01:50.140> over<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.770> over

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
gonna use the same thing over and over

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.150 
gonna use the same thing over and over
again<00:01:51.250> at<00:01:51.940> this<00:01:52.180> angle<00:01:52.420> graph<00:01:53.290> your<00:01:53.530> left<00:01:53.800> wire

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
again at this angle graph your left wire

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.460 
again at this angle graph your left wire
and<00:01:54.550> this<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.330> where<00:01:55.660> you're<00:01:55.870> gonna<00:01:55.960> add<00:01:56.200> on

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
and this is where you're gonna add on

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.770 
and this is where you're gonna add on
the<00:01:56.710> beads<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.700> always<00:01:57.940> want<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.240> add<00:01:58.300> on<00:01:58.600> the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
the beads you always want to add on the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.510 
the beads you always want to add on the
base<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.320> left<00:01:59.680> wire<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.250> then

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
base to the left wire and then

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.670 
base to the left wire and then
crisscross<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.540> bright<00:02:01.900> two<00:02:02.140> wire<00:02:02.320> on

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
crisscross it with a bright two wire on

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.770 
crisscross it with a bright two wire on
the<00:02:03.220> second<00:02:03.640> loop<00:02:03.760> you're<00:02:04.030> gonna<00:02:04.150> have<00:02:04.390> five

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
the second loop you're gonna have five

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.190 
the second loop you're gonna have five
main<00:02:05.080> color<00:02:05.410> beads<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:07.390> second<00:02:07.780> loop<00:02:07.990> is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
main color beads your second loop is

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.560 
main color beads your second loop is
basically<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.070> first<00:02:09.310> loop<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.149> second

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
basically the first loop of the second

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.940 
basically the first loop of the second
row<00:02:12.570> now<00:02:13.570> you're<00:02:13.750> gonna<00:02:13.870> take<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.350> right<00:02:14.620> wire

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
row now you're gonna take the right wire

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.840 
row now you're gonna take the right wire
and<00:02:15.340> then<00:02:15.670> crisscross<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.510> at<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.900> last<00:02:17.140> bead

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and then crisscross it at the last bead

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.060 
and then crisscross it at the last bead
once<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.030> crisscross<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.810> bead<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.709> right

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
once you crisscross the bead your right

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430 
once you crisscross the bead your right
wire<00:02:21.340> became<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.120> left<00:02:22.330> wire<00:02:22.630> for<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.080> next

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
wire became the left wire for the next

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.490 
wire became the left wire for the next
loop<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:24.580> see<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:25.090> B<00:02:25.390> right<00:02:25.780> next<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.350> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
loop you see that B right next to the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.280 
loop you see that B right next to the
last<00:02:26.680> cross<00:02:27.070> bead<00:02:27.400> take<00:02:28.150> your<00:02:28.360> white<00:02:28.630> wire<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
last cross bead take your white wire and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.230 
last cross bead take your white wire and
thread<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.860> through<00:02:32.520> now<00:02:33.520> you're<00:02:33.730> ready<00:02:33.940> to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
thread it through now you're ready to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.760 
thread it through now you're ready to
make<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.630> second<00:02:35.110> loop<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.800> second<00:02:36.250> row

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
make the second loop on the second row

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.160 
make the second loop on the second row
take<00:02:38.770> your<00:02:38.950> left<00:02:39.160> wire<00:02:39.459> add<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:40.510> black<00:02:40.840> bead

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
take your left wire add one black bead

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:51.840 
take your left wire add one black bead
and<00:02:41.410> two<00:02:42.220> main<00:02:42.880> color<00:02:43.150> beads

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:05.339 

then<00:02:52.850> crisscross<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.720> using<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.320> white<00:02:54.560> wire

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.410 

see<00:03:06.349> how<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.590> have<00:03:06.920> two<00:03:07.190> loops<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.030> second

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
see how you have two loops on the second

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.289 
see how you have two loops on the second
row<00:03:09.159> are<00:03:10.159> you<00:03:10.280> gonna<00:03:10.430> take<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.849> white<00:03:11.000> wire

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
row are you gonna take the white wire

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.880 
row are you gonna take the white wire
and<00:03:11.510> thread<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.049> through<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.409> next<00:03:12.560> bead

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
and thread it through the next bead

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.270 
and thread it through the next bead
again

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.510 

take<00:03:19.940> your<00:03:20.120> left<00:03:20.300> wire<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.900> F<00:03:21.140> form<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:22.040> colored

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
take your left wire and F form a colored

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:33.170 
take your left wire and F form a colored
piece

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.620 

crisscross<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.450> loop<00:03:34.659> using<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> white<00:03:35.500> wire

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.460 

and<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:40.580> is<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.030> third<00:03:41.270> loop<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.080> second

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
and this is the third loop on the second

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.730 
and this is the third loop on the second
row<00:03:43.630> yep<00:03:44.630> you're<00:03:44.900> doing<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> same<00:03:45.530> thing

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
row yep you're doing the same thing

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.010 
row yep you're doing the same thing
again<00:03:45.890> he's<00:03:46.640> taking<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> right<00:03:47.360> wire<00:03:47.660> and

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
again he's taking the right wire and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.560 
again he's taking the right wire and
thread<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.470> through<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.800> next<00:03:48.950> bead<00:03:49.570> now

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
thread it through the next bead now

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.660 
thread it through the next bead now
we're<00:03:50.810> ready<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.170> make<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.770> fourth<00:03:52.130> loop<00:03:52.400> on

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
we're ready to make the fourth loop on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.800 
we're ready to make the fourth loop on
the<00:03:52.910> second<00:03:53.330> row<00:03:54.700> take<00:03:55.700> your<00:03:55.850> left<00:03:56.030> wire<00:03:56.330> again

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
the second row take your left wire again

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.670 
the second row take your left wire again
and<00:03:57.080> add<00:03:57.350> on<00:03:57.590> three<00:03:57.980> main<00:03:58.220> color<00:03:58.520> beads<00:03:59.680> you're

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
and add on three main color beads you're

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.560 
and add on three main color beads you're
essentially<00:04:01.130> using<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.880> same<00:04:02.150> technique

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
essentially using the same technique

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.050 
essentially using the same technique
over<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.230> over<00:04:03.470> again<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.490> gotta<00:04:04.790> make

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
over and over again but you gotta make

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
over and over again but you gotta make
sure<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.540> use<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.020> right<00:04:06.230> amount<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.830> B<00:04:06.980> in

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
sure you use the right amount of B in

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.500 
sure you use the right amount of B in

readable once you crisscross the B
you're<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:12.050> make<00:04:12.290> this<00:04:12.530> fourth<00:04:12.860> loop<00:04:13.160> on<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
you're just make this fourth loop on the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.420 
you're just make this fourth loop on the

you're<00:05:00.650> doing<00:05:00.950> right<00:05:01.130> now<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.580> basically

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
you're doing right now is basically

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.450 
you're doing right now is basically
closing<00:05:02.540> up<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.140> second<00:05:03.590> row<00:05:06.250> once<00:05:07.250> you

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
closing up the second row once you

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.310 
closing up the second row once you
thread<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.910> right<00:05:08.120> wire<00:05:08.390> through<00:05:08.810> both<00:05:09.080> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
thread the right wire through both the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.520 
thread the right wire through both the
beads<00:05:10.060> now<00:05:11.060> you're<00:05:11.270> ready<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.690> make<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.930> sixth

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
beads now you're ready to make the sixth

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.300 
beads now you're ready to make the sixth
and<00:05:12.680> last<00:05:12.710> loop<00:05:13.460> for<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.940> second<00:05:14.360> row<00:05:15.310> first

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
and last loop for the second row first

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.880 
and last loop for the second row first
you're<00:05:16.580> gonna<00:05:16.700> insert<00:05:17.150> one<00:05:17.450> main<00:05:17.780> bead<00:05:18.110> then

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
you're gonna insert one main bead then

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.399 
you're gonna insert one main bead then
you're<00:05:19.130> gonna<00:05:19.250> add<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:19.760> one<00:05:20.150> black<00:05:20.540> bean

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.040 

now<00:05:26.309> you<00:05:26.369> can<00:05:26.699> crisscross<00:05:26.999> the<00:05:27.539> right<00:05:27.779> wire

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
now you can crisscross the right wire

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.570 
now you can crisscross the right wire
through<00:05:28.529> the<00:05:28.649> black<00:05:28.889> bead<00:05:31.069> once<00:05:32.069> you<00:05:32.219> pull<00:05:32.399> it

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
through the black bead once you pull it

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.489 
through the black bead once you pull it
tight<00:05:32.729> you<00:05:32.789> should<00:05:33.239> be<00:05:33.330> able<00:05:33.509> to<00:05:33.719> see<00:05:34.019> the<00:05:34.229> nose

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499 
tight you should be able to see the nose

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.359 
tight you should be able to see the nose
in<00:05:34.889> the<00:05:35.099> eyes<00:05:35.249> of<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.789> sea<00:05:35.969> lion<00:05:37.159> you<00:05:38.159> should

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:38.369 
in the eyes of the sea lion you should

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:40.189 
in the eyes of the sea lion you should
see<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.699> as<00:05:38.849> a<00:05:38.879> center<00:05:39.269> circle<00:05:39.659> and<00:05:39.929> then<00:05:40.050> the

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
see it as a center circle and then the

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.169 
see it as a center circle and then the
sixth<00:05:40.559> loop<00:05:40.769> surrounding<00:05:41.459> the<00:05:41.610> center<00:05:41.939> circle

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:42.179 
sixth loop surrounding the center circle

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.689 
sixth loop surrounding the center circle
if<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.139> see<00:05:43.499> that<00:05:43.679> then<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.069> are<00:05:44.399> finished

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
if you see that then you are finished

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.859 
if you see that then you are finished
for<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.419> first<00:05:45.629> part<00:05:46.849> so<00:05:47.849> for<00:05:48.089> next<00:05:48.330> week<00:05:48.629> I'm

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:48.869 
for the first part so for next week I'm

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:50.359 
for the first part so for next week I'm
going<00:05:49.019> to<00:05:49.110> show<00:05:49.259> you<00:05:49.289> guys<00:05:49.559> how<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:49.860> make<00:05:50.039> the

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:50.369 
going to show you guys how to make the

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:53.269 
going to show you guys how to make the
flippers<00:05:50.789> it<00:05:51.479> gets<00:05:52.110> a<00:05:52.409> little<00:05:52.739> bit<00:05:53.069> more

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
flippers it gets a little bit more

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.939 
flippers it gets a little bit more
complicated<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:54.209> think<00:05:55.080> it's<00:05:55.199> a<00:05:55.289> good<00:05:55.409> idea<00:05:55.769> to

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
complicated I think it's a good idea to

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.799 
complicated I think it's a good idea to
break<00:05:56.099> it<00:05:56.279> down<00:05:56.309> into<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.849> few<00:05:57.029> parts<00:05:57.239> so<00:05:57.629> that

00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:57.809 
break it down into a few parts so that

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.519 
break it down into a few parts so that
it's<00:05:57.929> not<00:05:58.169> also<00:05:58.349> warming<00:05:58.860> for<00:05:59.039> you<00:05:59.189> guys<00:05:59.369> I

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
it's not also warming for you guys I

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.100 
it's not also warming for you guys I
