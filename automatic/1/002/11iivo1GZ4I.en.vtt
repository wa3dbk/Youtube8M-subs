 paduano at the start of race 1 is really 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.910
 the number 69 to take the lead but 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.440
 Russian is not there and already during the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.110
 first lap in conquering the leadership 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.800
 first paduan and then red them in half 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.200
 the group is torn up and created 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.970
 two trios of the master mendau and baldi 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.340
 they fight for fourth place while 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 in front of Russian and Paduan melon yes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 they play the victory after continuous exchanges 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.369
 of position to check melon that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.310
 on the last turn passes the Russian saint with 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 paduano third in race 2 padulano takes off 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 great followed by Russian saint and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.640
 the master positions are stable until 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 fifth round when Russian takes the wake 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.550
 of the leader of the race slipping in 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.920
 back to the straight 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.780
 behind them and great fight between dances 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.290
 morelli and marco russo for the fifth 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 square 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.610
 two laps later Paduan overtakes 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.160
 new Russian saint while melon and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.280
 permanently third with a last epic 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.660
 round made of overtaking counter-passages 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.860
 Paduan manages to impose itself on the red with 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.929
 melon that closes third 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.460
 the sum of marshalls and the podium a 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.460
 melon and Russian paduan 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.310
 the first run but it went a little bad 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.530
 because we had some engine losses 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.450
 the second we've fixed me 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.050
 I felt with a great feeling with it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
 scooter 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.539
 in fact the last last lap last 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.450
 curve was just awesome 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.130
 I really dedicate a really great race 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.040
 to the team and who loves me 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 the scootermatic south of the first row 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.270
 composed of real and royal gargoyle 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.770
 coviello at the start of the first final 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.290
 he thinks about a few drops of rain 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.390
 mix the cards during the first rounds 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.459
 the glides of some pilots induce a 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.620
 race director expose red flag 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.630
 before the break they were 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.519
 alternated with the judo area command command 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.620
 and after the second start the situation 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.050
 little changes so in the end gargiulo yes 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.180
 imposes on real race in race 2 after the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.519
 anticipated departure of adinolfi punished 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.470
 with 30 seconds of penalty is a group 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.660
 of seven pilots and take the head e 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 more coriaceous prove to be gargiulo 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.410
 coviello reale scarpa and of urso 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.850
 reached takes the lead and holds it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.590
 up to two laps from the end 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.269
 the struggle is so tight that often i 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.790
 head pilots touch on the bottom of the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.500
 straight to tick the real with 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.239
 gargiulo and coviello that fail 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.400
 also enter the podium go up 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.950
 royal gargoyle 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.140
 race 1, even if it is less real 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.819
 made from cork it is able to arrive 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.220
 first race 2 I was wrong at the start 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.930
 but a refit and I arrived 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.879
 second 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.760
 absolute first to thank friends 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.189
 who follow me is my mechanic 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.379
 He has put the soul to the engine and there 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:34.299
 we succeeded in bari 1 yes it is arrived 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.510
 very strong of the previous curve yes 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.000
 slightly usually spring do not touch 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.180
 the brakes to then accelerate everything and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.060
 make cheaters 2 in full who goes faster 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.940
 does the time and must delay a little 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.070
 entry to do 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.080
 to succeed in fast then on the straight her 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.390
 it is widening towards the curb side 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.560
 left and tightening towards the curb 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.870
 right side 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.410
 the important thing is to get out of it full fast 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.690
 to exploit or there is or full straight 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.640
 so as not to keep the laps down 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 bike and try to do the maximum 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.770
 speed 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.250
 these two curves of the track are 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.320
 fundamental because they are enough are 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.000
 exciting and there we do say the 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.799
 unlike other businesses 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.600
 one with the fifth barrel with the fifth 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.630
 arrivals at the finish line puts the head e 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.100
 it ends but I am still you don't owe yourself 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.620
 interview other people who go 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.700
 out 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.940
 I think it's the point where the is done 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.090
 time is the point is difficult is easy 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.070
 getting out is easy to lose the line 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.330
 I still have to work bari 1 bari 2 se 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.420
 no place with the suspension is 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.080
 very difficult is there that makes time 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.080
 now I run away to enter 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.690
 in the stock 80 mastrosimone signs the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.790
 pole position ahead for the grino 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.889
 good and bearded at the start of the race 1 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.960
 pilgrim and mastrosimone take the 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.000
 command with bearded that keeps in 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.530
 wake the two leading pilots fighting 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.509
 tenaciously but this favors 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.490
 the experienced bearded jenny who slowly 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.500
 recovers ground during the race 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.180
 definitively reducing the tear 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.919
 on the last lap it is the last one 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.990
 return that mastrosimone is looking for 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.539
 overtaking on pilgrimage to the hairpin but 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.100
 the reigning champion passes in front 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.930
 favoring the inclusion of bearded that 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.650
 thus conquers the second place on the 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.750
 Mastrosimone 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.820
 race 2 is very tight from the first 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.190
 on the last lap after losing in the 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.110
 first phases chianese barbato the latter 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.419
 slipped is forced to chase the 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.400
 head group sees simone pilgrim 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.350
 fight with mastrosimone good 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.150
 the three make a race all their own up 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.250
 on the last lap when good returns 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.169
 below together with mastrosimone induces 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.539
 Salerno to the pilgrim mistake 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.849
 slips wins so mastrosimone on good 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.410
 and Greek on the podium go mastrosimone 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.410
 good and pilgrim 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.510
 yes it was a very difficult race 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.280
 why 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.560
 I must say that according to pilgrim state 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.610
 we are very fast on this track 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.140
 came on a Friday we shot a little 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.340
 then you know we shot and Sunday 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.590
 we had a good race I have to 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:11.080
