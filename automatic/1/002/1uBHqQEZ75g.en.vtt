00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.970
 a 70 and I have one again 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330
 thank God for the topic 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.280
 currently was still asked yes 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.269
 How do I get in the app cities 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.030
 or how do I do that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.970
 is visible at all and I show 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.910
 now generally in general 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 generally as a couple says or does 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 two tools of windows one the one 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
 sometimes make life easier 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.750
 and there are so-called 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.809
 hidden folder in windows that is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.790
 all that you see here is also 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.920
 on my hard drive on it however 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 are there more files and there are 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 yet another trick or 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.890
 and there is something else and that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.590
 that one always opens me the thing 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 minecraft points or opens the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 minecraft points or white I know 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 not what and when you normally 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 has any files on your pc 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.920
 and is not converted then it means 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 the file mostly i have here now 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.719
 created here it is testing he stands there 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 are not active but we see here on 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.610
 Type it is a txt file and around that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 There is a need to blind a whole one 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.810
 not really much we just go 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.520
 Organize here on this button 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.270
 go to folders and search options and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 on view and now something comes down 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.409
 and here are some used 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 hooks that means extensions 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.170
 Hide known file types 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.840
 that means that bethesda the same with 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.570
 the point ticks the three tuned it so 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
 I took it over and tested text yes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.329
 is now so and now for those 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 who still want to see the appdata folder 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.780
 where your point minecraft ortner is the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.729
 scroll down a bit and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.229
 here are hidden files and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.729
 folder what I mentioned earlier 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.009
 and here he sits in front of the hook 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.450
 The lower one now click on Apply 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.869
 and we see three or more on the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.149
 windows directory now or on the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.100
 normal cd carrier at your program there 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.930
 Of course, synonymous of windows or 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.290
 most of it is actually everything 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.240
 windows i would not necessarily 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 recommend to change something because of this 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.209
 not for nothing hidden hidden 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 Folders are usually always 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.730
 just for the people a bit 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.099
 know more about computers if 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.409
 Well, I'm not saying that yet 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.580
 many computer knows then I want that 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.730
 hide it all again later 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.769
 as soon as you minecraft 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.870
 So I'm under for my part now 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.549
 User and we will see one again 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.569
 other folder that is the result but 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.129
 that does not matter 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.890
 but you can see that we are so light 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.360
 is faded because we go to each one 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.900
 case in our in our users 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.340
 directory and here we have it now 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.780
 to see and now we have the roaming 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.349
 car and get around minecraft 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.519
 but when we finally get down to words 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.739
 percent indicated 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.910
 now we come in any case, then, it 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.410
 does not matter whether we folder one 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.900
 have winning or hidden 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.060
 once we have percent off tata percent 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.410
 enter does not matter 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.810
 We will definitely be in this 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.129
 folder it is only if you are somewhere in 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.239
 any installation 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.709
 installation weighs in this folder 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.140
 then you have to choose over 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.910
 user username and then appdata 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.349
 go and if so as I said is too 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.940
 a folder that is actually hidden 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.280
 if you are not displayed 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.720
 then of course that's difficult 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.310
 click on it and then say yes 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.790
 and install the internet data 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.180
 roaming so far in the case so far like that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.500
 can apply all directly again and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.410
 i would say for the people that 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.079
 I really do say of myself 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.090
 not so much about computers that stay 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.680
 then just go or they will go 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.450
 Just click here on the setting and 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.519
 then go here also hidden 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.989
 Files folder, click Do not Show 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.780
 just take over then that's it 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.609
 away again as the best but already 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.609
 Thank you for listening and goodbye
