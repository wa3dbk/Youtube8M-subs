miles i topped the gas off in mason and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
miles i topped the gas off in mason and
we're<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> fill<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> back<00:01:27.300> up<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we're going to fill it back up in

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.499 
we're going to fill it back up in
napoleon<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> find<00:01:30.390> out

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
napoleon and I'm going to find out

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.120 
napoleon and I'm going to find out
exactly<00:01:31.200> how<00:01:31.409> much<00:01:31.470> gas<00:01:31.800> i<00:01:32.040> burned<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:34.130> how

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
exactly how much gas i burned and how

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.290 
exactly how much gas i burned and how
many<00:01:35.280> miles<00:01:35.490> per<00:01:35.850> gallon<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:37.020> getting<00:01:38.300> now

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
many miles per gallon I'm getting now

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.400 
many miles per gallon I'm getting now
normally<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.960> car<00:01:40.350> gets<00:01:40.649> up<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.479> 38<00:01:42.479> miles<00:01:42.899> per

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
normally the car gets up to 38 miles per

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.740 
normally the car gets up to 38 miles per
gallon<00:01:43.649> highway<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> i<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.820> generators

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
gallon highway so i got my generators

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
gallon highway so i got my generators
filled<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.759> put<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> filler<00:01:51.090> plugs<00:01:51.509> in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
filled up put the filler plugs in

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.500 
filled up put the filler plugs in
then<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> car<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.880> powered<00:01:57.330> up

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
then I got in the car and I powered up

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.030 
then I got in the car and I powered up
the<00:01:57.720> generators<00:01:58.880> started<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> engine<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the generators started the engine and it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.440 
the generators started the engine and it
ran<00:02:02.160> pretty<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.730> we<00:02:05.730> went<00:02:05.940> out<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
ran pretty good so we went out on the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.480 
ran pretty good so we went out on the
highway<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.460> topped<00:02:08.460> it<00:02:08.580> off<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.790> gas<00:02:09.210> and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
highway and topped it off with gas and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.340 
highway and topped it off with gas and
headed<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.520> home

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.220 

not<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> highway<00:02:17.850> began<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.780> sputter<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
not on the highway began to sputter a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
not on the highway began to sputter a
little<00:02:19.530> bit<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.340> stop<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.970> checked

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
little bit and when we stop I checked

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.980 
little bit and when we stop I checked
the<00:02:25.340> filter<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.550> found<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.090> indeed<00:02:27.570> some

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the filter and found that indeed some

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.950 
the filter and found that indeed some
water<00:02:28.230> had<00:02:28.530> gotten<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.600> I'm<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> have

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
water had gotten in so I'm going to have

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.900 
water had gotten in so I'm going to have
to<00:02:31.020> build<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.320> water<00:02:31.500> trap<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.310> stop<00:02:32.580> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.630 

but<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> encouraging<00:02:37.140> thing<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:38.070> when<00:02:38.610> I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
but the encouraging thing is that when I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.309 
but the encouraging thing is that when I
check<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> mileage

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
check the mileage

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.240 
check the mileage
I<00:02:41.409> was<00:02:41.950> getting<00:02:42.719> 48<00:02:43.719> miles

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
I was getting 48 miles

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.520 
I was getting 48 miles
and<00:02:46.210> what<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.540> saw<00:02:46.780> there's<00:02:47.080> well

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and what you just saw there's well

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.200 
power was on to the generators we're
traveling<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.210> 70<00:02:55.630> miles<00:02:55.810> per<00:02:56.170> hour

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.450 

and<00:03:01.480> aside<00:03:01.990> from<00:03:02.020> getting<00:03:02.410> them<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.890> little<00:03:03.250> bit

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
and aside from getting them a little bit

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.800 
and aside from getting them a little bit
of<00:03:03.580> water

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
of water

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.590 
of water
coming<00:03:05.500> through<00:03:05.910> engine<00:03:06.910> ran<00:03:07.090> very<00:03:07.390> smoothly

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.020 

so<00:03:13.230> I'm<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.970> make<00:03:14.970> some

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
so I'm going to have to make some

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.350 
so I'm going to have to make some
modifications

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.890 

try<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.110> experiment<00:03:19.800> all<00:03:20.520> over<00:03:20.910> again<00:03:21.150> but

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
try this experiment all over again but

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.570 
try this experiment all over again but
48<00:03:22.290> miles<00:03:22.740> per<00:03:23.070> gallon<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.640> very<00:03:24.330> good
