as well when I use it on my waterline

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.160 
as well when I use it on my waterline
cuz<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.409> simply<00:01:38.740> just<00:01:38.770> go<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.689> just<00:01:40.960> kind

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
of touch it in and draw it in because

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.060 
of touch it in and draw it in because

it's so soft it takes a very little
effort<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.729> do<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.659> I<00:01:46.750> won't<00:01:46.899> put<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.110> clip

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
effort to do this and I won't put a clip

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.380 
effort to do this and I won't put a clip
in<00:01:47.380> here<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.829> how<00:01:47.979> I<00:01:48.009> apply<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.700> how<00:01:48.909> I<00:01:48.939> apply<00:01:49.329> it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
in here of how I apply it how I apply it

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.959 
in here of how I apply it how I apply it
but<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:50.680> takes<00:01:50.890> very<00:01:51.130> little<00:01:51.280> effort<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.850> do

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
but it takes very little effort to do

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.520 
but it takes very little effort to do
this<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.509> mean<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.659> was<00:01:52.990> basically<00:01:53.290> how<00:01:53.500> I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
this and I mean that was basically how I

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.510 
this and I mean that was basically how I
apply<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:53.950> right<00:01:54.250> uh-huh

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
apply it right uh-huh

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.410 
apply it right uh-huh
so<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.979> have<00:01:57.100> asked<00:01:57.399> me<00:01:57.520> how<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.729> get<00:01:57.969> it<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.360> it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
so they have asked me how I get it so it

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
so they have asked me how I get it so it
doesn't<00:01:58.570> transfer<00:01:59.049> down<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.409> my<00:01:59.530> bottom

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
doesn't transfer down to my bottom

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.950 
doesn't transfer down to my bottom
waterline<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.149> what<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.270> do<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.570> wanted<00:02:01.840> two

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
waterline and what I do is wanted two

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.490 
waterline and what I do is wanted two
things<00:02:02.170> either<00:02:02.409> I<00:02:02.590> put<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:04.170> cream<00:02:05.170> colored

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
things either I put a cream colored

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.830 
things either I put a cream colored
liner<00:02:05.740> there<00:02:06.009> first<00:02:06.340> or<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:07.000> honestly<00:02:07.570> what<00:02:07.810> I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
liner there first or I honestly what I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.840 
liner there first or I honestly what I
tend<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.289> do<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.770> put<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.070> on<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.460> then<00:02:09.820> I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
tend to do is I put it on and then I

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.040 
tend to do is I put it on and then I
just<00:02:10.060> kind<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.330> try<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.539> keep<00:02:10.750> my<00:02:10.899> eyes<00:02:11.020> open

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
just kind of try to keep my eyes open

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.080 
just kind of try to keep my eyes open
for<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> minute<00:02:11.680> or<00:02:11.920> two<00:02:11.950> because<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.580> sets<00:02:12.940> very

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
for a minute or two because it sets very

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.520 
for a minute or two because it sets very
quickly<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:13.810> I'm<00:02:13.900> thinking<00:02:14.230> about<00:02:14.260> its

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
quickly now I'm thinking about its

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
quickly now I'm thinking about its
unblinking<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.520> try<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.000> keep<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.330> eyes

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
unblinking but I try to keep my eyes

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.710 
unblinking but I try to keep my eyes
open

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
open

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.150 
open
just<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.110> couple<00:02:17.260> seconds<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.040> it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
just for a couple seconds so that it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.480 
just for a couple seconds so that it
sets<00:02:18.460> in<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.720> liner<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.440> just<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
sets in but this liner is just one of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.980 
sets in but this liner is just one of
those<00:02:21.610> really<00:02:22.390> really<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.870> awesome

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
liners there is a sharpener down on this

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.780 
liners there is a sharpener down on this
edge<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.020> don't<00:02:26.470> use<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.770> because<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.700> what

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
edge and I don't use it because of what

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
really really precise line and it's just

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.990 
really really precise line and it's just
it's<00:02:40.300> such<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.750> great<00:02:41.500> great<00:02:42.040> great<00:02:42.460> eyeliner

about it they do have a huge selection

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.190 
about it they do have a huge selection
of<00:02:47.140> colors<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.150> they<00:02:49.300> have<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:50.020> think

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.610 
of colors I think that they have I think
it's<00:02:50.560> 16<00:02:51.130> colors<00:02:52.000> 16<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:52.600> 17<00:02:53.050> colors<00:02:53.380> something

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
it's 16 colors 16 or 17 colors something

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.270 
it's 16 colors 16 or 17 colors something
like<00:02:53.860> that

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
like that

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.720 
like that
they<00:02:54.880> are<00:02:55.030> gel<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> gel<00:02:56.380> product<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.490> keep

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
they are gel it is a gel product so keep

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.280 
they are gel it is a gel product so keep
that<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:57.910> mind<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.390> some<00:02:58.600> people<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:59.050> gel

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
that in mind to some people like gel

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.810 
that in mind to some people like gel
some<00:02:59.440> people<00:02:59.770> don't<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:03.220> tend<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.640> like

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
some people don't I don't tend to like

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.000 
some people don't I don't tend to like
gels<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.330> pot<00:03:04.600> but<00:03:04.959> I<00:03:05.020> really<00:03:05.500> like<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.709> like

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
gels in a pot but I really like it like

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.520 
gels in a pot but I really like it like
this<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:07.180> that's<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.630> lot<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.810> why<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:08.110> goes<00:03:08.320> on

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
this and that's a lot of why it goes on

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.220 
this and that's a lot of why it goes on
so<00:03:08.800> easily<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.310> smooth<00:03:09.790> like<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.930> brown

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
so easily and so smooth like the brown

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.940 
so easily and so smooth like the brown
color<00:03:11.530> was<00:03:11.680> called<00:03:11.920> brown<00:03:12.450> brown<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.620> feel

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
color was called brown brown out I feel

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.199 
color was called brown brown out I feel
like<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.580> one<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.760> think<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.120> just

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
like and this one I think it's just

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.440 
like and this one I think it's just
called<00:03:16.420> black<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.700> doesn't<00:03:18.910> actually<00:03:19.090> say<00:03:19.420> on

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
called black it doesn't actually say on

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.380 
called black it doesn't actually say on
it<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:20.050> interesting<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:21.970> easy<00:03:22.150> to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
it that's interesting well it's easy to

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.090 
it that's interesting well it's easy to
tell<00:03:22.570> because<00:03:22.750> this<00:03:23.080> part<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:23.620> always<00:03:23.830> has

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
tell because this part here always has

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.410 
tell because this part here always has

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.000 
the color that matches it so if you have
a<00:03:25.600> bunch<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.989> different<00:03:26.260> colors<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:26.709> easy
