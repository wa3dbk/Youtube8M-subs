00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
whatever that was I forgot it's been a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030 
whatever that was I forgot it's been a
while<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:31.020> yeah<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.590> might<00:01:31.920> do

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
while and so yeah I don't know might do

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.350 
while and so yeah I don't know might do
a<00:01:32.070> giveaway<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.240> gonna

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
a giveaway I don't know what I'm gonna

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
a giveaway I don't know what I'm gonna
do<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:33.780> extra<00:01:34.049> structure<00:01:34.560> decks

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
do with all these extra structure decks

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
do with all these extra structure decks
I<00:01:34.920> thought<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.130> doing<00:01:35.220> giveaways<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.030> then

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
I thought about doing giveaways but then

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.910 
I thought about doing giveaways but then
I'm<00:01:36.750> also<00:01:36.869> thinking<00:01:36.990> probably<00:01:37.740> how<00:01:37.799> many

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I'm also thinking probably how many

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
I'm also thinking probably how many
people<00:01:38.100> would<00:01:38.189> want<00:01:38.400> those<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.240> they're

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
people would want those because they're

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.710 
people would want those because they're
older<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.250> anyway<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
older I don't know anyway we have a

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.340 
older I don't know anyway we have a
normal<00:01:42.720> regular<00:01:42.899> helpers<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.950> our<00:01:45.350> caste

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
normal regular helpers out of our caste

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.600 
normal regular helpers out of our caste
I'll<00:01:46.439> probably<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.100> than<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.310> opening

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I'll probably do more than one opening

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.010 
I'll probably do more than one opening
