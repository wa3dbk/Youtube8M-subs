foot seven by the way my car height my
car<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.940> about<00:01:55.040> 55<00:01:56.040> inches<00:01:56.640> tall<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:59.060> these

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
car is about 55 inches tall so these

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.770 
car is about 55 inches tall so these
tasks<00:02:00.540> aren't<00:02:01.229> exactly<00:02:01.590> easy<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> 5-7

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.960 
tasks aren't exactly easy for a 5-7
individual<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.950> goes<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.370> show<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.610> how

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
individual and it goes to show you how

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.210

much<00:02:06.240> strength<00:02:07.080> training<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.650> does<00:02:07.950> help

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
much strength training really does help

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190
