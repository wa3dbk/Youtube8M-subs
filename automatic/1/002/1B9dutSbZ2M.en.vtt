00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so far I've really liked it I've had it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.160 
so far I've really liked it I've had it
for<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.679> two<00:00:14.370> months<00:00:14.700> now<00:00:14.759> I've<00:00:15.660> taken<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
for about two months now I've taken it

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.400 
for about two months now I've taken it
out<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.560> lot<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> runs<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> snow<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.410> in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
out on a lot of runs in the snow and in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.210 
out on a lot of runs in the snow and in
the<00:00:19.550> salt<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.880> slush<00:00:21.600> there's<00:00:22.080> about<00:00:22.260> 2<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:22.949> 3

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the salt and slush there's about 2 or 3

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
the salt and slush there's about 2 or 3
inches<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.580> slush<00:00:23.880> today<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:25.050> about<00:00:25.230> 30

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
inches of slush today it's about 30

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
inches of slush today it's about 30
degrees<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.310> melting<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:26.789> bit

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
degrees so it was melting a little bit

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.120 
degrees so it was melting a little bit
and<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.660> lot<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> puddles<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.420> my<00:00:30.420> feet<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.130> went

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and a lot of puddles and my feet I went

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.430 
and a lot of puddles and my feet I went
into<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> ton<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> puddles<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
into a ton of the puddles and it's you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.100 
into a ton of the puddles and it's you
know<00:00:34.500> they're<00:00:34.800> cold<00:00:35.160> wet<00:00:35.399> puddles<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.110> my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
know they're cold wet puddles and my

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.979 
know they're cold wet puddles and my
toes<00:00:37.320> didn't<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.710> wet<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.950> all<00:00:38.070> mom<00:00:38.989> there's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
toes didn't get wet at all mom there's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
toes didn't get wet at all mom there's
some<00:00:40.290> jagged<00:00:40.559> art<00:00:40.829> ice<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
some jagged art ice out there and this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720 
some jagged art ice out there and this
traction<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> bottom<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.129> protected

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
traction on the bottom really protected

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.229 
traction on the bottom really protected
against<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.520> it's<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> beefy

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
against any of that it's kind of a beefy

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.040 
against any of that it's kind of a beefy
or<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.570> than<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.170> Vakeel<00:00:49.620> ax<00:00:49.800> or<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:51.780> even

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
or so than the Vakeel ax or that even

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
or so than the Vakeel ax or that even
the<00:00:52.140> spider<00:00:52.440> Don<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> beefier

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the spider Don I think this is beefier

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
the spider Don I think this is beefier
than<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.570> first<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.620> Rock

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
than that and not first more Rock

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
than that and not first more Rock
protection<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.840> does<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.289> job

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
protection but it really does a good job

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.819 
protection but it really does a good job
of<00:00:58.760> keeping<00:00:59.760> out<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> snow<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> ice<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of keeping out the snow and ice and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
of keeping out the snow and ice and
water<00:01:02.160> especially<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.149> keeps<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.570> feet

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
water especially and keeps your feet

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.219 
water especially and keeps your feet
warm<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.140> dry<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.820> wore<00:01:05.820> him<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
warm and dry I wore him down to about I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.890 
warm and dry I wore him down to about I
think<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.040> 10<00:01:08.340> degrees<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.850> day<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.720> toes

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
think it was 10 degrees one day my toes

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.390 
think it was 10 degrees one day my toes
never<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.830> warmed<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> day<00:01:11.760> but

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
never really warmed up on that day but

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.880 
never really warmed up on that day but
but<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> mean<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> wasn't<00:01:15.750> too<00:01:15.869> bad<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
but what I mean it wasn't too bad and so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.030 
but what I mean it wasn't too bad and so
I<00:01:17.479> really<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.750> model<00:01:18.990> winter<00:01:19.710> runnings

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I really like this model winter runnings

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.609 
I really like this model winter runnings
been<00:01:20.220> tough<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> 5<00:01:21.900> fingers<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
been tough if you like the 5 fingers and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
been tough if you like the 5 fingers and
I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.820> model<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.479> does<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> great

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I think this model really does a great

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.950 
I think this model really does a great
job<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.920> neoprene<00:01:26.369> collar<00:01:26.759> goes<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.930> up

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
job the neoprene collar goes way up

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.219 
job the neoprene collar goes way up
towards<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.829> ankles<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:30.180> keeps<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.689> lot<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
towards your ankles so it keeps a lot of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.370 
towards your ankles so it keeps a lot of
snow<00:01:31.560> nice<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:33.450> does<00:01:33.659> exactly<00:01:33.930> what<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

some of the other models I just use a
velcro<00:01:45.210> strip<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.799> lot<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> times<00:01:47.250> it

velcro strip because a lot of times it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.399 
velcro strip because a lot of times it
pulls<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> heel<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.229> doesn't

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
pulls on the heel but this one doesn't

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
pulls on the heel but this one doesn't
pull<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> heel<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.820> goes<00:01:51.540> across<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

top<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.829> shoe<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.960> gets<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> pretty

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
top of the shoe and it gets a pretty

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.440 
snug fit across the mid foot and then
your<00:01:58.049> toes<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:59.100> allowed<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> display<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
your toes are allowed to display and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.480 
your toes are allowed to display and
there's<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.290> lot<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> bunching<00:02:02.369> or

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
there's not a lot of bunching or

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.359 
there's not a lot of bunching or
anything<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> think

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
anything here and I like that so I think

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
anything here and I like that so I think
if<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.090> looking<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> winter<00:02:06.689> running

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
if you're looking for a winter running

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
if you're looking for a winter running
shoe<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.580> you're<00:02:08.580> you're<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
shoe and you're you're not going to be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
shoe and you're you're not going to be
going<00:02:09.599> below<00:02:09.989> zero<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.500> anything<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
going below zero or anything like that I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
going below zero or anything like that I
think<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.670> will<00:02:11.819> really<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> trick

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
think this will really do the trick

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.479 
think this will really do the trick
especially<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.770> mean<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.129> you'd<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
especially I mean if you'd like the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.500 
especially I mean if you'd like the
v-rooms<00:02:16.550> it's<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.610> great<00:02:17.819> shoe<00:02:18.030> try<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.360> out

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
v-rooms it's a great shoe try it out

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
v-rooms it's a great shoe try it out
it's<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:19.170> expensive<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.980> can't<00:02:20.610> remember

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it's pretty expensive I can't remember

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's pretty expensive I can't remember
how<00:02:21.000> much<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.330> was<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.569> think<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.110> 150<00:02:22.620> but

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
how much it was I think was like 150 but

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.369 
how much it was I think was like 150 but
for<00:02:24.180> me<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.420> was<00:02:24.540> worth<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:26.480> yeah<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
for me it was worth it and yeah like it

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.880 
for me it was worth it and yeah like it
so<00:02:29.160> that's<00:02:29.489> my<00:02:29.610> review<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.410> vibra<00:02:31.410> mantra

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
