00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 42nd edition of the boat show of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 we are in the pavilion s 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 and we are the stand of umberto capelli that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 sells boats and rafts and this year in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 occasion of the point of this edition 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 presents a new fisherman with a double 315 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.539
 entering a market that is dominated 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.269
 by Americans, however, this is a boat 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 Italian what is the plus but the plus 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.940
 first of all it is for us in a 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 moment of crisis we wanted to do 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 something different then a challenge one 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 challenge the American giants with a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 quality product which we are capable of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.510
 to do us with features 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 which are different than the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 traditional American fisherman where the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.840
 fishing and fishing and everything else comes 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.340
 left in the background 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 in our case we thought that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.020
 we are the Mediterranean so we have one 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 hull is much better suited to our seas 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.309
 much more performing and on our seas 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350
 we have thought about consumption and therefore 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 we did it printed with some 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 advanced infusion technologies where 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 we have reduced weights 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 of the boat despite the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 resistance may remain 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.159
 something more than the boat 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.229
 printed in the traditional way and this 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.540
 allowed us with the same engines as 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.460
 being able to reduce the consumption of errors more 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 autonomy and this for a fisherman 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 surely it is something more we have 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 also seen inside the cabin before that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 very well finished and also designed for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.759
 the family also for women 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.790
 yes here is another important plus is that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 unused spaces for fishing 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.970
 which are a bit the central part of the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.909
 console in front of the console 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.490
 we have studied a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.399
 the good sized cabin of good 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530
 height where we first have the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.149
 possibility of having a separate bathroom e 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 the possibility of being able to sleep there too 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.909
 one night two people but in the part 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 external 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.159
 we have the opportunity to do 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 come our family too 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 wives when he said to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 fish because they have created a 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.410
 central sundeck with for two people 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 the two side benches made to chance 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.400
 long and the possibility of being able there 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.569
 are four people without interfering on 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.610
 what the fishing world 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.260
 ok what a great comeback this boat mounts 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.079
 outboards no 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.299
 objectively it is ideal for outboards 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.129
 fishing in this case to arrive 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.590
 quickly on the point of fishing at 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.829
 maximum motorization and two for 300 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.239
 horses and you surf at what speed you are 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.069
 then the maximum speed arrives 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.160
 that we can arrive with these 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.810
 boats are 45 knots and some notes 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.180
 more depending on sea conditions 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.910
 therefore to risi it arrives quickly on the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.560
 fishing spot and after that everything is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.299
 plays with the trainer we know very well 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 that engines the bitters right now 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.540
 to delays on the details which also a 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.389
 low origins have returns 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.799
 important thanks umberto see you for 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.450
 the next news that will be 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.530
 presented in days in the next 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.530
 days to you the line
