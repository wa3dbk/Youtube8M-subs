 opportunity I bring you a tutorial for 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.599
 solve the error or the problem of the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.960
 God's window ' in time draw or 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.000
 place 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.060
 a window that opens up to us is like a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.160
 sort of error that comes out when you do not 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.119
 execute a program well maybe the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.890
 program may have been more downloaded 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.340
 this we go to circumstances that 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 provoke him 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.380
 this error 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.940
 more than everything is an internet program 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.039
 explorer 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.219
 a problem in which internet explore 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.829
 sends you information about a script 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.050
 that is not working well this as 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.690
 can see in this week be there is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.489
 the error may have appeared 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.340
 before then we do not have it here in the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.240
 left side 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.280
 this all that is the window 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.650
 tells us to select from google 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.840
 there were many things so let's go and not 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.330
 teach me how to remove the error 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.780
 Well what they are going to do to us is to get 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.270
 on the internet explorer so be clear 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.950
 google chrome xy is always player must 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.560
 have explorer 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.899
 once they have opened it, they will 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.659
 search option tool in this 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.719
 part 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.240
 and look for the option that says options 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.290
 eternal and we click and should not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.260
 appear a window 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.750
 this sample we give you click here options 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.110
 advanced and we look for the shpe in the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.110
 eyelash 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.990
 the examine tab 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.420
 and what we are going to do is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.440
 these these two states should already 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.479
 be open this disabled when 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.549
 open this window what you are going to do is 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.130
 enable the 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.070
 after being advanced accept 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.690
 and that should be enough to remove 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.160
 the error and in addition it should never appear 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.160
 in that window of hosting time in this 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.010
 therefore the error is solved and 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.349
