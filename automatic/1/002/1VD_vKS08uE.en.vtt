00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.380 
really a timing push this is the one
base<00:01:34.920> Colossus<00:01:35.340> all-in<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.299> an

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
base Colossus all-in it's not really an

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.340 
base Colossus all-in it's not really an
all-in<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.229> even

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
all-in I don't know I don't even

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.719 
all-in I don't know I don't even
consider<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.829> all<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.490> really

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
consider at all and it's just a really

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.090 
consider at all and it's just a really
really<00:01:38.850> good<00:01:39.329> pressure<00:01:39.570> build<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.320> Norah's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
really good pressure build and Norah's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.469 
really good pressure build and Norah's
where<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> scouted<00:01:41.549> first<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.119> map<00:01:42.329> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
where I scouted first on this map I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.770 
where I scouted first on this map I
noticed<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.740> hub<00:01:43.979> down<00:01:44.220> positions

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
noticed not on the hub down positions

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.039 
noticed not on the hub down positions
like<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> spawned<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:47.360> down<00:01:51.049> there

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
like if you spawned up there down there

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
like if you spawned up there down there
really<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:52.590> close<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.549> with

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
really really close as you can see with

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
really really close as you can see with
my<00:01:53.700> probes<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> need<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.229> scout

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
my probes go and so you need to scout

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920 
my probes go and so you need to scout
the<00:01:55.710> closer<00:01:55.920> positions<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.750> your

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the closer positions to see if your

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.359 
the closer positions to see if your
opponent<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.619> especially<00:01:58.920> against

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
opponent is there especially against

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.499 
opponent is there especially against
Karen<00:01:59.610> if<00:01:59.700> you're<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> circular<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.299> need<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
Karen if you're a circular you need to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.910 
Karen if you're a circular you need to
do<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.689> against<00:02:00.869> Protoss<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.229> Karen<00:02:01.649> because

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
do it against Protoss and Karen because

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.429 
do it against Protoss and Karen because
you<00:02:02.549> need<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> essentially<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.290> your

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you need to essentially know if your

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.780 
you need to essentially know if your
opponents<00:02:04.770> close<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.610> your

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
opponents close to you because your

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
opponents close to you because your
build<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.509> depicted<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.170> hypothetically

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
build is depicted on that hypothetically

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.650 
build is depicted on that hypothetically
a<00:02:07.799> fee<00:02:08.009> spawn<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:09.539> have

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
a fee spawn down there then I would have

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.910 
a fee spawn down there then I would have
to<00:02:09.810> alter<00:02:09.989> my<00:02:10.020> build<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.470> Ike<00:02:10.530> wouldn't<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
to alter my build and Ike wouldn't be

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.210 
to alter my build and Ike wouldn't be
able<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.129> go<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.370> class<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> filled

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
able to go in this class is filled

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.500 
able to go in this class is filled
this<00:02:12.370> class<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.730> build<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.030> really<00:02:13.330> weak

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
this class is build is really weak

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.940 
this class is build is really weak
against<00:02:13.810> early<00:02:14.020> pressure<00:02:14.200> because<00:02:14.710> you<00:02:14.830> get

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
against early pressure because you get

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.200 
against early pressure because you get
your<00:02:15.040> second<00:02:15.280> gas<00:02:15.430> really<00:02:15.730> early<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.120> you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
your second gas really early and you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.500 
your second gas really early and you
have<00:02:16.300> little<00:02:16.570> units<00:02:16.900> early<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:18.510> just

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
have little units early on and so just

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.360 
have little units early on and so just
kind<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.900> lost<00:02:20.080> temple<00:02:20.320> spawning<00:02:20.650> close

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
kind of like lost temple spawning close

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.000 
kind of like lost temple spawning close
by<00:02:21.550> ground<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:22.210> really<00:02:22.960> really<00:02:23.200> bad<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:23.980> a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
by ground it's really really bad for a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.060 
by ground it's really really bad for a
jerk<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.460> Protoss<00:02:25.210> against<00:02:25.660> her<00:02:26.070> just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
jerk and Protoss against her just

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.440 
jerk and Protoss against her just
because<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:27.460> really<00:02:27.640> easy<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.850> rush<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.330> so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
because it's really easy to rush and so

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.630 
because it's really easy to rush and so
you<00:02:28.510> need<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:29.140> pick<00:02:29.290> your<00:02:29.350> build<00:02:29.620> accordingly

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
you need to pick your build accordingly

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.030 
you need to pick your build accordingly
and<00:02:30.820> likewise<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.110> position<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.890> need

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
and likewise in this position you need

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.410 
and likewise in this position you need
to<00:02:33.220> pick<00:02:33.610> your<00:02:33.760> both<00:02:33.910> accordingly<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:34.300> guess

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
to pick your both accordingly I guess

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.400 
to pick your both accordingly I guess
you<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.600> play<00:02:34.720> turn<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.050> don't<00:02:35.110> really<00:02:35.290> care

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
you can play turn you don't really care

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.670 
you can play turn you don't really care
about<00:02:35.710> where<00:02:36.010> your<00:02:36.190> point<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.550> because<00:02:37.680> your

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
about where your point is because your

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.180 
about where your point is because your
Opie<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:40.360> I'm<00:02:41.350> kidding<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.800> Opie<00:02:42.010> part

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
Opie but I'm kidding but the Opie part

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
Opie but I'm kidding but the Opie part
and<00:02:42.730> half<00:02:42.940> getting<00:02:43.150> what<00:02:43.360> they'll<00:02:43.480> be<00:02:43.510> fire

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
and half getting what they'll be fire

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.060 
and half getting what they'll be fire
but<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.110> know<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.560> doesn't<00:02:44.710> matter<00:02:44.950> where

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
but you know it doesn't matter where

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.620 
but you know it doesn't matter where
your<00:02:45.160> opponent<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.270> can<00:02:46.390> do<00:02:46.480> any

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
your opponent is because you can do any

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.560 
your opponent is because you can do any
build<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:48.040> turn<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.120> way<00:02:49.240> their<00:02:49.420> race

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
build like turn is the way their race

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.330 
build like turn is the way their race
works<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.170> don't<00:02:50.320> really<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.130> worry

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
works is you don't really have to worry

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.320 
works is you don't really have to worry
about<00:02:51.460> your<00:02:51.730> opponent<00:02:52.000> being<00:02:52.120> closed

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
about your opponent being closed

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.940 
about your opponent being closed
positions<00:02:52.780> as<00:02:52.960> you<00:02:53.110> do<00:02:53.230> with<00:02:53.380> certain<00:02:53.530> Protoss

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
positions as you do with certain Protoss

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.290 
positions as you do with certain Protoss
or<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.370> because<00:02:54.670> they're<00:02:54.790> definitely<00:02:54.940> built

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
or more because they're definitely built

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.320 
or more because they're definitely built
for<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> center<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> yeah<00:02:58.120> that's<00:02:58.210> how

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
for the center and so yeah that's how

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.730 
for the center and so yeah that's how
you<00:02:58.450> Scout<00:02:58.690> up<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.020> down<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.350> pretty<00:02:59.650> much

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
you Scout up and down and pretty much

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.710 
you Scout up and down and pretty much
close<00:02:59.980> positions<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.670> every<00:03:01.360> single<00:03:01.510> map

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
close positions and every single map

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.270 
close positions and every single map
that<00:03:01.930> there<00:03:02.140> ever<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.380> because<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.040> need<00:03:03.130> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
that there ever is because you need to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.880 
that there ever is because you need to
know<00:03:04.020> now<00:03:05.020> look<00:03:05.380> where<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.530> placed<00:03:05.770> my

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
know now look where I placed my

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.140 
know now look where I placed my
otherwise<00:03:06.100> completely<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.730> reasons<00:03:07.060> I'm

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
otherwise completely to reasons I'm

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.670 
otherwise completely to reasons I'm
placing<00:03:07.330> dear<00:03:07.600> one<00:03:07.810> because<00:03:08.170> his<00:03:08.320> base<00:03:08.530> is

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
placing dear one because his base is

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.110 
placing dear one because his base is
right<00:03:08.770> over<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.460> class<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:10.000> to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
right over there and so a class is to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
right over there and so a class is to
walk<00:03:10.300> over<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.630> ground<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.500> bus<00:03:11.680> will<00:03:11.980> get<00:03:12.100> to

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
walk over the ground the bus will get to

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.980 
walk over the ground the bus will get to
his<00:03:12.310> base<00:03:12.490> as<00:03:12.730> fast<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.150> possible<00:03:13.570> if<00:03:13.720> I've

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
his base as fast as possible if I've

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.510 
his base as fast as possible if I've
made<00:03:14.170> my<00:03:14.320> robot<00:03:14.560> facility<00:03:15.010> there<00:03:15.160> second

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
made my robot facility there second

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.250 
made my robot facility there second
reason<00:03:15.640> is<00:03:15.910> because<00:03:16.360> if<00:03:16.570> he<00:03:16.660> scans<00:03:16.930> most

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
reason is because if he scans most

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.080 
reason is because if he scans most
likely<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.620> won't<00:03:17.709> see<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> scan<00:03:18.310> he<00:03:18.940> won't

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
likely you won't see the scan he won't

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.380 
likely you won't see the scan he won't
see<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.390> classes<00:03:20.140> from<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.739> normal<00:03:21.610> scan<00:03:21.820> if<00:03:22.270> he

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
see the classes from a normal scan if he

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.820 
see the classes from a normal scan if he
scans<00:03:22.660> over<00:03:22.900> there<00:03:23.080> then<00:03:23.230> he<00:03:23.320> will<00:03:23.440> but<00:03:23.650> like

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
scans over there then he will but like

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.880 
scans over there then he will but like
we<00:03:23.950> usually<00:03:24.070> do<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:28.000> yeah<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:28.570> now<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:29.500> don't

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
we usually do so yeah and now I don't

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.410 
we usually do so yeah and now I don't
know<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.190> guys<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.550> videos<00:03:30.880> car<00:03:31.209> this

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.440 
games kind of lagging for me I don't
know<00:03:33.459> if<00:03:33.550> it's<00:03:33.670> gonna<00:03:33.760> be<00:03:33.850> like<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.150> YouTube<00:03:34.390> or

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.040 
crap whatever it's okay but yeah so yeah
constantly<00:03:43.630> pump<00:03:43.780> probes<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:45.630> yeah<00:03:46.630> constant

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
constantly pump probes and yeah constant

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.120 
constantly pump probes and yeah constant
pump<00:03:47.200> probes<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.680> wait<00:03:47.800> for<00:03:47.830> your<00:03:47.980> by

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
pump probes and just wait for your by

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.430 
pump probes and just wait for your by
facility<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.300> be<00:03:49.390> done<00:03:49.570> okay<00:03:49.959> your<00:03:50.200> wife's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
facility to be done okay your wife's

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.140 
facility to be done okay your wife's
support<00:03:50.800> Bay<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.160> then<00:03:51.370> add<00:03:51.519> two<00:03:51.730> gateways

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
support Bay and then add two gateways

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.030 
support Bay and then add two gateways
again<00:03:52.840> you're<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:52.989> one<00:03:53.260> gate<00:03:53.410> for<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> really

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
again you're on one gate for a really

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.350 
again you're on one gate for a really
long<00:03:54.160> time<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:54.580> this<00:03:54.760> build<00:03:54.970> again<00:03:55.209> it's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
long time so this build again it's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.330 
long time so this build again it's
really<00:03:55.750> weak<00:03:55.930> against<00:03:56.290> SUV<00:03:56.739> marine<00:03:57.070> all<00:03:57.220> the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
really weak against SUV marine all the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.610 
really weak against SUV marine all the
ins<00:03:57.489> against<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.090> spot<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.140> possible<00:03:59.500> to

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
ins against it spot it's possible to

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.410 
ins against it spot it's possible to
defend<00:03:59.890> the<00:03:59.950> two<00:04:00.070> racks<00:04:00.250> all<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> few<00:04:00.850> not

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
defend the two racks all in a few not

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.490 
defend the two racks all in a few not
two<00:04:01.570> wrecks<00:04:01.750> holding<00:04:02.019> just<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.200> two<00:04:02.320> racks

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
two wrecks holding just a two racks

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.670 
two wrecks holding just a two racks
build<00:04:02.769> if<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.070> just<00:04:04.410> essentially<00:04:05.410> all<00:04:05.620> you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
build if you just essentially all you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.990 
build if you just essentially all you
have<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.860> do<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.070> just<00:04:06.220> use<00:04:06.400> probes<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:06.850> have

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
have to do is just use probes you have

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.259 
have to do is just use probes you have
to<00:04:07.060> pull<00:04:07.209> up<00:04:07.269> rows<00:04:07.480> but<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.989> can<00:04:08.140> defend<00:04:08.440> it

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
to pull up rows but it you can defend it

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.690 
to pull up rows but it you can defend it
but<00:04:10.269> yeah<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:10.690> again<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.800> have<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:11.950> be<00:04:12.340> again

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
but yeah so again you have to be again

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.490 
but yeah so again you have to be again
so<00:04:12.850> I'm<00:04:13.209> telling<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:13.720> guys<00:04:13.870> this<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.320> fair

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
warning you guys can't tell me you lose

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.180 
warning you guys can't tell me you lose
because<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:16.269> is<00:04:16.540> you<00:04:17.470> get<00:04:17.709> Roland<00:04:18.010> early

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
because this is you get Roland early

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.370 
because this is you get Roland early
because<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.459> can<00:04:18.609> get<00:04:18.730> on<00:04:18.880> early<00:04:19.180> but<00:04:19.450> if<00:04:20.229> you

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
because you can get on early but if you

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.460 
because you can get on early but if you
don't<00:04:20.560> get<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.770> early

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
don't get it early

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.170 
don't get it early
you<00:04:21.500> know<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.650> can<00:04:21.860> go<00:04:22.520> for<00:04:22.700> their<00:04:22.820> game<00:04:23.030> and

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
you know you can go for their game and

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.090 
you know you can go for their game and
now<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.870> only<00:04:24.050> make<00:04:24.350> one<00:04:24.560> obviously<00:04:25.010> with

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
now you only make one obviously with

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.410 
now you only make one obviously with
this<00:04:25.220> build<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.580> then<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.790> pump<00:04:25.940> classes

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
this build and then you pump classes

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.140 
this build and then you pump classes
because<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.810> need<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.020> extra<00:04:27.170> gas<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:28.190> since

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
because you need the extra gas but since

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.110 
because you need the extra gas but since
I<00:04:29.270> saw<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.630> Marine<00:04:30.080> inside<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:31.100> bunker<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.970> know

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
I saw a Marine inside a bunker I know

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.730 
I saw a Marine inside a bunker I know
he's<00:04:32.540> mining<00:04:32.930> more<00:04:33.140> I'm<00:04:33.260> assuming<00:04:33.650> he's

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
he's mining more I'm assuming he's

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.820 
he's mining more I'm assuming he's
mining<00:04:34.040> gas<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:35.260> because<00:04:36.260> they<00:04:36.350> usually<00:04:36.500> mind

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
mining gas and because they usually mind

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.860 
mining gas and because they usually mind
gas<00:04:36.980> and<00:04:37.280> he<00:04:37.550> hasn't<00:04:37.670> got<00:04:37.970> any<00:04:38.000> gas<00:04:38.360> units<00:04:38.780> so

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
gas and he hasn't got any gas units so

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.690 
gas and he hasn't got any gas units so

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
baby all right so there's a star port

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.110 
baby all right so there's a star port
over<00:04:54.260> here<00:04:54.410> with<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.680> tech<00:04:55.520> lab<00:04:55.700> I<00:04:55.880> don't<00:04:56.060> know

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
over here with the tech lab I don't know

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.670 
over here with the tech lab I don't know
why<00:04:56.210> there's<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.450> 10-5<00:04:56.840> he's<00:04:57.050> going<00:04:57.290> for<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.500> blue

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
why there's a 10-5 he's going for a blue

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.340 
why there's a 10-5 he's going for a blue
flame<00:04:57.860> million<00:04:58.190> drop<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> know<00:05:00.140> he's

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
flame million drop but that I know he's

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.300 
flame million drop but that I know he's
going<00:05:00.500> for<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.680> little<00:05:00.770> bit<00:05:00.920> blue<00:05:01.130> flame

going for a little bit blue flame

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.650 
going for a little bit blue flame
million<00:05:01.610> drop<00:05:01.790> by<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:01.970> way<00:05:02.120> because<00:05:02.420> that's

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
million drop by the way because that's

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.380 
million drop by the way because that's
like<00:05:02.930> V<00:05:03.140> build<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.590> do<00:05:03.740> when<00:05:04.070> you're<00:05:04.220> doing

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
like V build to do when you're doing

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.000 
like V build to do when you're doing
three<00:05:05.390> he<00:05:06.170> could<00:05:06.290> be<00:05:06.380> going<00:05:06.500> for<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.740> reactor

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
three he could be going for a reactor

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.390 
three he could be going for a reactor
drop<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.580> guess<00:05:07.790> but<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:12.050> yeah<00:05:12.200> again<00:05:12.919> generally

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
drop I guess but so yeah again generally

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.790 
drop I guess but so yeah again generally
with<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:13.610> build<00:05:13.790> you<00:05:13.880> only<00:05:14.030> get<00:05:14.240> one<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:15.590> get

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
with this build you only get one you get

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.440 
with this build you only get one you get
one<00:05:16.400> stalker<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.000> red<00:05:17.150> cell<00:05:17.330> that's

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
one stalker and the red cell that's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.030 
one stalker and the red cell that's
because<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:17.840> don't<00:05:17.900> have<00:05:18.169> enough<00:05:18.350> gas<00:05:18.530> but

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
because you don't have enough gas but

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.880 
because you don't have enough gas but
since<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:20.000> see<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.480> I'm<00:05:20.720> he's<00:05:21.470> going<00:05:21.680> for<00:05:21.830> a

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
since I see that I'm he's going for a

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.940 
since I see that I'm he's going for a
Hellion<00:05:22.100> drop<00:05:22.310> I'm<00:05:22.460> gonna<00:05:22.640> cut<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.950> thermal

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
Hellion drop I'm gonna cut the thermal

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.080 
Hellion drop I'm gonna cut the thermal
Lance<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.340> they<00:05:25.430> cut<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.700> excess<00:05:25.880> copper

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
Lance and they cut the excess copper

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.340 
Lance and they cut the excess copper
cell<00:05:26.360> because<00:05:26.600> you<00:05:26.690> need<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.930> extra<00:05:27.080> stocker

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
cell because you need the extra stocker

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.740 
cell because you need the extra stocker
zone<00:05:27.620> against<00:05:27.919> hellions<00:05:28.220> obviously<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:29.570> again

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
zone against hellions obviously so again

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.790 
zone against hellions obviously so again
it's<00:05:29.900> all<00:05:29.990> reactionary<00:05:30.470> like<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:30.680> was

expecting to do a build where all I was
doing<00:05:33.200> was<00:05:33.230> glowing<00:05:33.560> gsella<00:05:33.919> Colossus<00:05:34.669> and

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
doing was glowing gsella Colossus and

you again the thing you want to do
against<00:07:07.240> a<00:07:07.450> battery<00:07:07.990> is<00:07:08.080> just<00:07:08.140> run<00:07:08.440> now<00:07:08.530> the

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
against a battery is just run now the

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.810 
against a battery is just run now the
approach<00:07:08.860> you<00:07:09.040> don't<00:07:09.190> whatever<00:07:09.400> want<00:07:09.730> to

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
approach you don't whatever want to

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.580 
approach you don't whatever want to
match<00:07:09.940> to<00:07:10.060> do<00:07:10.180> the<00:07:10.270> damage<00:07:10.480> like<00:07:11.170> it's<00:07:11.410> done

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
match to do the damage like it's done

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.620 
match to do the damage like it's done
it's<00:07:11.770> much<00:07:12.100> better<00:07:12.250> to<00:07:12.370> just<00:07:12.640> run<00:07:12.970> rather<00:07:13.390> than

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630 
it's much better to just run rather than

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.000 
it's much better to just run rather than
like<00:07:13.840> waiting<00:07:14.200> for<00:07:14.230> the<00:07:14.440> battery<00:07:14.800> to<00:07:14.830> like<00:07:17.010> a

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
like waiting for the battery to like a

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.770 
like waiting for the battery to like a
lot<00:07:18.520> better<00:07:18.700> like<00:07:18.880> that<00:07:19.060> now<00:07:19.360> again<00:07:19.660> just

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
lot better like that now again just

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.300 
lot better like that now again just
beaming<00:07:20.170> the<00:07:20.350> crap<00:07:20.620> out<00:07:20.800> of<00:07:20.830> them<00:07:21.040> because
