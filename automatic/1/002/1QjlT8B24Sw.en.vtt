00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello to everyone well found 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.360
 I'm anthony nothing and today I'll show you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 the manger of the jewel I have 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 bought a few weeks ago and I have to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 say that it works very very well 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:26.519
 this is here in the manger e 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 practically works in this way the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.090
 the first key to the left is the one 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.070
 Mr 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:41.489
 I can in fact see that it is turned on then 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 the one in the middle that flashes from one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 programming of a quantity of food 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.010
 every 24 hours 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 so if you press the button 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 central puts in programming instead 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.979
 the distribution of feed every 12 hours 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.890
 in fact you see that the last one turns 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 button is very interesting because not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.729
 I know if you see here there is an m that is a 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.590
 mean marwan then whenever 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.079
 you like this button turns 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.890
 immediately so whenever you want 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.750
 feed him without being there 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 wait all these hours has passed to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 press the last button and see 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:42.259
 that the feeder to follow the feed 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.259
 the feed is loaded from this side here 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 studying this cover you see me 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.579
 I put a magic in granules though 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.929
 you can put whatever you want 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.189
 then to increase or decrease the 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.369
 amount of feed you want 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:07.140
 feed your fish on this 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.200
 side there is a slice there is a 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.569
 species of door that according to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.519
 how much you open the data more or less 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:21.030
 eat ok 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:25.319
 then we switch off the door yes 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.549
 so rule with this lever that yes 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.810
 move back and forth 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:36.720
 and here is an indicator of how much you have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.799
 open then adjusting this lever 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 blue 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.269
 you can give the amount of feed to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.310
 your liking 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:51.630
 see the wise men who pass right by here 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.109
 then I have a river 180 of the young woman 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.109
 obviously 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.440
 enough to apply the manger 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.330
 remove the cover you find 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.630
 on the left side of your aquarium 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.680
 in fact he sees that it is indicated with col 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.070
 symbol of the manger remove it e 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.830
 go and apply the lid with 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.600
 that is the manger door 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.180
 included in the package so not 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.320
 you have to buy it separately it's already included is 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.860
 the only problem is that when I give from 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.890
 eat with the manger when it turns 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.320
 the dispenser can fall off 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.240
 bits of food with out but not 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.580
 they end up on the ground however generally 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.020
 they should all end up inside without 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.720
 finish out 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.820
 this is the only flaw of the different 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.130
 but the manger is really for the rest 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.620
 very but very good also because 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.600
 being branded it is custom made 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.420
 so avoid buying 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.160
 feeders that must then be applied to 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.750
 to the aquarium by opening the entire lid 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.580
 maybe putting strange positions 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.560
 so maybe not really congenial to the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.210
 your aquarium model instead 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.280
 buying a branded product this 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:14.060
 evening all the aquariums of giu 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:18.440
 but I say all but the live series 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.120
 and then for all of them it's okay and that 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.840
 to say 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.480
 the price is not cheap it costs around 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.720
 to 35 euros 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.340
 however, it is a branded product 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.150
 always the guaranteed jewel is one 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.910
 therefore, a very long time 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.280
 it is difficult to break this one here 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.740
 it was the manger of the down and vi 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.050
 thank you for viewing sign up in 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.050
