00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.620
 oh that's glorious sunshine belonging 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.030
 foliage yes we come jump into the water 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.320
 it is not far cry 3 that we are here 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.030
 maybe they spielmann it to the optics 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 it's just classic that again 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.449
 was reissued for the ps3 and that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.019
 original but there were already for pc before 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.880
 Many many years in ten years 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.650
 and yes he has actually already all 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 the elements that are so far cry 3 now 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.910
 as new players of the tc came know 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 So you could drive around with jeeps 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.340
 Concert since a dropout is very 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.579
 many liberties various weapons 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.320
 Do they even have the navi means that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.940
 binoculars with which you mark opponents 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 You can be a bit tactical 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.640
 plan everything and then there is even 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.640
 this sequence was because of the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.620
 air flies with the glider exactly so 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.590
 that has the original 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.510
 and that came to me from crytek at that time and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.110
 ubisoft then the series after that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.519
 you actually just copied I'd say 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.400
 So the only thing that did not exist then 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.040
 it but the hunt anyway controversial 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 yes it does not matter that it is not now 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.290
 not necessarily also this whole 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.509
 rpg elements of the final at the original 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 yes I have a straight up school 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.509
 very fast for console games like 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 find and we soon got through 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579
 this island has a lot of freedom 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 my movement so the levels are very 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.960
 very broad and you always have 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 in options like you want to go four 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.280
 So you can say I'm sneaking 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.280
 dear and I try it a bit 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.619
 to make tactical or do so full 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.470
 of course it does not work 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.970
 problem, of course , the opponents react 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.369
 also a bit on it so if you 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 Now you have to go through with a crash 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 to reckon with more resistance 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.219
 yes and the card is also a special 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 So they are sometimes really extreme 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.400
 Well 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.750
 almost a bit unfair 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.660
 even if you're in the bushes somewhere 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.410
 hoxton guesses as usual somewhere and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.250
 suddenly we are not 20 types ass 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.190
 so beautiful from today's point of view 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.020
 the story is not that nice either 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.840
 was totally stupid even then 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.750
 You play types in the Hawaiian shirt 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.750
 an island lands where mutants are and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.100
 a dr warrior there the future of 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.690
 humanity we might be able to plan 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.790
 one at this exit the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.980
 international shipping routes here 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.050
 Can I perform my work without 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.350
 to be disturbed by the outside world 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.360
 It will not be easy, but the future 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.090
 Mankind depends on the success of mine 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.110
 research I will succeed 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.160
 a clearer one like me 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.760
 still find the worst 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.610
 Combinations endures and villains 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.870
 god what but ask a little good at 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.910
 at leveldesign there they are 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.470
 then really big trouble giving it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.350
 even with the classic variant so that you 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.519
 old beautiful mixas from these open 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.430
 island worlds and the see in level 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.570
 just new from the classic edition 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.820
 of course now on console 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.080
 adapted is one has a weapon wheel 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.130
 and can only gun four 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.810
 at the same time yes okay 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.269
 to steer better up to half the gamepad 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.379
 which is not even that's just the optics 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.269
 meanwhile 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.310
 I played the pc version at that time 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.599
 we come now so the graphic so 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.300
 even the previously in this island area 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.400
 that was very sweet at the time 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.569
 already well that was one of buntesten 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.989
 players of all times 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.629
 just three against what is on it is 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.410
 the classic edition does not work 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.799
 really fluid should not really 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.120
 his 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.510
 yes, I think we also have one 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.709
 few small bugs and soundbox especially 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.780
 yes could be better 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.980
 and by the way, we even the whole 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.390
 Seeing time these are the two genes 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.970
 I'm not as sure as the mobile 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.650
 iron time the mutants that has to be yes and 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.310
 it should be that little horror aspect in the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.720
 his game 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.310
 It is already extreme today 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.590
 ridiculous and even then has me 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.790
 incredibly annoyed because you stop later 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.069
 no more against these smart people 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.720
 fight but brave these mutants 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.720
 and they are just real or ugly 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.820
 really bad maybe yes again 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.590
 as a small conclusion I sum up every one of it 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.000
 the pc would have played for example 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.220
 I do not recommend it anymore 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.169
 to play because the ps3 version is just 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.450
 just no real hd version or 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.460
 that's it 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.960
 straight up place and has some problems 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.180
 and the game is also today 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.800
 just not as good as back then 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.450
 i just know things have changed 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.110
 and meet the claims 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.740
 But if you still want to make up for it, yes 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.740
 take a look
