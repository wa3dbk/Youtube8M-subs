00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.950
 deep sand instead of green grass and a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.509
 ball to be played over the net 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029
 must be in the middle of it 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.560
 the neighborhood kickers sebastian bay and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.160
 jan-philipp kalla went to the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 Thursdays on unfamiliar terrain 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.619
 Nevertheless, the two hit while 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.359
 mixed double with the german 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.580
 master in beach volleyball markus 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.820
 bÃ¶ckermann and mischa urbatzka not 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.079
 bad that you just hold too diverse 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.320
 getting him changed that was alright 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.890
 very good in the sand of course no 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.870
 problem so fast to the thing the duo 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.910
 baccara represents fc st pauli 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 at the fvb world tour 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.899
 the prelude is the tournament in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.390
 Shanghai from 29 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 april our homework is done now 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.510
 It just belongs to us every one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 stop in the competition mode 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.320
 switch and quick stop living on 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.479
 a good competition will come that we 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 just really stop into what 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.130
 we have just learned that too 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 to compete and I believe 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.100
 then we have good possibilities 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 also continue to come forward again 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 at the last not very seriously meant 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 hamburg were but before 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.500
 all schachter and snail demanded 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.579
 And although the second half of the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.950
 partie was played with the feet 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.869
 that even that looks easy 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.610
 than it is a big one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.690
 Differences seen between the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.220
 same volleyball 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.659
 At the end of the entertaining session 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.670
 not only stood on both sides 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.229
 mutual respect but also 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.210
 the realization that in the near future 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.940
 probably no change of sports 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.290
 will thus make great respect 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.260
 what the boys deliver 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.130
 in the garden one speaks of one 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.560
 timezone in the other fly jetlag 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.330
 You must not have there and yes that is 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.690
 already is really good what the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.690
 make boys 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.479
