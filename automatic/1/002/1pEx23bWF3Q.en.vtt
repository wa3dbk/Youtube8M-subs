00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 if you get everyone I'm fangs 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.920
 states if this is true we 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.930
 we found a mont day you know that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.970
 every day a bon duo and before 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.460
 start telling you that you should record a peak 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.910
 very ethical point outside of the jet mc 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.980
 Laced dotcom and I know what 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.600
 will treat the video will be forged 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.880
 Witch current standard and forgiveness 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.769
 typical of 24 people in the sand and end 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 not a program of 100 people in the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.960
 sand ten minutes or houses and to search 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 to agree people is going to be very 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 great the program people a very program 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 epic and good when it will aggravate then 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.100
 Now look at the video are the 2 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.450
 afternoon Spain time surely 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.610
 recorded between 4 pm when 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 Spain and 6 o'clock in the afternoon now Spain 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 now accepting it is worth so in the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.760
 moment that we are 100 people in the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.309
 server and I record the video according 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.629
 I'll warn you on twitter that yes ten 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 minutes before I will notify on twitter 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.469
 saying I'm going to record and ready so 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.090
 saying this let's start with the engine 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.260
 and the truth is that it's interesting that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020
 single 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.390
 we have here 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.339
 and the model and the truth that adds something 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.500
 that can come very well to minecraft 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.900
 mainly because we are all 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.270
 novices nobody when they start to maika they 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.310
 knows the plans and this one is going to help us 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.710
 a lot with this one wants crafter otan 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.840
 singles is one of the rest a table 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.229
 extractive and a book that we are going to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.790
 get this craft table that asks 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.270
 establish character that does not have the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.140
 the rest 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.719
 and you when you open it here you have the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.549
 objects of agreement everything leaves in the red 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.280
 that well all you can create what 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.840
 nice is great but if I now 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.939
 I'm lame and I say hey, I'm going to catch 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.870
 the seen that I have it in the inventory 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.860
 for example 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.860
 I'm going to catch 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.330
 lama for example 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.700
 what else can we catch like this randomly 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.150
 Obviously I'm going to catch objects 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.900
 a little bit of this 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.970
 I'm going to take my car for example 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.060
 I do not take anything from here I'm lame 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.480
 some sticks an hour of blaze I pick up 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.560
 diamonds and I take iron for example 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.560
 and I 'm going to catch 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.390
 today we are going to give 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.870
 and it 's finally already entered here and you see 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.180
 that right here leaves objects in 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 work of objects in green what comes out 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.840
 in green are that with or without what 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.930
 I have here right now I am going to be able to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.260
 create it for example diamond 164 then 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.180
 well kraft no longer a few drops or you 've 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.770
 past vice would be created tomatically not 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.800
 I have that I was choosing according 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.030
 this is great, you see, I see what 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.319
 that comes out green is what you can 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.450
 pose with the materials that I have 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.880
 now and what I can not create is the in 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.890
 red if I come here is all I can 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.330
 do vale here is all I can 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.310
 do with what I have right now will 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.270
 slow if I do well 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.430
 despite this I can make an oven and 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.250
 others being stone and I want not to lose 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.460
 the time not 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.440
 I do this 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.440
 You have what you can do right now 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.879
 it's a block 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.189
 after doing a lot of things and 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.139
 here same here it leaves you in green what 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.209
 there is no what if not and this is already 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.790
 small of the mod that you have that is a 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.889
 ability to create things without 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.420
 have to draw it and also with what 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.950
 that you know how to invent and tell you what 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.659
 what you can do in what you did not consider 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.569
 which is a table and perfect creative and 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.769
 that could prevent us in the future 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.180
 a lot of things so that having the inter 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.769
 and say hey I can do as what has been 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.450
 I remember that the crafter I do not know what 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.249
 I do not know if he has kissed me at least 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.260
 it's happened you have to remember me from this 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:47.329
 character or inside but say there's like 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.379
 a character of I do not know what then 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.239
 we are to know by heart and 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.000
 you come here and you take it and ready I think 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.069
 is a very good mod worth and that is going to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.099
 help a lot from each one future would come 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.650
