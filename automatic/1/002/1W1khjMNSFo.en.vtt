00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello my love hoe better known as the 

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:08.880
 of mowing the environments 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 the one of the kitty the nice ones so here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.300
 where I make the tables this was coming 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 workshop is a garage with four lights 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 some packages since I got all the rains 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.650
 to sanding you hear the sound of the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.230
 medical control machine 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.380
 not true because I do not have it is simply 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.439
 a trip four lights a table ones 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.000
 easels and accept what you get 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.770
 happen 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.080
 by hand how is it but before teaching you 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.699
 the table then let's go to two thousand secrets 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 to make these tables as 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.699
 important is to have good tools 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.489
 then what source is totally 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.570
 flat a tool that spent a lot is 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:56.970
 the element leveler is like that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.970
 but care is everything every day 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
 then the length of the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.860
 table if you want a shorter table 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.900
 as we cut it is very easy there is a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.409
 tool that can not miss everything 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 remove that month can not all equal 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.540
 have one of these but it's very useful 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.350
 because I had the length that is around here 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.900
 the brands and you do 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.060
 and the most cutting 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.650
 is cheated with the perfect technique 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.520
 symmetric this tool that is 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.520
 basic 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.510
 this has the form of the song then 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.700
 dragging to create the shape and 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.040
 disease is also important that the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.860
 Fiber cut out completely straight 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.689
 without steps wirelessly with this one 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.150
 will be carrying you going here so 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.160
 Y 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.260
 with these theories tools you can already 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.450
 make a surfboard totally 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.630
 functional another tool that is of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.820
 fashion a lot is this that I do not exactly know 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.250
 what is it good for but how do all the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.820
 gods and he bought me I think he is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820
 to make circles 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.610
 and well surely some little thing more 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.450
 I forget but will not 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.450
 tell all the secrets 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.900
 Well, let's go with my last creation 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:40.860
 català reviews here is basically a 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.910
 double parallel edge diamond 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.760
 symmetric 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.140
 with reinforced multichannel edges 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.140
 I do not know if you see them well 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.440
 It has some channels and everyone here 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.830
 to two of each function 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 has channel here here is a channel there 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.860
 another here another central channel another in the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.260
 multiple medium insists plugs will be for 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.769
 deportations channels is construction 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.960
 it's ultra like the ps and with the box and 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.440
 tinted 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.840
 this English without soul although the reinforced 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.520
 like the fiber patch I do not know what the fuck 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.040
 It means all that but it's a hell of a lot 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.490
 in the letters with the pineapple sure is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.320
 good the tirade 10 of teachers logos 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.270
 corresponding 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.490
 this is very important then 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.490
 because it is made by hand 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.780
 but the last thing that is terrible but 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.420
 well I realized big opposite to the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.340
 novel look when you have a turn if 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.340
 you throw the foot back and you hit him at the time 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.849
 and this one 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.040
 operate 360 accessories that we also 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.989
 come out of pisté is clear and do not fear 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.440
 Like the front channels do not know 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.629
 if they serve well they make the debate 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.629
 the table just like these channels like you 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.540
 You will be allowed to travel on the wave and 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.269
 we never go the table of the future 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.110
 many people will ask for that 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.120
 put this nonsense because it has a 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.979
 very important utility trimmed 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.110
 Imagine you were going home all purple 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.240
 he dropped the keys running against the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.780
 table and suddenly you are 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.979
 the little note in the car darling remember 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.840
 catch the children 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.389
 pussy fucks you the session but at least 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.080
 I pick them up and I'm sure you do not know 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.270
 forget and these channels here because as 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.789
 they say the car is sincere do not go to 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.060
 to be and when doing the duck you go the 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.060
 hand 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.780
 pretty 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.450
 or 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.370
 català in the future 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.900
 what a cool 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.850
 as fashion 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.240
 see how you're going to freak out with this in the 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.240
 Beach 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:29.000
 maybe these tables is that although the 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.000
 Usefulness of surfing on the beach 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.520
 exercise like this 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.680
 well, nothing that is if you want to do it is a 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.820
 table you see how easy it is it does not 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.740
 lack to have 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.550
 imagine numerical control 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.100
 cutting-edge technology tools 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.070
 lit up with this shit of light 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.230
 you can do things like that but 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.920
 good 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.920
 let's see
