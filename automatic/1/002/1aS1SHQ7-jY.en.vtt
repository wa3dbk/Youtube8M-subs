00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.260 

laughs<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.180> got<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> little<00:04:06.659> bit

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.360 

alright<00:04:13.930> then<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.260> can<00:04:14.380> take<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.710> off<00:04:14.980> and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
alright then you can take this off and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.370 
alright then you can take this off and
you<00:04:15.790> have<00:04:15.880> something<00:04:16.270> that<00:04:16.300> looks<00:04:16.480> like

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.160 

really<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.590> little<00:04:20.950> bit<00:04:24.630> position<00:04:25.630> respiration

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
really a little bit position respiration

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.160 
really a little bit position respiration
we<00:04:26.260> could<00:04:26.530> always<00:04:26.650> fix<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.130> if<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.310> mess<00:04:27.490> up<00:04:31.170> so

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
we could always fix it if you mess up so

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.680 
we could always fix it if you mess up so
then<00:04:32.260> yes<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.530> think<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.740> looks<00:04:32.860> like<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
then yes I think it looks like this and

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.560 
then yes I think it looks like this and
that's<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.850> probably<00:04:36.850> one<00:04:36.970> of<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.150> most<00:04:37.300> basic

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
that's it probably one of the most basic

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.270 
that's it probably one of the most basic
easiest<00:04:38.200> pictures<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.710> could<00:04:38.830> do<00:04:39.010> if<00:04:39.130> you're

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
easiest pictures you could do if you're

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.490 
easiest pictures you could do if you're
a<00:04:39.310> beginner<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.830> looks<00:04:42.010> pretty<00:04:42.130> cool<00:04:43.500> so

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
a beginner and it looks pretty cool so

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.670

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
something just something with the tip

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.370
