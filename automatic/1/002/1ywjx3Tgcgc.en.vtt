00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
right away but you know marine Kings TG

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.340 
right away but you know marine Kings TG
timings<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.399> quite<00:01:53.909> well<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.299> him<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
timings not quite well for him there I

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.469 
timings not quite well for him there I
know<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> fun<00:01:56.070> game<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:57.299> haven't

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
know it was a fun game but we haven't

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
know it was a fun game but we haven't
seen<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.320> quite<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.950> often<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.490> yet

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
seen that so quite that often just yet

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
seen that so quite that often just yet
in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> heart<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> swarm<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.680> yet

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
in the in a heart of the swarm just yet

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
in the in a heart of the swarm just yet
so<00:02:01.860> maybe<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.790> map<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.119> happens<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.509> little

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so maybe on this map it happens a little

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
so maybe on this map it happens a little
bit<00:02:03.960> more<00:02:04.200> often<00:02:04.469> i<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.860> saw<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.310> picture

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
bit more often i actually saw a picture

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
bit more often i actually saw a picture
i<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.060> reddit<00:02:06.329> where<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.600> player<00:02:06.840> did

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
i think on reddit where one player did

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.630 
i think on reddit where one player did
it<00:02:07.320> i<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.619> can't<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.129> recall<00:02:08.280> which

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it i don't can't really recall which

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.639 
it i don't can't really recall which
game<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.119> no<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.569> over<00:02:09.840> incentives<00:02:10.440> does

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
game it was no here over incentives does

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.050 
game it was no here over incentives does
it

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
it

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.479 
it
so<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.380> question<00:02:12.500> always<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:12.890> do<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.310> keep

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
so the question always is do you keep

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.490 
so the question always is do you keep
the<00:02:13.670> probe<00:02:13.910> out<00:02:14.120> or<00:02:14.390> do<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.110> let<00:02:15.230> them<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
the probe out or do you let them in and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.260 
the probe out or do you let them in and
never<00:02:15.770> let<00:02:16.069> them<00:02:16.190> out<00:02:16.310> that's<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.970> one<00:02:17.060> that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
never let them out that's the one that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.750 
never let them out that's the one that
the<00:02:17.390> forklifts<00:02:17.870> chose<00:02:18.110> now<00:02:18.410> willingly<00:02:19.069> or<00:02:19.280> or

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
the forklifts chose now willingly or or

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.670 
the forklifts chose now willingly or or
unintentionally<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.900> sobriety<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.349> was

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
unintentionally the sobriety for was

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.410 
unintentionally the sobriety for was
lowered<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.430> does<00:02:22.580> seem<00:02:22.849> like<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.150> rather

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
lowered so it does seem like a rather

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.640 
lowered so it does seem like a rather
cold<00:02:24.319> invitation<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.310> stay<00:02:25.520> forever<00:02:25.790> in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
cold invitation to stay forever in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.920 
cold invitation to stay forever in
Apocalypse<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.860> space<00:02:28.069> gas<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:29.150> spotted<00:02:29.720> by

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
Apocalypse of space gas was spotted by

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.930 
Apocalypse of space gas was spotted by
Elfie<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.860> believe<00:02:31.130> only<00:02:31.280> two<00:02:31.430> SUVs

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
Elfie and I believe only two SUVs

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.530 
Elfie and I believe only two SUVs
remaining<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:33.790> now<00:02:34.790> he<00:02:34.849> stopped<00:02:35.180> completely

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
remaining so now he stopped completely

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.720 
remaining so now he stopped completely
just<00:02:36.080> got<00:02:36.230> enough<00:02:36.500> gas<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.980> make<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.160> reactor

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
just got enough gas to make a reactor

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.009 
just got enough gas to make a reactor
and<00:02:37.910> it's<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> make<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.390> command<00:02:38.900> center

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
and it's going to make a command center

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.970 
and it's going to make a command center
so<00:02:39.470> very<00:02:40.130> similar<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.569> barracks<00:02:42.110> no<00:02:42.680> gas

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so very similar to a one barracks no gas

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.759 
so very similar to a one barracks no gas
expansion<00:02:43.819> where<00:02:44.660> you're<00:02:45.080> basically<00:02:45.230> only

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
expansion where you're basically only

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.729 
expansion where you're basically only
mining<00:02:46.250> minerals<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.750> with<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.230> one<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.620> do

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
mining minerals and with that one you do

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.350 
mining minerals and with that one you do
it<00:02:48.830> from<00:02:49.010> one<00:02:49.160> barracks<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.640> then<00:02:49.760> three<00:02:50.060> now

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
it from one barracks and then three now

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.850 
it from one barracks and then three now
he<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:50.720> make<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.230> second<00:02:51.560> barracks

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
he can make just the second barracks

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.770 
he can make just the second barracks
because<00:02:52.010> he<00:02:52.100> has<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> reactor<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
because he has a reactor and it's the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.990 
because he has a reactor and it's the
mind<00:02:54.049> game<00:02:54.290> really<00:02:54.590> that's<00:02:54.980> that's<00:02:55.610> at<00:02:55.819> work

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
mind game really that's that's at work

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.180 
mind game really that's that's at work
here<00:02:56.209> because<00:02:56.510> how<00:02:57.200> much<00:02:57.380> gas<00:02:57.620> are<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.040> going

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
here because how much gas are you going

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.320 
here because how much gas are you going
to<00:02:58.250> be<00:02:58.280> mining<00:02:58.700> are<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.880> going<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> be<00:02:59.120> making

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
to be mining are you going to be making

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.890 
to be mining are you going to be making
a<00:02:59.569> factory<00:03:00.049> I've<00:03:00.739> got<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.099> find<00:03:01.280> out<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:01.970> watch

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
a factory I've got to find out so watch

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.600 
a factory I've got to find out so watch
for<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.260> mothership<00:03:03.709> core<00:03:03.890> may<00:03:04.099> be<00:03:04.160> trying<00:03:04.400> to

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
for the mothership core may be trying to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.789 
for the mothership core may be trying to
do<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> fly<00:03:05.060> into<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.599> Terran<00:03:05.900> base<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.440> if

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
do a fly into the Terran base and if

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.250 
do a fly into the Terran base and if
apocalypse<00:03:07.400> can<00:03:07.610> properly<00:03:08.150> zone<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.870> out<00:03:08.989> with

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
apocalypse can properly zone it out with

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.009 
apocalypse can properly zone it out with
his<00:03:09.410> Marines<00:03:09.830> he<00:03:10.489> can<00:03:10.760> maintain<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.780> illusion

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
his Marines he can maintain the illusion

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.140 
his Marines he can maintain the illusion
that<00:03:12.319> he's<00:03:12.680> making<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.130> factory<00:03:13.519> where<00:03:13.670> it's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
that he's making a factory where it's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.000 
that he's making a factory where it's
just<00:03:14.390> mining<00:03:14.750> minerals<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.470> getting<00:03:15.739> marines

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
just mining minerals and getting marines

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.160 
just mining minerals and getting marines
and<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.310> cities<00:03:16.609> I<00:03:16.940> feel<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.750> general<00:03:17.930> in

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
and I cities I feel just in general in

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.780 
and I cities I feel just in general in
the<00:03:18.230> last<00:03:18.440> few<00:03:18.650> games<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:19.160> we<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.519> once

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
the last few games that we have once

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.750 
the last few games that we have once
again<00:03:20.060> he'll<00:03:20.329> be<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:20.930> into<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.590> 4k<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.549> no

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
again he'll be going into that 4k and no

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.360 
again he'll be going into that 4k and no
second<00:03:23.150> base<00:03:23.239> yeah<00:03:23.739> okay<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:25.040> was<00:03:25.220> just

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
second base yeah okay but I was just

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.740 
second base yeah okay but I was just
about<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.609> say<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.030> one<00:03:26.359> thing<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.600> I

about to say like the one thing that I

style<00:03:36.530> he<00:03:36.799> was<00:03:36.920> always<00:03:37.160> put<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.579> position

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
style he was always put in a position

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.220 
style he was always put in a position
where<00:03:37.970> he<00:03:38.150> suddenly<00:03:38.390> had<00:03:38.569> to<00:03:38.660> defend<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.140> he

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
where he suddenly had to defend and he

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.259 
where he suddenly had to defend and he
had<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.500> adjust<00:03:39.769> what<00:03:40.040> Elfi<00:03:40.400> did<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.730> didn't
