in family getting hacked just random
need<00:04:15.010> point<00:04:15.280> sometimes<00:04:15.760> come<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.030> get<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:18.000> my

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
need point sometimes come to get and my

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.900 
need point sometimes come to get and my
advice<00:04:19.390> for<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:20.859> see<00:04:21.280> their<00:04:21.580> car

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
advice for that is if you see their car

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.710 
advice for that is if you see their car
like<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.540> know<00:04:22.720> if<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.440> know<00:04:23.590> it's<00:04:23.740> them<00:04:24.040> I

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
like if you know if you know it's them I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.300 
like if you know if you know it's them I
do<00:04:25.720> not<00:04:25.900> profile<00:04:26.440> them<00:04:27.390> just<00:04:28.390> kill<00:04:29.100> because<00:04:30.100> as

do not profile them just kill because as

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.090 
do not profile them just kill because as
soon<00:04:30.460> as<00:04:30.580> their<00:04:30.790> profile<00:04:31.270> later<00:04:31.780> they<00:04:32.740> do<00:04:32.800> this

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
soon as their profile later they do this

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.640 
soon as their profile later they do this
you<00:04:33.580> run<00:04:33.760> away<00:04:34.090> drive<00:04:34.840> away<00:04:34.990> as<00:04:35.320> good<00:04:35.560> as

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you run away drive away as good as

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.810 
you run away drive away as good as
possible<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.270> catching<00:04:37.270> them<00:04:37.919> is<00:04:38.919> near

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
possible and catching them is near

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.210 
possible and catching them is near
impossible<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:41.110> if<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.350> see<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> car<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.160> you
