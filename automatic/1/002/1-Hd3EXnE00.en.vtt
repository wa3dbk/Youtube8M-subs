00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.529
 manson is a dancer of whom you have been 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.640
 already spoken well he agreed to us 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.589
 deliver some of his little ones 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.610
 secrets 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.099
 remember last year at the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.929
 just standing he won in hans category 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.540
 with his crew wanted 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.010
 this is of course mam sol here's all 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.010
 immediately his portrait in ride in the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.230
 c 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.290
 I present my name is manson mamÃ©s 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.449
 manson So here I have top part 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.530
 have been possible on the spurs are the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.829
 dance groups here I am 34 years old and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.360
 specialties in the hood mc face so 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.769
 already on house music 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.140
 we will say it is rather aim high 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.220
 steppe level at the flea level 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.220
 aerial rebound 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.630
 then I had confidence in myself and then 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.830
 my style is evolved ie after 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.510
 had a lot of influence a little 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 everywhere not necessarily from the middle of the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.040
 dance but from what I can see from this 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.710
 that I can live and my style in Paris 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 compared to that it is often said that the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 dance is a reflection of the personality 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
 So here is what I see what 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.100
 I feel what I live if the music 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.479
 makes me want to be fidget fluids 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 have fun they make me want to be 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.750
 bag said I'll jerk you I 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.570
 really tried to adapt to the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 music after saying that my style is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.140
 fluid or more jerky I should not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 to say it because I will try 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.800
 to really adapt to music after 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.369
 I will talk about inspiration by way 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.160
 for matrix 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.940
 it's a movie here it has effects and 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.740
 in my in what I want 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.470
 to integrate these effects into one of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.039
 effects for the movements or 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.830
 statements 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.450
 they are not necessarily logical but who 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.160
 really gives an effect as much in terms 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.930
 dance after there are ya mangas 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720
 or you just know some postures of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.429
 attitudes to have 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.440
 I like dragon ball one piece 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.119
 here I like having postures 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.000
 attitudes 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.209
 here it's just two universes one 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.209
 incorporated into a time c is it gives 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.209
 institutions 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.549
 to fight for me this is the 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.140
 surpassing oneself shown in the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.650
 fight the work you could do to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.879
 training 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.709
 what to say we pass 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.940
 a lot of time in a room in 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.019
 a training room and that 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.299
 when we introduce ourselves and ben we show 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.530
 five ten minutes or an hour and 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.640
 when he was on stage he must 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.230
 really show the best of you 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.700
 not what you spend a lot of time 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.519
 at workout see times at 8 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.340
 hours a day I tell you tale but 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.420
 nan me in years what these deaths is 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.090
 a lot of work 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.040
 you prepare movements and 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.409
 improvisation 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.000
 after what works the most is the one 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.030
 trial the spontaneous side so 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.890
 after that it's nice to have movements 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.990
 to be able to moved well vexed a battle 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.400
 bat that says battle says battle which he 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.410
 must have the weapons to be able 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.670
 to be able to win like my palmares 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.940
 the peak of dante I started the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.100
 competition I won a lot 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.570
 fifty we'll say battles in 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.030
 all styles not just in the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.060
 house but in hip hop in a sense in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.060
 group break too 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.790
 it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.519
 choreographer and from a music 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.900
 here you listen to a front and beat done 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.790
 good are there makes me want to do 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.680
 this movement eto o o otherwise we try 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.200
 to be as musical as possible for 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.080
 for your choreography and are 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.239
 connected for me for me it's 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.799
 the inspiration is really 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.879
 the inspiration I will not do force I 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.959
 do not necessarily put packs 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.160
 hesitated there precisely the goal we did not have 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.329
 people saw my choreography there it's 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.070
 to see something new 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.930
 not something we've seen before and 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.449
 reviewed otherwise it is useless to be 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.449
 choreographer kind not interested 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:38.209
 future projects always shot with 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:40.939
 the companies I have two companies 

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:44.300
 syrian the stepper 014 also continue to 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.529
 give courses of costs be cros and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.550
 choreographer later great 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.550
 choreographers why not
