daran here and i want to show you this
this<00:00:10.570> was<00:00:10.750> my<00:00:10.900> first<00:00:12.119> professional<00:00:13.119> if<00:00:13.330> you

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
this was my first professional if you

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.150 
this was my first professional if you
want<00:00:13.629> to<00:00:13.719> call<00:00:13.869> that<00:00:14.049> a<00:00:14.110> prosumer<00:00:14.740> if<00:00:14.949> you<00:00:15.010> want

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
want to call that a prosumer if you want

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.880 
want to call that a prosumer if you want
to<00:00:15.250> call<00:00:15.369> it<00:00:15.459> that<00:00:15.510> shotgun<00:00:16.510> microphone<00:00:17.260> this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
to call it that shotgun microphone this

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.450 
to call it that shotgun microphone this
is<00:00:17.949> the<00:00:18.189> audio<00:00:18.640> technica<00:00:18.869> 88<00:00:19.869> 97<00:00:20.410> it<00:00:21.189> cost

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
is the audio technica 88 97 it cost

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.240 
is the audio technica 88 97 it cost
around<00:00:21.840> $250<00:00:22.840> and<00:00:23.110> it<00:00:23.560> is<00:00:23.650> I<00:00:23.770> guess<00:00:23.980> what<00:00:24.130> you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
around $250 and it is I guess what you

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.939 
around $250 and it is I guess what you
would<00:00:24.340> call<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.730> mid-range<00:00:25.560> microphone<00:00:26.560> it's<00:00:26.860> a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
would call a mid-range microphone it's a

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.560 
would call a mid-range microphone it's a
shotgun<00:00:27.190> microphone<00:00:27.730> so<00:00:27.910> obviously<00:00:28.240> it's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
shotgun microphone so obviously it's

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.560 
shotgun microphone so obviously it's
pickup<00:00:28.930> pattern<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.529> directional<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:30.850> has<00:00:31.539> a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
pickup pattern is directional and has a

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.150 
pickup pattern is directional and has a
pretty<00:00:31.900> good<00:00:32.050> rejection<00:00:32.469> of<00:00:32.739> other<00:00:34.020> axes<00:00:35.160> now

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
pretty good rejection of other axes now

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.340 
pretty good rejection of other axes now
I<00:00:36.430> bought<00:00:36.820> this<00:00:36.969> when<00:00:37.180> I<00:00:37.210> was<00:00:37.510> first<00:00:37.870> starting

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
I bought this when I was first starting

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.840 
I bought this when I was first starting
out<00:00:38.469> and<00:00:38.769> it<00:00:39.039> gave<00:00:39.159> me<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.309> lot<00:00:39.429> of<00:00:39.489> good<00:00:39.640> years

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
out and it gave me a lot of good years

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.489 
out and it gave me a lot of good years
of<00:00:39.999> use<00:00:40.149> it's<00:00:40.449> convenient<00:00:40.929> because<00:00:41.229> it<00:00:41.319> has

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
of use it's convenient because it has

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.189 
of use it's convenient because it has
the<00:00:41.800> battery<00:00:42.100> module<00:00:42.280> built<00:00:43.059> right<00:00:43.239> in<00:00:43.510> it's

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
the battery module built right in it's

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.489 
the battery module built right in it's
not<00:00:44.469> terribly<00:00:45.159> long<00:00:45.399> although<00:00:46.179> it<00:00:46.269> is

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
not terribly long although it is

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.290 
not terribly long although it is
significantly<00:00:47.499> longer<00:00:47.769> than<00:00:48.069> my<00:00:48.309> more

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
significantly longer than my more

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.189 
significantly longer than my more
expensive<00:00:49.929> 80<00:00:50.710> 40<00:00:51.339> 73<00:00:51.819> a<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:52.569> then<00:00:52.690> again<00:00:52.809> this

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
expensive 80 40 73 a but then again this

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
expensive 80 40 73 a but then again this
one<00:00:53.350> doesn't<00:00:53.530> have<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.710> battery<00:00:53.889> module<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.399> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
one doesn't have a battery module to it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.779 
one doesn't have a battery module to it
so<00:00:55.719> this<00:00:56.109> thing<00:00:56.379> I<00:00:56.649> mean<00:00:56.859> it<00:00:57.309> feels<00:00:57.489> like<00:00:57.670> a

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
so this thing I mean it feels like a

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.930 
so this thing I mean it feels like a
tank<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:59.049> has<00:00:59.260> taken<00:00:59.799> some<00:00:59.949> abuse<00:01:00.039> I<00:01:00.519> tried

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
tank and it has taken some abuse I tried

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.279 
tank and it has taken some abuse I tried
to<00:01:01.030> shoot<00:01:01.149> my<00:01:01.239> stuff<00:01:01.479> pretty<00:01:01.719> well<00:01:01.809> but<00:01:02.170> you

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
to shoot my stuff pretty well but you

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.629 
to shoot my stuff pretty well but you
know<00:01:02.379> sometimes<00:01:02.979> you<00:01:03.039> can't<00:01:03.249> avoid<00:01:03.429> it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
know sometimes you can't avoid it

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.690 
know sometimes you can't avoid it
getting<00:01:04.030> knocked<00:01:04.299> around<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.890> little<00:01:06.040> sheet

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
getting knocked around that little sheet

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.359 
getting knocked around that little sheet
on<00:01:06.850> there<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:07.390> it's<00:01:07.720> easier<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.369> some

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
on there is just so it's easier and some

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.430 
on there is just so it's easier and some
of<00:01:09.460> my<00:01:09.580> cameras<00:01:10.090> little<00:01:10.479> adapter<00:01:11.440> clamps<00:01:12.220> show

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
of my cameras little adapter clamps show

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.900 
of my cameras little adapter clamps show
their<00:01:14.440> little<00:01:14.740> shock<00:01:14.950> mounts<00:01:15.310> camera<00:01:15.700> shock

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
their little shock mounts camera shock

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.190 
their little shock mounts camera shock
mounts<00:01:16.180> always<00:01:16.390> for<00:01:16.570> some<00:01:16.720> reason<00:01:16.960> are<00:01:17.020> too

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
mounts always for some reason are too

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.320 
mounts always for some reason are too
big<00:01:17.530> for<00:01:17.560> these<00:01:17.950> skinny<00:01:18.250> microphones<00:01:18.790> but

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
big for these skinny microphones but

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.650 
big for these skinny microphones but
anyways<00:01:19.660> back<00:01:19.930> on<00:01:20.110> track<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:22.150> this<00:01:22.300> compares

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
anyways back on track what this compares

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.310 
anyways back on track what this compares
to<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:23.200> pretty<00:01:23.440> much<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.860> rode<00:01:24.870> ntg3<00:01:25.870> s

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
to is pretty much the the rode ntg3 s

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.230 
to is pretty much the the rode ntg3 s
this<00:01:27.160> is<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.400> line<00:01:27.550> with<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.790> pricing<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
this is in line with the pricing of the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is in line with the pricing of the
two<00:01:28.480> could<00:01:28.930> be<00:01:28.990> wrong<00:01:29.110> on<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.320> but<00:01:29.730> what<00:01:30.730> you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
two could be wrong on that but what you

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.490 
two could be wrong on that but what you
get<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.210> pretty<00:01:31.450> similar<00:01:31.690> performance<00:01:32.320> this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
get is pretty similar performance this

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.410 
get is pretty similar performance this
one<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.950> long<00:01:33.190> long<00:01:33.370> time<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.820> stink<00:01:34.060> fill<00:01:34.240> it

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
one for a long long time I stink fill it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.620 
one for a long long time I stink fill it
I<00:01:34.720> think<00:01:35.410> still<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:36.450> pretty<00:01:37.450> much<00:01:37.510> a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
I think still is is pretty much a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.420 
I think still is is pretty much a
benchmark<00:01:38.110> for<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.410> price<00:01:38.740> point<00:01:38.770> because

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
benchmark for that price point because

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.820 
benchmark for that price point because
it<00:01:39.700> has<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> great<00:01:40.600> great<00:01:40.960> performance<00:01:41.530> for<00:01:41.800> its

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
it has a great great performance for its

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.370 
it has a great great performance for its
price<00:01:42.490> if<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.240> are<00:01:43.420> looking<00:01:43.810> for<00:01:44.050> your<00:01:44.200> first

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
price if you are looking for your first

price if you are looking for your first
shotgun<00:01:44.830> microphone<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.580> you're<00:01:46.030> looking<00:01:46.330> in

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
shotgun microphone and you're looking in

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.150 
shotgun microphone and you're looking in
the<00:01:46.570> hundred<00:01:46.930> fifty<00:01:47.200> dollar<00:01:47.380> area<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.950> would

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
the hundred fifty dollar area I would

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.500 
the hundred fifty dollar area I would
definitely<00:01:48.580> recommend<00:01:48.670> trying<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.300> find

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
definitely recommend trying to find

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.690 
definitely recommend trying to find
maybe<00:01:49.659> one<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.870> these<00:01:49.990> used<00:01:50.470> if<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.340> do<00:01:51.490> side

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
maybe one of these used if you do side

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.220 
maybe one of these used if you do side
by<00:01:51.850> side<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.330> with<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.570> more<00:01:52.960> expensive

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
by side this with a more expensive

by side this with a more expensive
microphone<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:54.430> going<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.760> show<00:01:54.970> its

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
microphone it's going to show its

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.149

weaknesses<00:01:55.750> such<00:01:55.930> as<00:01:56.140> alongside<00:01:56.500> again
