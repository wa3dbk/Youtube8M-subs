00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
all right this is lesson three of death

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.910 
all right this is lesson three of death
don't<00:00:03.389> have<00:00:03.659> no<00:00:03.870> mercy<00:00:04.140> we're<00:00:04.500> breaking<00:00:04.830> it

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
don't have no mercy we're breaking it

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.099 
don't have no mercy we're breaking it
down<00:00:05.069> real<00:00:05.370> small<00:00:05.819> our<00:00:06.180> theory<00:00:06.600> being<00:00:06.839> you

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
down real small our theory being you

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.530 
down real small our theory being you
know<00:00:07.340> you<00:00:08.340> could<00:00:08.490> break<00:00:08.639> anything<00:00:09.000> down<00:00:09.120> small

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
know you could break anything down small

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.060 
know you could break anything down small
enough<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.960> learn<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.530> mean<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.889> all

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
enough you can learn it I mean it's all

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.850 
enough you can learn it I mean it's all
just<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:12.150> note<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.630> time<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.530> here's<00:00:13.679> what

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
just a one note at a time so here's what

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.060 
just a one note at a time so here's what
we've<00:00:13.980> done<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.429> far

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.220 

now<00:00:21.460> we're<00:00:21.580> going<00:00:21.670> to<00:00:21.730> go<00:00:21.850> to<00:00:21.910> B<00:00:22.180> minor<00:00:22.450> so<00:00:23.170> you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
now we're going to go to B minor so you

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.840 
now we're going to go to B minor so you
got<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.500> E<00:00:23.530> minor

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.820 

that<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.540> e-minor<00:00:27.990> move<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> a-minor

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
that was the e-minor move the a-minor

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
that was the e-minor move the a-minor
move<00:00:30.980> couldn't<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.070> easier<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> b-minor

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
move couldn't be easier now the b-minor

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780 
move couldn't be easier now the b-minor
move<00:00:33.840> you're<00:00:34.560> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> start<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.670> an

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
move you're going to start with an

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.319 
move you're going to start with an
upstroke<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.600> first<00:00:36.780> finger<00:00:37.080> here

of your right hand you're going to pluck
the<00:00:48.570> D<00:00:48.600> string

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.860 

and<00:00:53.490> your<00:00:53.640> thumb<00:00:53.880> is<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.150> come<00:00:54.360> down<00:00:54.600> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and your thumb is going to come down on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:05.980 
and your thumb is going to come down on
the<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.410> string<00:00:55.650> 2nd<00:00:56.430> fret

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.240 

and<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.409> open<00:01:06.710> B<00:01:06.890> string

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and I open B string

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.030 
and I open B string
open<00:01:09.180> D<00:01:09.360> open<00:01:09.630> G

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
open D open G

so<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> B<00:01:11.940> might<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.390> seven<00:01:12.840> move<00:01:13.050> is<00:01:13.320> your

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
so all the B might be seven move is your

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
so all the B might be seven move is your
first<00:01:14.370> finger<00:01:14.730> of<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.940> right<00:01:14.970> hand<00:01:15.120> is<00:01:15.390> going

don't<00:01:42.040> even<00:01:42.220> really<00:01:42.430> need<00:01:42.550> this<00:01:42.820> finger<00:01:43.180> but

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
don't even really need this finger but

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.870 
don't even really need this finger but
I'm<00:01:44.110> used<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.470> putting<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.860> b7<00:01:45.400> down<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.760> looks

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
I'm used to putting a b7 down that looks

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.730 
I'm used to putting a b7 down that looks
like<00:01:46.150> this<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.810> know<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.290> just<00:01:47.500> kind<00:01:47.710> of

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
like this so you know it just kind of

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.530 
like this so you know it just kind of
makes<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.070> think<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.520> b7<00:01:49.060> when<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.270> put<00:01:49.450> it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
makes you think of a b7 when you put it

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.030 
makes you think of a b7 when you put it
all<00:01:49.660> down<00:01:49.930> there<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.620> don't<00:01:50.800> think<00:01:50.950> you're

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
all down there you don't think you're

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.620 
all down there you don't think you're
really<00:01:51.220> going<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.400> use<00:01:51.610> all<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.000> notes<00:01:52.240> but

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
really going to use all the notes but

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
really going to use all the notes but
so<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.380> together

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so all together

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.330 
so all together
ah

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.630 

now<00:02:04.119> back<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.510> E<00:02:04.659> minor<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:06.280> your<00:02:06.400> first

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
now back to E minor with your first

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.100 
now back to E minor with your first
finger<00:02:06.940> you're<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.420> hit<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.659> D<00:02:07.869> string

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
finger you're going to hit the D string

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.949 
finger you're going to hit the D string
second<00:02:08.590> fret<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:10.509> you're<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> hit<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
second fret then you're going to hit the

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.740 
second fret then you're going to hit the
low<00:02:11.140> heat<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.950> high<00:02:12.790> E

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
low heat and high E

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.700 
low heat and high E
so<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> b7<00:02:16.470> move<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:17.780> second<00:02:18.780> fret<00:02:19.170> D<00:02:19.800> string

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
so the b7 move is second fret D string

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.470 
so the b7 move is second fret D string
second<00:02:22.640> fret<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.150> string<00:02:23.180> open<00:02:23.930> B<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:26.120> D<00:02:26.330> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
second fret a string open B the D and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.839 
second fret a string open B the D and
the<00:02:26.570> G<00:02:26.600> together

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.709 

and<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.239> he<00:02:31.420> minor<00:02:31.689> move<00:02:32.049> is<00:02:32.499> second<00:02:33.340> fret<00:02:33.719> D

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
and the he minor move is second fret D

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.030 
and the he minor move is second fret D
string<00:02:34.749> hit<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.379> with<00:02:35.469> your<00:02:35.499> first<00:02:35.769> finger

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
string hit it with your first finger

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.009 
string hit it with your first finger
down<00:02:36.310> your<00:02:36.430> thumb<00:02:36.730> though<00:02:39.719> they<00:02:40.719> do<00:02:40.780> that

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
down your thumb though they do that

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.320 
down your thumb though they do that
right
