have<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.580> confirm<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:59.120> but<00:00:59.650> so<00:01:01.210> they<00:01:02.210> didn't

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
have to confirm that but so they didn't

all<00:02:10.039> about<00:02:10.190> torque<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.700> diesel<00:02:11.030> engine<00:02:11.120> so

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
all about torque and a diesel engine so

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.600 
all about torque and a diesel engine so
you<00:02:11.510> get<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.840> enjoyment<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:13.130> they've<00:02:13.340> dealt

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
you get that enjoyment but they've dealt

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.550 
you get that enjoyment but they've dealt
with<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> NVH<00:02:14.360> issues<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:14.990> really<00:02:15.290> quiet

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
with the NVH issues it's really quiet

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.839 
with the NVH issues it's really quiet
and<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.850> towing<00:02:17.510> capability<00:02:18.019> is<00:02:18.110> wonderful

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
and the towing capability is wonderful

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.580 
and the towing capability is wonderful
so<00:02:19.849> anyway<00:02:20.239> hats<00:02:20.599> off<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.049> you<00:02:21.440> know<00:02:21.530> to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
so anyway hats off to you know to

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.580 
so anyway hats off to you know to
Chrysler<00:02:22.010> there

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.520 

being<00:02:27.590> able<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:28.269> have<00:02:29.269> them<00:02:29.540> 707<00:02:30.499> horsepower

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
being able to have them 707 horsepower

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.309 
being able to have them 707 horsepower
engine<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.609> a<00:02:32.030> car<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.269> starts<00:02:32.870> at<00:02:32.989> sixty

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
engine in a car that starts at sixty

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.800 
engine in a car that starts at sixty
thousand<00:02:33.739> dollars<00:02:34.040> that's<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:35.060> that's<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.629> big

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
thousand dollars that's a that's a big

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.379 
thousand dollars that's a that's a big
achievement<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.469> itself<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.969> this<00:02:38.090> is

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
achievement in itself so just this is

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.330 
achievement in itself so just this is
sheer<00:02:38.659> output<00:02:39.109> but<00:02:39.469> then<00:02:39.590> also<00:02:39.859> all<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
sheer output but then also all the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.129 
sheer output but then also all the
engineering<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.299> we<00:02:41.450> know<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:41.810> went<00:02:41.989> into

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
engineering that we know that went into

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.979 
engineering that we know that went into
it<00:02:42.439> with<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.680> crushed<00:02:43.519> diamond<00:02:44.030> washers<00:02:44.659> and

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
it with the crushed diamond washers and

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.399 
it with the crushed diamond washers and
and<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.409> all<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.590> all<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.629> extra<00:02:47.629> extra

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
and and all that all the extra extra

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.929 
and and all that all the extra extra
things<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.799> went<00:02:48.980> into<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.579> was<00:02:49.730> all

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
things that went into it that was all

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.449 
things that went into it that was all
very<00:02:50.180> impressive<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:51.319> no<00:02:51.620> there's<00:02:51.980> lots<00:02:52.310> of

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
very impressive but no there's lots of

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.399 
very impressive but no there's lots of
competition<00:02:53.120> there's<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.359> lot<00:02:53.659> of<00:02:53.689> great<00:02:54.049> v8's

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
competition there's a lot of great v8's

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.250 
competition there's a lot of great v8's
out<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:55.840> absolutely<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.109> first

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
out there absolutely the first

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.369 
out there absolutely the first
impression<00:02:57.859> was<00:02:57.980> how<00:02:58.159> quiet<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.989> just

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
impression was how quiet it is it's just

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.190 
impression was how quiet it is it's just
we<00:03:00.950> test<00:03:01.189> an<00:03:01.310> awful<00:03:01.669> lot<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.819> diesels<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.419> it's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
we test an awful lot of diesels and it's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500 
we test an awful lot of diesels and it's
as<00:03:03.500> quiet<00:03:03.739> as<00:03:04.159> as<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.730> diesels<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.239> in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
as quiet as as the diesels that in

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.259 
as quiet as as the diesels that in
really<00:03:06.439> the<00:03:06.769> luxury<00:03:06.980> cars<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.639> we<00:03:07.760> don't<00:03:08.090> we

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
really the luxury cars that we don't we

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.479 
really the luxury cars that we don't we
test<00:03:08.510> it's<00:03:09.139> also<00:03:09.379> of<00:03:09.590> course<00:03:09.799> got<00:03:10.099> a<00:03:10.129> ton<00:03:10.459> of

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
test it's also of course got a ton of

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.909 
test it's also of course got a ton of
torque<00:03:10.939> which<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.719> obviously<00:03:12.379> what<00:03:12.469> you<00:03:12.680> want

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
torque which is obviously what you want

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.429 
torque which is obviously what you want
on<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.099> pickup<00:03:13.340> truck<00:03:13.689> and<00:03:14.689> then<00:03:14.900> its<00:03:15.079> overall

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
on a pickup truck and then its overall

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.110 
on a pickup truck and then its overall
fuel<00:03:15.799> economy<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.629> refine<00:03:17.629> me<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.290> just<00:03:18.560> uh

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
fuel economy and refine me it's just uh

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.509 
fuel economy and refine me it's just uh
really<00:03:20.120> stood<00:03:20.329> head<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.599> shoulders<00:03:20.750> above

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
really stood head and shoulders above

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.479 
really stood head and shoulders above
just<00:03:22.519> about<00:03:22.730> well<00:03:23.510> really<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.709> other

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
just about well really the other

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.369 
just about well really the other
Diesel's<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.150> were<00:03:26.359> comparing<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.349> with

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
Diesel's that we were comparing it with

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.899 
Diesel's that we were comparing it with
it<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:27.859> its<00:03:28.010> segment<00:03:28.189> and<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.379> end<00:03:30.650> then

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
it in its segment and it's the end then

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.640 
it in its segment and it's the end then
the<00:03:31.909> fuel<00:03:32.209> economy<00:03:32.659> at<00:03:32.840> long<00:03:33.349> range

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
the fuel economy at long range

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.939 
the fuel economy at long range
class-leading<00:03:34.269> range<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:36.019> all<00:03:36.229> added<00:03:36.680> up<00:03:36.739> to

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
class-leading range that all added up to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.780 
class-leading range that all added up to
a<00:03:36.979> really<00:03:37.489> attend<00:03:38.150> best<00:03:38.389> engine
