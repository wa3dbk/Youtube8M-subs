this<00:02:59.530> program<00:02:59.740> is<00:02:59.920> we're<00:03:00.220> not<00:03:00.340> trying<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.700> make

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
this program is we're not trying to make

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.240 
this program is we're not trying to make
you<00:03:00.850> one<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:01.510> size<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.290> know<00:03:02.410> one<00:03:02.830> size<00:03:03.040> does

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
you one one size you know one size does

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.190 
you one one size you know one size does
not<00:03:03.280> fit<00:03:03.459> all<00:03:03.700> you'll<00:03:04.450> find<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.750> some<00:03:04.959> people

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
not fit all you'll find that some people

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.330 
not fit all you'll find that some people
when<00:03:05.290> they<00:03:05.410> start<00:03:05.680> following<00:03:06.070> these

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
when they start following these

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.010 
when they start following these
principles<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.390> know<00:03:07.480> get<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> little<00:03:07.870> bigger

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
principles you know get a little bigger

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.390 
principles you know get a little bigger
they<00:03:08.260> get<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.380> little<00:03:08.530> stronger<00:03:08.740> some<00:03:09.040> kids<00:03:09.280> get

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
they get a little stronger some kids get

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.500 
they get a little stronger some kids get
a<00:03:09.430> little<00:03:09.640> skinnier<00:03:10.030> some<00:03:10.209> people<00:03:10.390> lose

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
a little skinnier some people lose

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.970 
a little skinnier some people lose
weight<00:03:10.540> some<00:03:10.870> people<00:03:11.050> gain<00:03:11.200> weight<00:03:11.230> yeah<00:03:11.950> I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
weight some people gain weight yeah I

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.020 
weight some people gain weight yeah I
mean<00:03:12.100> really<00:03:12.250> it's<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:12.520> ultimately<00:03:12.880> coming

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
mean really it's just ultimately coming

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.580 
mean really it's just ultimately coming
down<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.360> really<00:03:13.600> wet<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.900> know<00:03:13.930> you're<00:03:14.230> yours

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
down to really wet you know you're yours
