00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.110
 hello girls and guys what I hope 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.300
 be very well thank you for being here 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.420
 with me today I bring you this video of my 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.760
 nail routine as I take care of my nails and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.470
 how to have a nails look like 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.130
 health in lamps and that we're going to 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.550
 begin the first thing I do is 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.560
 take my previous nail polish me 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.279
 usually last a week so each 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.850
 Sunday 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.850
 I do this this way is super comfortable 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.690
 simply insert your finger and in about 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 seconds comes no clean and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 we do it like this 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.560
 [Music] 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.410
 with this track I like to push the 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.110
 cuticle upwards and a little bit by the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.290
 laterals that makes the cuticles and 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.980
 vicuÃ±as look healthier and more 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.980
 delicate 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.930
 ah 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.090
 if you do not have this you can also do it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.670
 with his own nail the truth that I think that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.850
 It is the easiest and most comfortable to me 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.250
 I love doing it this way too 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 [Music] 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.030
 this part is super important to me 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.000
 like to cheer up the nails a bit for the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.250
 side and make them a little square 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 since vicuna are oval 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 the truth that I recommend that you 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.910
 file the nails as they prevent you from 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.130
 come out as layers on the nails and from 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.130
 I feel that the limo is not me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 break so easily loose is one step 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.900
 super important for your nails 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.670
 also beautiful and we get the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:02:00.360
 annoying layers 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:01.649
 [Music] 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.840
 these are the products that I'm going to 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.750
 use to paint my nails here not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.149
 I show you the quick drying drops 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.250
 here I have a hardening base that in 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.440
 I will not use this case because 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.330
 I have quite strong nails but in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 serious girls I recommend you use 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.120
 a base so we went directly to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.800
 paint the nails I chose this color 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.190
 rosita stick 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:36.010
 and well I give myself two layers 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:36.010

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.670
 to 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.670
 after he finished painting my nails 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.850
 He used these quick-drying drops of 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.520
 This is pretty good and it dries me 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.010
 nails faster than normal I've done 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.800
 two droplets on each nail that wedges 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.150
 more short cuts after throwing once 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.150

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.829

 girls 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.270

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.230
 they have a gel effect on the nails 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.770
 It gives a pretty nice and lasting shine and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.920
 It makes nails last me a few weeks 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.740
 almost perfect, not to say perfect and 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.230
 I made a pretty thick cap and 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.959
 with that it is enough to have some nails 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.240
