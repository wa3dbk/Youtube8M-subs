00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
so in this head-to-head we'll be

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.429 
so in this head-to-head we'll be
comparing<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.539> soldano<00:00:22.199> SLO<00:00:23.269> 100<00:00:24.269> amp<00:00:24.509> along

amp speaker breakup is completely off

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.530 
amp speaker breakup is completely off
we'll<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.699> going<00:00:44.940> through<00:00:45.089> all<00:00:45.239> three

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
we'll be going through all three

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.319 
we'll be going through all three
channels<00:00:45.829> when<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.949> sample<00:00:47.159> starts<00:00:47.640> off<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
channels when the sample starts off it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.280 
channels when the sample starts off it
will<00:00:48.629> start<00:00:48.899> off<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> crunch<00:00:51.080> that<00:00:52.080> from

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
will start off and crunch that from

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.450 
will start off and crunch that from
there<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:53.009> goes<00:00:53.580> to<00:00:53.640> drive<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.860> we<00:00:55.860> end<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.280> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
there it goes to drive and we end up on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.840 
there it goes to drive and we end up on
clean<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.299> that<00:00:58.129> holds<00:00:59.129> true<00:00:59.339> for<00:00:59.369> both<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
clean and that holds true for both the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.210 
clean and that holds true for both the
eleven<00:01:00.180> rack<00:01:00.299> samples<00:01:00.869> and<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> 11<00:01:01.860> art<00:01:02.009> at

eleven rack samples and the 11 art at

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.609 
eleven rack samples and the 11 art at
samples<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.540> also<00:01:03.689> be<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.989> drum<00:01:04.350> track

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
samples there will also be a drum track

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
samples there will also be a drum track
playing<00:01:05.240> from<00:01:06.240> digi<00:01:06.630> designs<00:01:06.990> strike<00:01:08.270> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
playing from digi designs strike the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
playing from digi designs strike the
drum<00:01:09.509> track<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.619> riffs

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
drum track is in there because the riffs

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.249 
drum track is in there because the riffs
I'm<00:01:11.040> playing<00:01:11.310> don't<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.909> make<00:01:12.090> sense<00:01:12.479> when

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
I'm playing don't really make sense when

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.200 
I'm playing don't really make sense when
they're<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.530> standing<00:01:13.829> on<00:01:14.070> their<00:01:14.250> own<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
they're just standing on their own so to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
they're just standing on their own so to
tie<00:01:15.479> everything<00:01:15.659> together<00:01:16.079> we<00:01:17.040> added<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
tie everything together we added the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.819 
tie everything together we added the
drum<00:01:17.670> track<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.409> like<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.500> said<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
drum track and like I said at the

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.280 
drum track and like I said at the
beginning<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.340> start<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.970> crunch<00:01:21.290> from

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
beginning we start out in crunch from

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.940 
beginning we start out in crunch from
there<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.940> drive<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.470> then<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.680> clean

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
there we go to drive and then to clean

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.890 
there we go to drive and then to clean
and<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.540> switching<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.020> done<00:01:28.260> in<00:01:28.470> real<00:01:28.740> time

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
and the switching is done in real time

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.510 
and the switching is done in real time
so<00:01:30.900> everything's<00:01:31.350> set<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.680> exactly<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.190> same

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
so everything's set up exactly the same

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.230 
so everything's set up exactly the same
so<00:01:33.390> let's<00:01:33.600> start<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> head-to-head<00:01:35.240> these

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so let's start the head-to-head these

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.000 
so let's start the head-to-head these
clips<00:01:36.540> were<00:01:36.600> recorded<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.560> 24-bit<00:01:38.549> 96<00:01:39.240> k<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010
