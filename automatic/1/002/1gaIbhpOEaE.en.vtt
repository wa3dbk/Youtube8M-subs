00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
looked really really good right now all

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.380 
looked really really good right now all
my<00:00:39.420> videos<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:39.989> being<00:00:40.110> shot<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.980> SLR<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
my videos are being shot on a SLR it's a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.610 
my videos are being shot on a SLR it's a
Canon<00:00:42.870> Rebel<00:00:43.079> T<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.010> eye<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.620> not

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
Canon Rebel T one eye and it's it's not

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
Canon Rebel T one eye and it's it's not
the<00:00:46.829> best<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.399> videos<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> decided<00:00:48.660> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the best for videos so I decided that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.709 
the best for videos so I decided that
I'd<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.890> pick<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.600> was

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I'd go and pick this up you know it was

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.799 
I'd go and pick this up you know it was
a<00:00:51.750> boxing<00:00:52.199> day<00:00:52.260> boxing<00:00:53.070> day<00:00:53.190> sale<00:00:53.219> price<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
a boxing day boxing day sale price so it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
a boxing day boxing day sale price so it
was<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> decent<00:00:55.350> price<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.570> hopefully<00:00:57.570> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
was the decent price and hopefully this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
was the decent price and hopefully this
will<00:00:58.280> be<00:00:59.280> able<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> produce<00:00:59.699> some<00:01:00.000> better

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
will be able to produce some better

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.200 
will be able to produce some better
videos<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.410> future<00:01:01.760> I'm<00:01:02.760> also<00:01:02.940> planning

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
videos in the future I'm also planning

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
videos in the future I'm also planning
to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.260> things<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.979> camera

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to do some other things with this camera

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
to do some other things with this camera
so<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.299> gonna<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.540> easier<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.260> use<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.710> as

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
so it's gonna be easier to use this as

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
so it's gonna be easier to use this as
opposed<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> SLR<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
opposed to the SLR but this is going to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.990 
opposed to the SLR but this is going to
be<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> unboxing<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> show

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
software that is not gonna do me any

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.069 
software that is not gonna do me any
good<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:49.200> iMac<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:49.740> no<00:01:50.009> CD<00:01:50.310> drive<00:01:50.520> so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I probably won't even install that we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.969 
I probably won't even install that we
have<00:01:55.790> instruction<00:01:56.790> manuals<00:01:57.240> manual

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
have instruction manuals manual

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.280 

this<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.340> flash<00:02:09.910> memory<00:02:12.030> HD<00:02:13.030> camcorder<00:02:13.690> so

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
this is a flash memory HD camcorder so

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.670 
this is a flash memory HD camcorder so
this<00:02:14.620> uses<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.459> compact<00:02:16.450> flash<00:02:16.630> memory<00:02:17.380> cards

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this uses a compact flash memory cards

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.910 
this uses a compact flash memory cards
got<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.640> couple<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.030> those<00:02:19.239> from<00:02:19.510> my<00:02:19.920> digital

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
peel and stick off onto the unit but

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.690 
peel and stick off onto the unit but
I'll<00:02:30.430> take<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.640> look<00:02:30.700> at<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.000> later<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:33.459> then

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
I'll take a look at that later and then

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.600

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.020 

we<00:03:29.500> have<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:31.170> believe<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.100> battery

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.690 

battery<00:03:37.030> there<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.859> small<00:03:39.220> little<00:03:39.370> thing

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
battery there it's a small little thing

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.819 
battery there it's a small little thing
but<00:03:40.000> two<00:03:40.269> fingers<00:03:40.569> width<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.260> there<00:03:41.440> we<00:03:41.680> got

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
but two fingers width so there we got

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.009 
but two fingers width so there we got
battery<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.889> then<00:03:45.549> finally<00:03:46.060> we<00:03:46.180> have<00:03:46.420> the

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
battery and then finally we have the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.660 
battery and then finally we have the
unit<00:03:47.350> itself

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.000

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
there and what else do we have we have I

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.930 
there and what else do we have we have I
believe<00:05:40.940> some<00:05:41.450> ports<00:05:41.870> here<00:05:42.160> got<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.340> HDMI

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
believe some ports here got the HDMI

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.390 
believe some ports here got the HDMI
port<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.479> then<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.780> USB<00:05:45.200> port<00:05:45.470> got<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.250> power

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
port and then the USB port got the power

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.159 
port and then the USB port got the power
on<00:05:46.550> button<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:48.260> think<00:05:48.530> that's<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:50.570> there
