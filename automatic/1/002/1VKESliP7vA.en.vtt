 pasta with shrimp here I already have water 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.040
 boiling I will add 2 tomatoes 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 Two guajillo chiles already make seed 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.510
 four or five tree chilies 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 these 30 seeds just take away the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.950
 and then we are going to leave them for 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.950
 10 minutes 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.660
 and while the chiles and the tomato 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.020
 sew on this side can ignite the fire 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.350
 I'm going to put water to boil to cook the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 pasta past those 10 minutes and the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.560
 tomatoes burst and I'll move them to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.560
 the blender 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.350
 along with the tableware chilies and the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.409
 tree chilies 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.170
 the water came to a boil 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.060
 I'm going to just add salt and I like it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 just use it if you like it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 put garlic talking peppers can 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 do it without any problem too and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.570
 I'm going to put the pasta 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.250
 can use fettuccine and noodles 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.549
 spaghetti the one that finds not the one that more 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.909
 like is the use and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.069
 we leave these our little ones 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.490
 Band-aids are going to bend and go to 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.069
 go putting and you know that in 12 minutes 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.740
 this list of this pasta and while the 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.969
 pasta is cooking we return here the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.090
 blender 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.280
 it would be necessary to add acidic cream of that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 we use for lunches and sandwiches 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.430
 of that same and we put Ivan 3 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.609
 heaping tablespoons 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.760
 Now I 'm going to put the marinade on a 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:21.629
 latita de chipotle chile for now only 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.549
 I use the marinade then liquefy 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.980
 we try and if we believe that you have to 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.379
 be more spicy if we like things 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.010
 we can already put half of a 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.530
 chile chipotle or a whole chile full 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.000
 then I will add salt that fits 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.840
 seasoned 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.240
 his touch of pepper and a clove of garlic 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.180
 the smallest you find that you are 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.180
 they put and now yes to liquefy 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.180
 and we finish liquefying the test 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.420
 of the peaks or this excellent only 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.140
 it would be necessary to add a little more salt 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.050
 and we liquefy again and that's how we 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.290
 is now they feel a bit spicy 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.770
 do not do anything to her because this one we're going 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.780
 to empty the shrimp and the pasta 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.640
 now on this side 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.130
 I already have a hot pan I 'm going to add 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.430
 a little oil 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.430
 and a good amount of butter 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.290
 and since the butter is melted 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.740
 I'm going to add garlic and onion go both 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.740
 together 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.040
 Now we are taking care of the 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.730
 moving to be a site since the 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.440
 onion is soft I'm going to add a 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.680
 shrimp room that is what I have 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680
 here 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.500
 we give you a good stay da 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.800
 I'm going to put salt 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.800
 10 and lie 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.840
 the elderly I know they are regulated 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.970
 two or three minutes will take them 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.940
 and since the shrimp are fine 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.970
 cooked that have already changed all of color 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.150
 and none is gray as we can 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.760
 when they are raw if they want and if 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.880
 have you can take a little wine 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.880
 White 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.410
 we let all the alcohol evaporate 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.620
 and before all the wine is consumed 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.620
 white let's add the sauce 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.590
 we let it reduce the pasta a little and 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.590
 is ready and it is the right moment 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590
 add it 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.230
 we mix all the ingredients and 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.280
 last I'm going to add a bit of 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.280
 Dried oregano 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.880
 and this pasta is ready and the pasta 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.740
 I'm going to accompany the muffins 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.229
 to put in a pan to brown 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.990
 and since we have the golden bread we are going to 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.729
 take a garlic clove , we will rub it 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.809
 nothing else 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.809
 on both sides 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.759
 we do the same with the other loaves 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.990
 and in this same pan that is already good 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.300
 hot 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.820
 I'm just going to pass a napkin 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:53.110
 to remove the sachets from the bread 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.660
 I'm going to put butter 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.770
 that alone is already going to melt and is 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.150
