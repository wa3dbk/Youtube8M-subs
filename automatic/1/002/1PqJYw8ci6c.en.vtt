you<00:00:07.680> how<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:07.950> can<00:00:09.170> not<00:00:10.170> exactly<00:00:10.620> Hardware<00:00:11.190> fix

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
you how you can not exactly Hardware fix

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.520 
you how you can not exactly Hardware fix
but<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> software<00:00:12.179> fix<00:00:12.450> how<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.929> improve

but a software fix how you can improve

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.660 
but a software fix how you can improve
the<00:00:14.099> viewing<00:00:14.460> angles<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.299> Xperia<00:00:15.900> Z<00:00:16.020> yet

the viewing angles on your Xperia Z yet
this<00:00:17.670> has<00:00:17.820> been<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> common<00:00:18.390> complaint<00:00:18.690> from

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
this has been a common complaint from

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.310 
this has been a common complaint from
all<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.949> experience<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.640> owners<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
all of the experience at owners that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.769 
all of the experience at owners that
colors<00:00:22.320> tend<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.830> wash<00:00:23.039> away<00:00:23.689> when<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
colors tend to wash away when you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.679 
colors tend to wash away when you
actually<00:00:24.960> tilted<00:00:25.470> at<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> Oviatt<00:00:26.130> angle

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
actually tilted at a Oviatt angle

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.630 
actually tilted at a Oviatt angle
however<00:00:27.689> many<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> us<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.429> phone

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
however many of us do not use that phone

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.870 
however many of us do not use that phone
at<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:30.179> those<00:00:30.840> weird<00:00:31.380> angles<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:31.980> let's<00:00:32.759> say

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
at all those weird angles but let's say

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
at all those weird angles but let's say
you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> phone<00:00:33.510> kept<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> table<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you have the phone kept on a table and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
you have the phone kept on a table and
then<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> want<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.460> notification<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
then you want to see a notification and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.810 
then you want to see a notification and
sometimes<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.410> becomes<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.829> bit<00:00:37.980> hard<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> see

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
sometimes it becomes a bit hard to see

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
sometimes it becomes a bit hard to see
the<00:00:39.120> notification<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> washed

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the notification because of the washed

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.920 
the notification because of the washed
out<00:00:40.590> colors<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.420> they've<00:00:42.420> faded<00:00:42.600> away

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
out colors or the they've faded away

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.420 
out colors or the they've faded away
colors<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.590> brightness<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.420> firstly<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
colors and brightness so firstly if I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.709 
colors and brightness so firstly if I
have<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> pic<00:00:47.910> opened<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:50.719> one

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
have a pic opened up here which is one

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.590 
have a pic opened up here which is one
of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> built-in<00:00:52.489> preloaded<00:00:53.489> photo<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
of the built-in preloaded photo that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.889 
of the built-in preloaded photo that
comes<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> phone<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
comes with the phone so if you see the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
comes with the phone so if you see the
photo<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.710> let<00:00:58.829> me<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.370> bit

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
photo right now let me just a little bit

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.689 
photo right now let me just a little bit
so<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.039> set<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.579> normal

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so when I have this set to normal

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
so when I have this set to normal
brightness<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.510> adapt<00:01:03.930> light<00:01:04.409> conditions

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
brightness with adapt light conditions

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.399 
brightness with adapt light conditions
so<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> top<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.110> supposed
