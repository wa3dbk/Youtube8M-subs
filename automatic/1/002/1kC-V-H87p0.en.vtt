00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 and then good day to all his hits 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.759
 we meet today for the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.949
 first gameplay commented by myself 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.050
 on call of duty ghost by the time you 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.109
 see this video you will have to have seen 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 at least already a first video is at 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.539
 say yesterday normally this one is 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 supposed to be claude on Wednesday at 18 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 hours is normally yesterday Tuesday at 4 pm 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.680
 if you have not seen know that we have 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.079
 succeeded the first world did what 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 is simply a double klm in 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.770
 team directed by tonio 25 and the big 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 siblings brother siblings so a big gg to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 them 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
 by the way it took a little 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.320
 triple in team because of what I have 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 believe understand 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 jeanne was born the Marseillais was not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.140
 very very far from succeeding his 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.760
 also so in any case now 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 send storm members start 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.370
 one after the other to receive their 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.309
 game 1 since it's true that except for the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.310
 roster xbox all the other players 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.619
 did not have the game before the release 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.630
 or so the first ones got it 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.180
 standby but here is necessarily it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 was difficult to put 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.799
 gameplay side or another and it is therefore 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 here is in any case know that there 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.220
 begins to fall like hotcakes 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.780
 it's not ready to stop since everything 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.119
 simply call of duty season 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 ghost starts and has been at the ball has been 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.380
 opened one by tonio and the brothers to 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.280
 that of hospitals here is the big brother 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 slb brothers and a big gg to them for 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 their double klm in domination I can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.460
 to tell you that it is not obvious since 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.970
 simply we will discuss a subject 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.710
 how to make a caem strike the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.299
 more easily on call of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.850
 duty brat then you'll say oh there 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.079
 there but why already say that and it is 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.549
 well just because I can 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.799
 tell you to have tried it with the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.719
 team for hours and even 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.049
 days since we on xbox we got it 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.159
 still for two or three days 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.579
 moment i start you gameplay one is 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.890
 Tuesday 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.990
 so yes we received it Friday good on 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.429
 did not play Friday night Saturday we did not 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.349
 not played in the east so what does it mean 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.280
 it's 48 hours that con dry 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.290
 is happy dkm domination well put 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.879
 apart from the fact on xbox360 needs to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.959
 show you to those who were in 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.459
 live stream and were very numerous 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.680
 by the way a big thank you to 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.450
 you saw that we fell when 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.340
 we are very much very much against 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.500
 unknown big risks or in English 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.110
 they are mus the us blessed central hilton 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.870
 made dirty allies and so on and so on 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.510
 so necessarily buttocks optics 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.030
 also necessarily it is not against 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 we will be able to get out of the cases m 1 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.790
 apart from the op or the old 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.170
 papy penot he managed a little what 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.810
 to feed on a walkthrough and 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 and another one of those guys, but there you go 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.870
 I know there were some who were 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.840
 troll and the guys here it is once 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.510
 two Fijians actually here I have 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.180
 well insured but that he well I have 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.440
 managed my thin duvet but that's it 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.270
 also he could have done very well but the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 go out etc 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.090
 do not go too ugly saying 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.610
 yeah he sheepish and friends the powder etc 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.870
 it's his hunger it's nothing to see a sum 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.370
 it is certainly better than 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.250
 me 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.840
 here it is but it's nice we tried 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.650
 to play the teamplay at max because 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.080
 it's a livestream 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.190
 and we managed to do them before we 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.720
 succeeded it was not the goal but we 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.880
 did not want to lose that we did not want 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
 to lose we really wanted to represent 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.440
 this shows that rabies was present 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.239
 and then we have won the way 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.069
 of the game since suddenly they are 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.390
 mutate it left the game which he has 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.220
 left anyway I believe that from this 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.019
 that I thought I understood visited only two 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.510
 we were four wheels I believe 4 or 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.130
 5 that's for sure but hey I was just 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.530
 glad that already we do not take to 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.900
 spanking so here it was rather 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.190
 nice it's in livestream it was good 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.660
 child so again like I 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.239
 you tell me I'm not looking at all 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.010
 the squabble when I laughed at the 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.970
 fixed rating was it was really 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.890
 it was ironic 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.930
 that's it if I was happy it's pushed back 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.489
 it was a fidh duvet here on a 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.530
 very good player but here it was not 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.870
 of the kind or other lol I am stronger 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.130
 that far from him far away my idea 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.750
 so here I know that there are some 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.400
 some who have been seeing him in him 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.620
 basically saying she bought the defense 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.450
 have not had to abuse 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.890
 here is anyway it's fun 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.109
 to have been able to win this part 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.799
 so we end up on this gameplay 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.910
 who is on the prison break map 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.580
 this is prison break it's a gameplay 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.950
 directed by psycho who plays on the table 12 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.800
 silent it's a kind ak 47 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.080
 but on this version only at 12 the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.490
 mac version to 12 on call of duty kid 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.140
 he plays with the silencer with the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.669
 loader of large capes and trumps 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.060
 main he repeated 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.060
 so that certainly in English so 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.230
 1 you will put me rsa in the 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.930
 comments he has death silence 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.290
 tracker was aiming quick determination and 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.910
 after it's the specialist it's the map 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.389
 prison break I do not know if I wanted 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.480
 said on and in general melee in f &amp; then 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.790
 why the ffa is simply 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.350
 the game mode that will allow you to 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.660
 make it as easy as possible 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.700
 your cam strike besides look 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.620
 well how this gameplay will come true 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.479
 you see that from the beginning then we 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.550
 did not start you any 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.080
 he died early in the game and 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.729
 after that he ended up there 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.770
 started to make a kill right then 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.870
 now here on the left and see he 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.460
 makes that back and forth between the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.080
 left and right it's called the 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.850
 spawn management he in general scrum 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.889
 it's the most efficient way 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.600
 now in addition they in specialist he 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.370
 a good helmet is the most 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.250
 efficient the fastest to achieve 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.190
 a case m so if you want to achieve 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.729
 a peace m I advise you very 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.550
 strongly this mode of play in sight 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.770
 he does not move he takes as fixed axis 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.200
 there the little truck of the logs he goes a 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.050
 times left here he looks at whether a 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.820
 enemy up here share right behind a 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.030
 little shot anyway there at the middle y 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.610
 look at the hoya pearson handed over there 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.160
 there is at worst kills him irv to hear goes to 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.440
 left and he's going to do that that that 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.150
 that it knows that the first klm 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.250
 are very difficult in the sense that you 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.810
 so stress the first kaleme do not 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.630
 not looking archi like crazy about the 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.090
 life is already there properly riad and 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.370
 he does not just camp he stays in 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.169
 a more or less fixed spawn ie 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.150
 that he stays in an area 2 I 'll say 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.490
 30 meters and it goes back and forth 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.260
 and he's managing his spawn to pull out his 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.360
 first can am it is he who inaugurated 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.550
 the ball on rabies is the first to 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.280
 have it out on xbox good after 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.450
 actually dumped tonio he has 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.710
 had the game a little bit after because 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.479
 tonio it's true that in four hours it 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.180
 we slammed the first klm but hey 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.580
 that we knew it was not worth to togo and 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.020
 the shows we knew we knew 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.960
 point elsewhere at the passage should 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.039
 make a little video in his favor the 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.740
 bastard since we had made a small 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.280
 bet 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.590
 So that was really a little 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.000
 tutorial to show you and explain you 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.919
 how to achieve this anyway 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.729
 as quickly as possible people you 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.490
 go on f &amp; a and the cam strike unlock 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:06.710
 so ffh management has one time to 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.020
 right once left and makes you 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.419
 that it was not looking for rhj is 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.460
 everywhere you do this way you 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.590
 see that the cabem strike is coming 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.479
 quite quickly and easily enough 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.680
 so it was a tutorial on which 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.520
 work I hope you enjoyed it I 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.030
 See you soon for 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.919
 new videos 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.919
 it was our cats on the lease 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.939
 no
