having a church wedding and a long view

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.190 
having a church wedding and a long view
I<00:02:16.470> think<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.710> always<00:02:16.950> nice<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.200> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I think it's always nice to much you so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.630 
I think it's always nice to much you so
because<00:02:19.470> after<00:02:19.740> much<00:02:19.920> even<00:02:20.160> when<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> remove

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
because after much even when you remove

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.190 
because after much even when you remove
the<00:02:20.790> building<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.420> dress<00:02:21.660> will<00:02:21.810> not<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:22.020> so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the building your dress will not be so

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.040 
the building your dress will not be so
heavy<00:02:22.590> yeah<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.610> an<00:02:23.700> alternative

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
heavy yeah so that's an alternative

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.030 
heavy yeah so that's an alternative
that's<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.200> great<00:02:25.470> idea<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:28.440> second<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.980> will

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that's a great idea in second I will

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.910 
that's a great idea in second I will
always<00:02:29.460> like<00:02:29.700> ask<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.450> bride's<00:02:30.690> about<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.740> I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
always like ask the bride's about as I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.010 
always like ask the bride's about as I
said<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> team<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.820> guess<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.210> think<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
said the team I guess I think the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.590 
said the team I guess I think the
venules<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.670> things<00:02:35.940> are<00:02:36.090> at<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> teams

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
venules and and things are at the teams

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.000 
venules and and things are at the teams
that<00:02:36.720> should<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.320> factored<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.860> as

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that should have to be factored in as

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.340 
that should have to be factored in as
well<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.760> dress<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.960> if<00:02:40.170> you're

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
a specific material you recommend the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.950 
a specific material you recommend the
specific<00:03:32.610> kind<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.910> right<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.390> let's<00:03:33.660> say<00:03:33.720> for

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
specific kind of right if let's say for

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.080 
specific kind of right if let's say for
example<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:34.650> brightest<00:03:35.460> there's<00:03:35.730> more

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
example like for brightest there's more

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.380 
example like for brightest there's more
to<00:03:36.480> us<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.960> fatigue<00:03:37.860> slices<00:03:38.430> very<00:03:38.610> skinny<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
to us to fatigue slices very skinny and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.840 
to us to fatigue slices very skinny and
I<00:03:39.990> will<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.830> ask<00:03:41.100> them<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.460> wear<00:03:41.640> something

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I will not ask them to wear something

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.830 
I will not ask them to wear something
that<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.060> too<00:03:42.270> heavy

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
that is too heavy

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.000 
that is too heavy
instead<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.320> will<00:03:43.470> give<00:03:43.650> them<00:03:43.800> something

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
instead I will give them something

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.430 
instead I will give them something
that's<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.400> bit<00:03:44.550> more<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.300> then<00:03:45.750> when<00:03:46.050> use

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
that's a bit more like and then when use

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.660 
that's a bit more like and then when use
the<00:03:46.590> material<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.190> case<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.490> can

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
the material that the case you can

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.640 
the material that the case you can
create<00:03:47.850> some<00:03:48.060> bodies<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.840> gum<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.530> know

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
create some bodies on the gum you know

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.070 
create some bodies on the gum you know
the<00:03:49.890> cows<00:03:50.100> like<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.300> do<00:03:51.420> with<00:03:51.570> ruching

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the cows like you can do with ruching

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.570 
the cows like you can do with ruching
and<00:03:52.500> things<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.400> give

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
and things like that so that you give

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.520 
and things like that so that you give
them<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.820> bit<00:03:54.000> more<00:03:54.180> volume<00:03:54.450> okay<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.230> guess

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
them a bit more volume okay so I guess

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.080 
them a bit more volume okay so I guess
what<00:03:55.710> you're<00:03:55.890> saying<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.760> different

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
what you're saying is that the different

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.120 
what you're saying is that the different
silhouettes<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.080> tress<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.950> be

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
silhouettes of the tress it can be

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.770 
silhouettes of the tress it can be
tailored<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.550> different<00:03:59.670> body<00:04:00.030> types<00:04:00.390> exactly

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
tailored to different body types exactly

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.020 
tailored to different body types exactly
so<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:00.990> not<00:04:01.170> find<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.380> good<00:04:01.560> designer<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.280> get

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
so just not find a good designer and get

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.240 
so just not find a good designer and get
the<00:04:03.120> fair<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.330> think<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:04.200> point<00:04:04.440> again<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.830> for

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
the fair I think the point again is for

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.190 
the fair I think the point again is for
Bryce<00:04:05.430> please<00:04:05.760> try<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.060> know<00:04:06.360> your<00:04:06.510> body<00:04:06.660> and

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
think about like which are your best

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.340 
think about like which are your best
areas<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.600> which<00:04:09.690> are<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.870> areas<00:04:09.990> maybe

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
areas and which are the areas maybe

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.840 
areas and which are the areas maybe
there<00:04:10.590> are<00:04:10.650> not<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:10.980> nice<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.780> um<00:04:13.290> that's

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
there are not so nice so um that's

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.129 
there are not so nice so um that's
basically<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.030> process<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.750> guess

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
basically the process I guess

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.589 
basically the process I guess
so<00:04:16.829> now<00:04:16.949> it's<00:04:17.129> time<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.909> pot<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.359> get<00:04:18.569> a

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
so now it's time to for pot I get a
