00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
I want to show you this tool that I made

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.450 
I want to show you this tool that I made
it's<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.639> freehub<00:00:03.480> body<00:00:03.830> disassembly<00:00:04.830> tool<00:00:04.859> and

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
it's a freehub body disassembly tool and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.140 
it's a freehub body disassembly tool and
Shimano<00:00:08.460> made<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.790> it<00:00:11.790> wasn't<00:00:11.969> too

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
Shimano made one and it wasn't too

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.910 
Shimano made one and it wasn't too
expensive<00:00:12.420> but<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> problem<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.410> you

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
expensive but the problem is that you

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.129 
expensive but the problem is that you
just<00:00:14.040> can't<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.910> anymore<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:15.990> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
just can't get it anymore and what this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.900 
just can't get it anymore and what this
tool<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.600> a<00:00:19.430> lock<00:00:20.430> into<00:00:20.760> this

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
tool is going to do is a lock into this

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.240

twenty nine millimeters across there and

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
twenty nine millimeters across there and
I<00:00:56.309> found<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> thirteen<00:00:57.719> sixteen<00:00:58.199> dates

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I found that the thirteen sixteen dates

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.369 
I found that the thirteen sixteen dates
ox<00:00:58.770> socket<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.059> 21<00:01:00.510> millimeter<00:01:00.719> socket

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
ox socket or the 21 millimeter socket

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.619 
ox socket or the 21 millimeter socket
seemed<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.329> diameter<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.570> fit

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
seemed to be the right diameter to fit

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
seemed to be the right diameter to fit
down<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> 21<00:01:05.670> millimeter

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
down in there like the 21 millimeter

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.660 
down in there like the 21 millimeter
socket<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:08.119> twenty<00:01:09.119> eight<00:01:09.409> point<00:01:10.409> three

millimeters<00:01:11.670> across<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.610> thirteen

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
millimeters across and the thirteen

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.899 
millimeters across and the thirteen
sixteen<00:01:15.000> inch<00:01:15.990> socket<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.640> twenty

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
sixteen inch socket is about twenty

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.190 
sixteen inch socket is about twenty
eight<00:01:17.939> millimeters<00:01:18.479> across<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.020> fit

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
eight millimeters across so they fit

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.030 
eight millimeters across so they fit
down<00:01:19.380> inside<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.700> freehub<00:01:21.030> body<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.750> nicely

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
down inside the freehub body very nicely

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.020 
down inside the freehub body very nicely
so<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.159> how<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.930> made<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.369> wrapped<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
so now how I made this was I wrapped a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.749 
so now how I made this was I wrapped a
piece<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.450> masking<00:01:27.689> tape<00:01:27.900> around<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:29.189> with

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
piece of masking tape around here with

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.880 
piece of masking tape around here with
the<00:01:29.880> edge<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.479> slightly<00:01:30.780> blow<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the edge of it just slightly blow the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.319 
the edge of it just slightly blow the
the<00:01:32.880> top<00:01:33.570> edge<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.409> socket<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> used

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the top edge of the socket then I used

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.530 
the top edge of the socket then I used
my<00:01:36.659> grinder<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.530> grind<00:01:37.560> down<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.460> edges<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
my grinder to grind down the edges of it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.280 
my grinder to grind down the edges of it
down<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.890> level<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> tape<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.930> using

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
down to the level of the tape then using

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.069 
down to the level of the tape then using
a<00:01:43.380> file<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.130> filed<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> got

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
a file I filed it down so that I got

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.889 
a file I filed it down so that I got
nice<00:01:46.350> sharp<00:01:47.220> corners<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.570> little

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
nice sharp corners down on these little

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.630 
nice sharp corners down on these little
teeth<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.930> what<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> need<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> do

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
teeth down here and what I need to do

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.719 
teeth down here and what I need to do
was<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.840> notches<00:01:55.049> inside<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
was the little notches inside here on

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
was the little notches inside here on
the<00:01:56.759> cone<00:01:57.290> these<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.710> about<00:02:00.200> 3.75<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.619> 3.8

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the cone these are about 3.75 or 3.8

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.350 
the cone these are about 3.75 or 3.8
millimeters<00:02:02.759> across<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> had<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.369> file

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
millimeters across so I had to file

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.290 
millimeters across so I had to file
these<00:02:06.780> little<00:02:07.530> teeth<00:02:07.829> down<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.640> slightly<00:02:08.940> less

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
these little teeth down to slightly less

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.780 
these little teeth down to slightly less
than<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:11.340> one's<00:02:11.640> about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
than that so this one's about

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.309 
than that so this one's about
three<00:02:13.120> point<00:02:13.360> four<00:02:13.569> three<00:02:13.870> point<00:02:14.140> five

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
three point four three point five

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.360 
three point four three point five
millimeters<00:02:14.890> across<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.599> one<00:02:16.810> over

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
millimeters across and this one over

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.520 
millimeters across and this one over
here<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.430> about<00:02:18.840> mmm<00:02:19.900> three<00:02:20.079> point<00:02:20.290> seven

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
here is about mmm three point seven

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.890 
here is about mmm three point seven
millimeters<00:02:21.040> across<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.420> they<00:02:22.510> both<00:02:22.629> fit

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
millimeters across but they both fit

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.309 
millimeters across but they both fit
down<00:02:23.170> inside<00:02:23.799> there<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.159> these<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.700> teeth

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
down inside there so these little teeth

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.440 
down inside there so these little teeth
lock<00:02:26.319> into<00:02:26.950> these<00:02:27.430> little<00:02:27.730> notches<00:02:27.909> down
