00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.570

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.970
 and today we're going to show you where they can 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.650
 get one will know what a 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.990
 helicopter that costs 2 million the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.440
 military helicopter and good they will want 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.270
 go to this part of the map here as 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.310
 can you see that is the building of us 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.350
 they will be here then they will 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.620
 supposed to open the gates and everything 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.470
 that 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.510
 and weddings are supposed to be without 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.690
 no kind of resistance in question 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.620
 of the police or if there is resistance 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.620
 it would be minimal 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.730
 nothing follows him around here she is now 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.640
 in the gates they let you pass like 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.700
 it sounds 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.700
 this other space where he exposes 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.300
 it can happen like this 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.729
 anything anybody here that anyone 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.970
 be and as you can see they are going to see some 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.810
 stairs here let me save myself 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 perhaps 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.290
 there is a ladder here you keep going up 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.280
 because this statement does not dare 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.980
 ok nothing keeps going up until you get there 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.700
 to the ceiling and there on the roof you'll find 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.910
 the boxer that then this one if he does it with 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.900
 guys for the guys block the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.810
 gossip and all that and if you take it and if you 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.740
 you are going to buy from 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.740
 of the store is online on the phone 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.920
 it costs you 2 million 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.869
 and then what better the snook get it for 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.869
 the millions 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.810
 this time we have in the bazaar break like this 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.650
 the mounting window in the helicopter 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.650
 and we're motivated out there 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.110
 and as you can see we want the muzzle already 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.910
 throwing the rocker and all that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 I made this short video so they could see 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.349
 where to find them remember that it is here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.519
 in the building of light it is the same 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.129

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.379

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.510
 chavo jose the chip coats only 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.319

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.689
 go up the fast 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.689
