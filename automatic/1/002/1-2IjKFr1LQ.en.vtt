00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.019
 hi everyone guys and welcome well 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 found as usual on my channel 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.490
 I am always your 90 and like 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 you may well notice this is a video 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.449
 dedicated to the world of downhill a video 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.520
 that normally should find space 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 on what my second channel of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.939
 make yourself a little engraved in this 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 period on the second channel you can 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 find numerous videos dedicated to this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 discipline to this sport that is the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 downhill despite this maybe if not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.369
 pits still enrolled surely 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.870
 sign up because then they will come 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 uploaded anyway as usual video 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.760
 inherent in the videogame world and beyond 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 but anyway this video I don't have 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 decided not to do it on the second channel 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 because a video a little bit special or better 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 we can say a special descent 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.690
 because I go to devote to my friend 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 my friend luca who unfortunately had 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 a really bad one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 ugly fall on the bike that has him 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.809
 caused the fracture of three warns for 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.859
 so really a very accident 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.239
 seriously and fortunately we say bad 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.480
 it went well let's say now you are 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.129
 recovering and if it is certainly seen 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.080
 very much barrel so I go to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.909
 make this video for let's say 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 still have the opportunity to do one 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.900
 descent along with I know will not be there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 same as doing it live but there 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.770
 I wanted to make a video like that because 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 we were both really gasatissimi 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.740
 for this summer we were waiting for everything 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 this year we were there 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.540
 equipped we were and really worth 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.579
 ready to enjoy a summer dedicated to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.820
 down in a summer by bike together for 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.520
 have fun and unfortunately ended 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.799
 so a little prematurely a way 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 really bad indeed I admit that a 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.079
 the descents they followed in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 course of this summer I did them with 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.320
 sadness in the heart that's why 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.990
 however I really would have liked 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.909
 live with him and therefore everything 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.799
 guys this is a special descent 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.270
 above all dedicated to him in other words 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.070
 had pleasure in continuing the vision 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.600
 of this video now simply there 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.380
 will be this descent accompanied with a 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
 bit of music 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.240
 but let's say that 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 it is perhaps not so important that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.920
 actually you watch it is a video 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.590
 with a little bit we say so 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 in any case then as usual if 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.540
 please let me have a nice one 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.560
 lay always welcome for me but I guess 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.200
 also for this occasion also for 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.160
 luca e nulla I thank you guys 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.819
 for the vision 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.519
 nothing but this more dedicated phrase 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.519
 to luca from we hope to live even if 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.260
 a descent will still be a bit difficult 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.890
 together with this video 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.489
