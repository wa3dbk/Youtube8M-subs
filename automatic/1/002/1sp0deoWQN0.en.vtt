00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.110

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.940
 very important in this put a lot 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.830
 attention to some objects that you 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.900

 that would bring bad luck to your home 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 according to popular belief 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.290
 it was some houses they usually have 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.420
 sea snails as an ornament according to the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.280
 superstition these bring bad luck 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.680
 because they are animals 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.630
 extracted from its natural habitat 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.140
 They bring bad vibrations when using them 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.140
 as such 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.340
 the same story happens with those of 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.590
 horns and walls ornaments with fires 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.290
 of animals like carpets and so that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.030
 say the stuffed animals all of them 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.520
 they have the stagnant energy of the animal 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.660
 dead and obviously load a form 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.979
 negative in the animal dissected theater 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.479
 They bring very bad luck since the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.050
 animal is in contact with the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.210
 nature has to die on land 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.920
 have ashes of your loved ones before 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.860
 the re your own is bad because you leave us 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.460
 moored the spirit of the person must 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.800
 go away fake plants also do what 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.710
 his will generate discouragement and depression what 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.119
 same happens with withered flowers 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.399
 put desire because if you are a lover of 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.440
 fish have them locked in an aquarium 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.899
 water is not good 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.150
 accumulates negative energies both for your 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.160
 environment as for the animals 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.430
 it's good to keep tropical fish 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.900
 or turtles inside those tanks 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.480
 tiny because they are not in a 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.490
 attractive environment and good for them 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.440
 for an ecological thing but also for 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.370
 an energetic thing the energy of 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.370
 animal concentrates focuses and does not 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.920
 expand the flows 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.780
 a classic is the broken mirror can not 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 look in an article that is said 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.940
 is the reflection of the soul the same happens 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.190
 with the broken photographs in the case of 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.620
 the crooked pictures procuring but 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.810
 also keep them interested in 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.700
 generate the broken items do not contribute to 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.680
 the new lives that happens according to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.050
 disciplines like feng shui by 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.920
 example with the broken utensils glasses and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.230
 dishes 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.450
 besides the knives keep in mind that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.800
 being a weapon are not welcome as 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.560
 present 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.540
 it's not good, it's better to vote, it 's better 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.120
 the vote even if you left a game of 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.970
 Dishware totally different from each other is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.550

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.990
 only for one thing of danger 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.990
 also in a snow thing 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.250
 I recommend you also not have cactus 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.230
 inside the house as well as plants with 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.630
 thorns last and most 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.180
 particular is that you should not save 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.460
 broken underwear this because I'm 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.709
 elevation and cause of recreation with 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.900
