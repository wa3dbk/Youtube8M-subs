when I was 2 years old my parents gave
me<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.309> book<00:00:15.490> on<00:00:15.670> dinosaurs<00:00:16.119> and<00:00:16.570> I<00:00:16.689> was

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.810 
me a book on dinosaurs and I was
captivated<00:00:17.290> but<00:00:18.160> I<00:00:18.189> was<00:00:18.430> particularly

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
captivated but I was particularly

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.380 
captivated but I was particularly
entranced<00:00:19.689> by<00:00:19.779> t-rex<00:00:20.380> and<00:00:20.790> that<00:00:21.790> interest

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
entranced by t-rex and that interest

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.839 
entranced by t-rex and that interest
since<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.320> happened<00:00:23.770> early<00:00:24.099> in<00:00:24.310> my<00:00:24.460> childhood

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
since it happened early in my childhood

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.940 
since it happened early in my childhood
very<00:00:25.180> early<00:00:25.540> that<00:00:25.810> stuck<00:00:26.110> and<00:00:26.649> I've<00:00:26.800> been

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
very early that stuck and I've been

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.909 
very early that stuck and I've been
working<00:00:27.369> on<00:00:27.489> these<00:00:27.759> animals<00:00:28.239> since<00:00:28.509> 1993<00:00:29.349> I

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
working on these animals since 1993 I

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.880 
working on these animals since 1993 I
did<00:00:30.279> an<00:00:30.399> intense<00:00:30.759> study<00:00:31.119> on<00:00:31.270> them<00:00:31.570> I<00:00:31.809> worked<00:00:32.739> on

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
did an intense study on them I worked on

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.310 
did an intense study on them I worked on
aspects<00:00:33.520> of<00:00:33.790> their<00:00:34.180> growth<00:00:34.510> drawing<00:00:34.840> master's

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.870 
thesis and really ran with that torch
for<00:00:39.550> my<00:00:39.670> PhD<00:00:39.970> or<00:00:40.780> I<00:00:40.840> focused<00:00:41.440> on<00:00:41.880> transfer

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
for my PhD or I focused on transfer

for my PhD or I focused on transfer
growth<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.540> evolution<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.710> how<00:00:44.830> we<00:00:44.890> can<00:00:45.190> use

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
growth and evolution and how we can use

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.220 
growth and evolution and how we can use
growth<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:46.120> learn<00:00:46.300> about<00:00:46.450> how<00:00:46.750> animals

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
growth to learn about how animals

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.650 
growth to learn about how animals
evolved<00:00:47.830> in<00:00:47.950> some<00:00:48.850> ways<00:00:49.060> the<00:00:49.240> growth<00:00:49.420> actually

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
evolved in some ways the growth actually

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.470 
evolved in some ways the growth actually
replays<00:00:50.350> evolution<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.220> that's<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:52.030> aspect

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
replays evolution and that's the aspect

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.260 
replays evolution and that's the aspect
that<00:00:52.510> excites<00:00:52.990> me<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.230> most<00:00:53.579> about<00:00:54.579> Frederick

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
that excites me the most about Frederick

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.780 
that excites me the most about Frederick
paleontology<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.470> that's<00:00:57.130> also<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.460> topic

paleontology and that's also the topic

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.990 
paleontology and that's also the topic
that<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.270> train<00:00:58.690> my<00:00:58.870> students<00:00:59.320> in<00:00:59.560> and<00:01:00.000> learning

that I train my students in and learning

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.870 
that I train my students in and learning
how<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.329> learn<00:01:02.020> about<00:01:02.170> how<00:01:02.770> dinosaurs<00:01:03.160> grew<00:01:03.700> up

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.429 
how to learn about how dinosaurs grew up
and<00:01:04.089> how<00:01:04.180> we<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.509> learn<00:01:04.689> about<00:01:04.839> evolution

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
and how we can learn about evolution

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.550 
and how we can learn about evolution

hands-on so I want to involve students

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.039 
hands-on so I want to involve students
completely<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.639> learning<00:04:20.970> experience<00:04:21.479> to
