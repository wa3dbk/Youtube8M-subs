00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
the traffic coming up the street and

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.600 
the traffic coming up the street and
look<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> left<00:02:08.369> look<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
look to the left look to the right and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.369 
look to the left look to the right and
wait<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:14.780> well<00:02:15.780> he<00:02:15.959> should<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.260> in

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
wait for will well he should be here in

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.470 
wait for will well he should be here in
about<00:02:16.560> five<00:02:16.920> minutes<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.610> even<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:18.330> he's<00:02:18.450> not

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
about five minutes but even if he's not

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:42.010 
about five minutes but even if he's not
I'll<00:02:19.379> be<00:02:19.650> here<00:02:19.860> all<00:02:19.980> day<00:02:20.010> until<00:02:20.190> he<00:02:20.519> gets<00:02:20.730> here

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.420 

so<00:02:43.020> far<00:02:43.260> he's<00:02:43.440> an<00:02:43.500> hour<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.770> half<00:02:43.920> late

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so far he's an hour and a half late

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.280 
so far he's an hour and a half late
so<00:02:44.670> chances<00:02:45.569> aren't<00:02:45.840> real<00:02:45.989> good<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.200> him

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
so chances aren't real good of him

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.390 
so chances aren't real good of him
stopping<00:02:46.530> when<00:02:46.739> he<00:02:46.800> gets<00:02:46.980> here<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.310> he's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
stopping when he gets here because he's
