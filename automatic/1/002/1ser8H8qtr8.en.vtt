 and well, we continue in the hairdressing salon 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.570
 I live and I wanted to take this little 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 space that I have and the opportunity to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.670
 to be able to talk with all of you to heart 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.300
 open in these last weeks I've 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.270
 found involved in different 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.240
 types 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.789
 of media themes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.520
 and me when this kind of thing happens to me 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:39.150
 in general I always do not want 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 not to get into an opinion I say take me to 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.490
 Silence am a working person who 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.140
 have a wonderful family and the 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.720
 truth that I say power not after a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.720
 news that may come to pass what 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.840
 it happens ni and what I always treat myself and the 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.910
 people who accompany me my family is from 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.320
 do not see that kind of stuff things that still 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.560
 they can not hurt us 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.470
 It has been my home after a long day 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.010
 of work as always 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.870
 that wonderful program I left I did 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.630
 different things to khamissi cost 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.670
 silver like any mom and fortune teller 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 beautiful was the sun to walk the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.810
 streets enjoying with them the truth 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 that is very are things that I enjoy that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 they love 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.380
 I still do not know the bathrooms like the whole tuna 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 active very armed with them I always say 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.930
 When I work less, I try to be very 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.390
 present then the veils we bathe with 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 Pablo prepared the dinner prepares the food 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.399
 of them with you surely as 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.920
 The whole family observed the table as 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.610
 we see the four as a family one night 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.610
 perfect 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 and we finished dinner 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.080
 I take my children that we take with Pablo 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.390
 in our bedroom because in general 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.890
 Now they love being with us 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.000
 like to spend a lot of time in our bed 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.800
 play have fun 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.420
 then we take this little time 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 to be with them for 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.050
 nourish us telling us of love and set aside 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.800
 we in family watching TV and 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.140
 dis having a pleasant moment 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.360
 at this moment I say let's look at something like that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.330
 playing a little with paulson and the one with 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.010
 isabella and I put blessed tv range that I 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.720
 I like fun I love it I love it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.310
 see this I think they make reports 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.700
 funny I say to go to bed with 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.530
 a little bit of joy not then while 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.960
 is going with pulleys and in a moment 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.700
 present the report of a supposed 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.210
 fight that I have with the Lord 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210
 marcelo polino 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.540
 I never saw I had not looked at anything 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.650
 what had happened had not looked where 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.590
 I am totally honest 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.910
 so 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 with my son in arms 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.040
 I listen carefully 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.390
 the whole report 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.390
 while I listened 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.159
 I got the blood 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.110
 Blood is me 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.390
 I just had my son almost could not 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.000
 to hold 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.000
 because I felt like arms 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.370
 I said I will not change 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.370
 for my surprise 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.629
 the techno ended there he continued with 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.640
 a statement from the viviana driver 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.989
 hoary where he said he loved that 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.209
 he had fun because it was a fight of two 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.209
 almost very loose body types 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.320
 SW 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.710
 at this time I already had my eyes 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.710
 full of tears 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.970
 they go back to the floor they do like a little 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.550
 download the different panelists from 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.200
 eri of the text as well as very superficial 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.760
 this at some point he had said no 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.400
 but we see him as a woman to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.480
 she but finishes the tail and being good 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.350
 and keys what's up that I'm coming 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.350
 to see who has it longer 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.970
 explode a disconsolate crying 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.799
 disconsolate 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.699
 in a moment almost did not hold it my 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.650
 son that was taking the wood and 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.160
 Pablo in that situation will take them to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.480
 your room 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.840
 and I found myself 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.860
 she is alone in my bed 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.800
 alone 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.020
 crying inconsolably 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.020
 you will surely wonder how I 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.850
 Of course , that's what they said, I think 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.440
 I really do not think it should be cheap 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.020
 for any person who 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.620
 that your genitals or that your sexuality 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.050
 put so so starkly before millions 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.050
 of people in central schedule 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.050
 television 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.540
 but what caused me 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.120
 deep 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.420
 pain 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.870
 what did he do 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.880
 that are tears 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.880
 they will not stop coming out of their eyes 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:23.149
 was that they did not give the debate that the 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:23.149
 situation deserves 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.139
 because you are talking about a person 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.300
 you are not talking about one thing 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.249
 they do not understand the biblical truth anymore 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.469
 I know what kind of society you think you leave 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:40.039
 vote for your daughter martina but clearly 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.599
 it's not the one I want for my children I 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.819
 I want another kind of country 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.729
 we are an example in the world of 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.900
 many things with law 22 of the 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.550
 human rights with the law of 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.150
 equal marriage with the law of 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:58.569
 entity but really in this country the 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.569
 equality does not exist yet you know one thing 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.390
 much of my life 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.280
 I felt shame 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.860
 I never said that 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.230
 I felt ashamed of me I felt ashamed 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.150
 to go to a bank to show my ID of 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.760
 ashamed of talking and listening to me 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.750
 the voice 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.980
 I felt ashamed of my condition 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.980
 and if there is one thing 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.639
 one day 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.060
 I admire the mirror 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.790
 he looks at me in the mirror 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.910
 and I said to myself ashamed of what 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.020
 but who knows what 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.689
 to be different 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:47.339
 to think differently from loving 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:49.980
 and I said never again I'll never feel 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:53.490
 that's why today 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.849
 I promise to you, madam 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.110
 president told him 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:02.059
 count on me I'm going to work 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.849
 tirelessly not only with your 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.770
 government with which he comes and with whom 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:10.669
 will come or with politicians who want 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.790
 listen but I do not want any 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:19.000
 man 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:21.220
 teenage woman or children feel what 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.620
 I felt we as communicators 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.260
 we have a duty then we had a 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.210
 person is referred to in such a way 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.020
 discriminative of another me in my 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.860
 program would say a little bit 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.860
 one moment 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.700
