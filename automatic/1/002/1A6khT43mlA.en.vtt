 that are playing and the console that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.119

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.880

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.470

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.650
 little more different could you help me like this 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.430
 they have to be your questions well 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.630
 specific 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.909
 do not forget to ask questions like 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.800
 I do not get the pokemon that I choose not to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.290
 works 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.750
 I did everything but set me off 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.800
 equal to the video and it does not work remember 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 that your questions has to be 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 specific questions that do not have this 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 norm will not be answered 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 I remember that the poker page gts 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.659
 sometimes between maintenance like this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.250
 that you do not have to worry if you get 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 an error on the page you just have to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.420
 wait a few hours or try a day 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.220
 next and sure will work now 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.840
 I think it 's happening a problem of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.479
 that the page 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.820
 has some the few people if you do not 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.200
 Leave if you do not get the page of little 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.210
 people like that in the video means 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.799
 that the page is in maintenance like this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.469
 that all they have to do is 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.340
 Wait a few hours or try a day 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.049
 next and this is going to solve 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.759
 seventh remember to read all the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.979
 comments that your problem then is 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 resolved it is important that they were the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.610
 comments because maybe someone had 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.980
