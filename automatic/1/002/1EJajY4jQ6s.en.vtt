this new super track with Karina Bradley

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.570 
this new super track with Karina Bradley
produced<00:04:18.609> by<00:04:18.729> larry<00:04:19.120> t<00:04:23.130> when<00:04:24.130> do<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.370> think

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
produced by larry t when do you think

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.780 
produced by larry t when do you think
well<00:04:25.389> no<00:04:25.780> we're<00:04:26.020> actually<00:04:26.169> we're<00:04:26.860> almost<00:04:27.400> done

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
well no we're actually we're almost done

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.870 
well no we're actually we're almost done
with<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.090> vocals<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:29.169> I'm<00:04:29.680> thinking<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.820> we

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
with the vocals so I'm thinking that we

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.810 
with the vocals so I'm thinking that we
will<00:04:31.150> probably<00:04:31.479> have<00:04:31.770> something<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:33.460> listen

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
will probably have something to listen

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.760 
will probably have something to listen
to<00:04:34.000> because<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.419> know<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.540> sometimes<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.590> like
