the<00:01:55.680> pimples<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.159> coming<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> it's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the pimples from coming so and it's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080 
the pimples from coming so and it's
pretty<00:01:58.290> mild<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> only<00:01:59.340> has<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.700> has

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
pretty mild I think it only has it has

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
pretty mild I think it only has it has
two<00:02:00.240> point<00:02:00.390> five<00:02:00.540> percent<00:02:01.020> stuff<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.649> acid

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
two point five percent stuff that acid

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.149 
two point five percent stuff that acid
so<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.119> definitely<00:02:03.979> if<00:02:04.979> you

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.700 
thing i don't like about is really all
kali<00:05:00.969> so<00:05:01.180> i<00:05:01.210> might<00:05:01.449> sting<00:05:01.719> especially<00:05:02.229> if<00:05:02.590> you

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
kali so i might sting especially if you

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.110 
kali so i might sting especially if you
have<00:05:02.740> scratched<00:05:03.189> your<00:05:03.370> pimple<00:05:03.759> or<00:05:03.789> scratch
