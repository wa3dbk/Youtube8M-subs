00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
so the first thing is that we change our

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.910 
so the first thing is that we change our

card we are running a GTX 760 which is
what<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.860> we're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
what you see right here and we're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.810 
what you see right here and we're
switching<00:00:47.190> over<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.260> 970<00:00:49.260> ITX<00:00:49.920> card<00:00:50.219> now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
switching over to the 970 ITX card now

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.020 
switching over to the 970 ITX card now
in<00:00:51.000> terms<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> storage<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.050> ran<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:53.030> 240

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in terms of storage we do ran with 240

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.630 
in terms of storage we do ran with 240
gigabyte<00:00:54.360> SSD<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:55.079> Kingston<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:56.100> terabyte

gigabyte SSD from Kingston one terabyte
of<00:00:56.820> course<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.360> storage<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.590> had<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.719> cable

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of course of storage we also had a cable

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
of course of storage we also had a cable
card<00:01:01.079> reader<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.370> took<00:01:02.520> out

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
card reader there which we took out

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.889 
card reader there which we took out
because<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.969> didn't<00:01:03.149> need<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.270> anymore

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
because we didn't need it anymore

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.670 
because we didn't need it anymore
now<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> casing<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> fractal<00:01:05.670> design<00:01:06.680> 6:05

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
now the casing is a fractal design 6:05

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
now the casing is a fractal design 6:05
case<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.580> course<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.909> HTPC<00:01:09.479> case

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
case which is of course a HTPC case

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.320 
case which is of course a HTPC case
gives<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> nice<00:01:10.560> fit<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.189> format<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.150> your

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
gives you a nice fit and format for your

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
gives you a nice fit and format for your
HD<00:01:12.630> PC<00:01:13.110> deeds<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:14.820> pretty<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
HD PC deeds but that's pretty much it so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.289 
HD PC deeds but that's pretty much it so
today<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.650> looking<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:19.009> GTX

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
today what we are looking at is the GTX

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.210 
today what we are looking at is the GTX
970<00:01:22.549> ITX<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> card<00:01:24.630> retails<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.100> 336<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
970 ITX now the card retails for 336 and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.440 
970 ITX now the card retails for 336 and
that's<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.640> card<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.420> three

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that's the card right there are three

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
that's the card right there are three
something<00:01:27.960> anyway<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:29.009> shorter

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
something anyway it's a much shorter

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.819 
something anyway it's a much shorter
thicker<00:01:29.939> card<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.720> fit<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.229> HPC<00:01:31.619> case

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
thicker card to fit in your HPC case

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
thicker card to fit in your HPC case
you've<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.040> an<00:01:32.189> 8<00:01:32.310> pin<00:01:32.520> connector<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> top

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you've got an 8 pin connector at the top

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.510 
you've got an 8 pin connector at the top
in<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> thickness<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
in there you can see the thickness of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
in there you can see the thickness of
the<00:01:35.640> card<00:01:35.880> comes<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.689> course<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:37.079> DVI

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the card comes with of course two DVI

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
the card comes with of course two DVI
ports<00:01:37.829> 3<00:01:38.490> display<00:01:38.820> ports<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.360> HDMI<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
ports 3 display ports and one HDMI so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.719 
ports 3 display ports and one HDMI so
you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.439> split<00:01:40.530> multiple<00:01:41.159> screens<00:01:41.549> at

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you can just split multiple screens at

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.730 
you can just split multiple screens at
once<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.630> pumps<00:01:42.899> packed<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.470> 4

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
once and it pumps packed with 4

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
once and it pumps packed with 4
gigabytes<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.540> ddr4<00:01:45.540> Ram<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.259> also<00:01:46.409> run

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
gigabytes of ddr4 Ram you can also run

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
gigabytes of ddr4 Ram you can also run
this<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> SLI<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> choose<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.299> if

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
this thing in SLI if you choose to so if

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.810 
this thing in SLI if you choose to so if
you<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.689> two<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> these<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.890> cost<00:01:50.040> about<00:01:50.280> 600

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you get two of these what cost about 600

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
you get two of these what cost about 600
should<00:01:51.030> pack<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.290> serious<00:01:52.680> punch

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
should pack up your really serious punch

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
should pack up your really serious punch
