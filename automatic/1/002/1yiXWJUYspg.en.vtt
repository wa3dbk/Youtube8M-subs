perhaps luckily I have a lot of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.950 
perhaps luckily I have a lot of
colleagues<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.560> read<00:02:19.920> both<00:02:20.960> developer

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
colleagues that read both developer

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.500 
colleagues that read both developer
sites<00:02:22.170> read<00:02:22.800> things<00:02:23.070> like<00:02:23.280> game<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> red

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510

you<00:02:26.490> shall<00:02:26.700> tell<00:02:26.820> me<00:02:27.000> oh<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.720> should

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
you shall tell me oh and if you should

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.270 
you shall tell me oh and if you should
look<00:02:28.230> at<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.800> should<00:02:28.950> read<00:02:29.100> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
look at this so you should read this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.690 
look at this so you should read this
also<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> try<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.920> look<00:02:31.920> at<00:02:32.070> some<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> DDC

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
also I try to look at some of the DDC

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
also I try to look at some of the DDC
talks<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.240> like<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.480> nor<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> game<00:02:33.960> we

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
talks I think like that nor the game we

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.470 
talks I think like that nor the game we
also<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.220> an<00:02:35.310> internal<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:35.700> within<00:02:35.970> Ubisoft

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
also have an internal one within Ubisoft

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.090 
also have an internal one within Ubisoft
that's<00:02:36.840> called<00:02:37.050> Busey<00:02:37.440> which<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.950> very

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
that's called Busey which is very

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.700 
that's called Busey which is very
similar<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.400> UDC<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.360> only<00:02:40.080> use<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.410> studios

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
similar to UDC but only use of studios

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.830 
similar to UDC but only use of studios
and<00:02:41.070> that's<00:02:41.520> also<00:02:41.910> very<00:02:42.150> good<00:02:42.300> because<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
and that's also very good because you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.910 
and that's also very good because you
can<00:02:42.960> talk<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.380> other<00:02:43.440> people<00:02:43.710> from<00:02:43.770> other

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
can talk to other people from other

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.030 
can talk to other people from other
studios<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.530> should<00:02:46.530> probably<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.890> better

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
studios so I should probably be better

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.130 
studios so I should probably be better
but<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.520> people<00:02:48.060> tell<00:02:48.510> me<00:02:48.540> when<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> need<00:02:49.050> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
but but people tell me when I need to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.710 
but but people tell me when I need to
read<00:02:49.260> stuff<00:02:49.500> no<00:02:49.680> normally<00:02:50.100> what<00:02:51.030> inspired<00:02:51.570> you

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
read stuff no normally what inspired you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.980 
read stuff no normally what inspired you
to<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:51.960> in<00:02:52.080> game<00:02:52.350> development<00:02:52.530> ooh<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:54.090> was

should<00:03:54.060> come<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.920> was<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:57.110> figured<00:03:58.110> like

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
should come and I was I figured like

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.830 
should come and I was I figured like
that's<00:03:59.310> never<00:03:59.489> gonna<00:03:59.730> work<00:03:59.820> everybody<00:04:00.510> who

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
that's never gonna work everybody who

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.380 
that's never gonna work everybody who
applies<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:02.010> John<00:04:02.280> Carmack<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.330> don't

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
applies is like John Carmack and I don't

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.900 
applies is like John Carmack and I don't
know<00:04:03.690> anything<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.470> comparison<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.610> figured

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
know anything in comparison so I figured

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.030 
know anything in comparison so I figured
I<00:04:06.030> don't<00:04:06.239> have<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.570> chance<00:04:06.750> but<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.170> applied

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
I don't have a chance but I applied

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.380 
I don't have a chance but I applied
anyway

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
and I got into it and they apparently

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.620 
and I got into it and they apparently
like<00:04:12.270> me<00:04:12.450> big<00:04:13.230> mistake<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.030> got<00:04:15.210> hired<00:04:15.390> and

like me big mistake but I got hired and
that's<00:04:16.290> that's<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.739> way<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:16.920> is<00:04:17.040> now<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.209> you

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
that's that's the way it is now that you

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.470 
that's that's the way it is now that you
work<00:04:18.450> with<00:04:18.630> games<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.170> like<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.410> expected

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
work with games is it like you expected

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.360 
work with games is it like you expected

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
yeah it actually is I think my biggest

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.620 
yeah it actually is I think my biggest
my<00:04:26.370> biggest<00:04:26.550> misconception<00:04:27.180> was<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.480> I

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
my biggest misconception was that I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.620 
my biggest misconception was that I
fought<00:04:28.320> everybody<00:04:28.950> were<00:04:29.220> like<00:04:29.730> gods<00:04:30.210> at<00:04:30.450> what

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
fought everybody were like gods at what

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.850 
fought everybody were like gods at what
I<00:04:30.660> did<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.170> I<00:04:31.470> didn't<00:04:31.710> know<00:04:31.830> anything

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
I did and that I didn't know anything

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.350 
I did and that I didn't know anything
and<00:04:32.630> that's<00:04:33.630> not<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.290> case<00:04:34.440> always<00:04:35.360> like

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
and that's not the case always like

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.210 
and that's not the case always like
everywhere<00:04:36.900> else<00:04:37.050> there's<00:04:37.320> very<00:04:37.830> good<00:04:37.890> people

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
everywhere else there's very good people

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.460 
everywhere else there's very good people
and<00:04:38.340> there's<00:04:38.550> less<00:04:39.360> good<00:04:39.570> people<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.170> general

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
and there's less good people in general

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.960 
and there's less good people in general
I<00:04:40.710> would<00:04:40.770> say<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.010> cult<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.370> very<00:04:41.550> high<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
I would say the cult is very high in the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.730 
I would say the cult is very high in the
gaming<00:04:42.210> industry<00:04:42.300> but<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:42.990> everybody<00:04:43.470> or
