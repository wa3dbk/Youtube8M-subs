the reason the Jetta has such a huge

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.550 
the reason the Jetta has such a huge
price<00:01:12.970> range<00:01:13.300> is<00:01:13.479> because<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:13.990> available

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
price range is because it's available

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.320 
price range is because it's available
with<00:01:14.680> four<00:01:15.010> different<00:01:15.220> engines<00:01:15.729> five<00:01:16.030> if<00:01:16.300> you

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
with four different engines five if you

with four different engines five if you
count<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.660> hybrid<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.259> Sentra<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.340> has<00:01:18.640> just

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
count the hybrid the Sentra it has just

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.480 
count the hybrid the Sentra it has just
one<00:01:19.110> still<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.530> Jetta<00:01:20.770> worth<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.280> price

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
one still is the Jetta worth the price

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.210 
one still is the Jetta worth the price

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.709 
taller adults won't want to spend much
time<00:03:54.219> in<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.609> back<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.909> either<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.180> these<00:03:55.359> cars

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
time in the back of either of these cars

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.629 
time in the back of either of these cars
but<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.379> low<00:03:56.590> roof<00:03:56.919> height<00:03:57.159> the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
but the low roof height the

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.909 
but the low roof height the
uncomfortable<00:03:58.299> seats<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.379> poorly

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
uncomfortable seats and the poorly

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.830 
uncomfortable seats and the poorly
positioned<00:04:00.099> armrests<00:04:00.909> make<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.479> a<00:04:01.569> bigger

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
positioned armrests make it a bigger

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.390 
positioned armrests make it a bigger
issue<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> sensor

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.520 

so<00:04:09.909> the<00:04:10.030> central<00:04:10.360> holds<00:04:10.659> a<00:04:10.750> value<00:04:10.930> advantage

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
so the central holds a value advantage

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.140 
so the central holds a value advantage
over<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.890> Jetta<00:04:12.129> but<00:04:12.610> other<00:04:12.760> than<00:04:12.940> through

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
over the Jetta but other than through

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.240 
over the Jetta but other than through
economy<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:13.780> ride<00:04:14.019> comfort<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.709> Volkswagen

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
economy and ride comfort the Volkswagen

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.490 
economy and ride comfort the Volkswagen
is<00:04:15.370> better<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.819> every<00:04:16.269> single<00:04:16.510> way<00:04:16.810> yeah<00:04:17.470> I

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
is better in every single way yeah I

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.599 
is better in every single way yeah I
couldn't<00:04:17.919> agree<00:04:18.100> more

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
couldn't agree more

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.849 
couldn't agree more
basically<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.239> Sentra<00:04:19.660> is<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.900> decent<00:04:20.320> car<00:04:20.680> in

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
basically the Sentra is a decent car in

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.010 
basically the Sentra is a decent car in
a<00:04:20.949> world<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.459> good<00:04:21.699> cars<00:04:22.060> here<00:04:22.660> is<00:04:22.810> just

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
a world of good cars here is just

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.080 
a world of good cars here is just
outclassed<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.830> ultimately<00:04:24.280> loses<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
outclassed and ultimately loses to the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:40.460 
outclassed and ultimately loses to the
constantly<00:04:25.630> improving<00:04:26.139> Volkswagen<00:04:26.860> Jetta

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.650 

yet<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.650> Sentra<00:04:42.039> outsells<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.729> Jetta<00:04:42.970> so

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
yet the Sentra outsells the Jetta so

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.370 
yet the Sentra outsells the Jetta so
what<00:04:43.840> gives

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
what gives

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.090 
what gives
I<00:04:46.620> don't<00:04:47.620> know<00:04:47.680> what

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
I don't know what

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.260 
I don't know what
what<00:04:48.250> does<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.789> and<00:04:49.060> then<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.570> come<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.020> say
