00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.490
To make a new map, go up to where it says
ëfileí and click ënewí. Next, we need

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.920
to make some ground for your person to stand
on. Click on the ëblock toolí on the left

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.110
hand side of the screen. Drag it out in one
of these 3 views (which happen to be 2D views

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.610
of your map). Once youíre done, click ëEnterí.
To see what youíve done so far, move your

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.890
mouse over the top left screen. This happens
to be the 3D view of your map, and press Z.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:42.489
Or Z, if youíre American. You can now navigate
around your map using WASD. Your map should

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.770
currently look like this. To add textures
onto it, go up to ëCameraí and choose ë3D

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.319
textured Shaded Polygonsí. This is the best
for most cases. NNGGHHHhh. This is the level

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:02.309
youíve made so far. To make a character that
you can play in the level, click on the entity

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:11.050
tool on the left hand side of the screen.
Click on the block you made. This is the person,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.440
what he looks like depends on which game youíre
mapping for. Iím mapping for Counter Strike,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.380
so he looks like a Terrorist. To play the
level so far, press F9. It will tell you to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.711
save the map, because you havenít saved it
yet. Iím going to call it ëfirstí. Click

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:37.140
ëOkayí to render your map. Well done. Youíre
now playing your first level... but OH NO

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.340
thereís lots of blurry stuff. To fix this,
we need to seal in your map, so that thereís

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.060
no way that it can escape into the BLACKNESS
outside. There are many ways to seal in your

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.900
level. For the sake of this tutorial, the
easiest one is to select the ëBlock Toolí

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.700
and to make a big block around your entire
level. Now, a lot of people will complain

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.170
about this method but for your first map,
it doesnít matter. Press ëEnterí to make

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.170
it. Once youíve made sure that everything
is inside, go up to where it says ëToolsí

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:24.090
and click ëMake Hollowí. Letís play the
game again. Press ëF9í. Click ëOkayí.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:33.430
Wait. Thatís much better. Your map now works.
Now itís time to make it look better. At

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.459
this stage, I recommend just making a small
level, using the ëblockí tool. To make more

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.989
blocks, simply drag out more and press ëenterí
when youíre happy. With this, you can make

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.870
an entire level. You can change the position
or the size of them by dragging them out,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.230
and dragging them around in the editor. Once
youíve made them, and you want to select

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.760
them again, click on the ëSelection Toolí.
With this you can select anything youíve

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.109
made in the level- you can move it around,
resize it... or delete it, with the delete

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.549
button. Next, letís try different textures.
Say you want a grass texture, click on the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.719
ëBlock Toolí again, and where it says ëbrowseí
on the right hand side of the screen, choose

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.779
another texture. If you want a grass texture,
type in ëgrassí into the filter box at the

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:32.180
bottom, and choose the texture that you want.
Some work better than others. Once youíve

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.430
selected it, just make the block as normal
and it should have the new texture. There.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.950
To change the texture of a block that youíve
already made, click on the ëSelection Toolí

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.189
and select the block you wish to change. Now,
click on this button here, ëApply Current

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.959
Textureí. With this you can retexture everything
in your level if you want. If you want to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.980
change the texture of one single side, click
on the ëToggle texture Application Toolí.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.790
With this, you can select individual sides.
You can select more than one by holding down

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.680
ëctrlí. Once youíve got all of them selected,
you can choose the texture you want to change

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.780
them to, and click ëApplyí. To make it look
as if your level is outside, go to ëBrowseí

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:34.389
and type in ëSkyboxí. Go to the bottom of
this list, and there should be THIS texture.

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:46.139
Choose it. 
Now, apply this texture to the outside of

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:54.300
your map. Like so. This world will now look
like itís outside. And thatís all Iím going

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:08.710
to talk about in this tutorial. Woops. I will
now make a small example map using what weíve

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:19.611
learnt. If you REALLY want to download this
map, Iíve got a link to it in the description

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:23.449
of this video. If not, I donít blame you,
you can watch some more tutorials where I

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.180
make this map look better. Itís all in the
description. Have fun.
