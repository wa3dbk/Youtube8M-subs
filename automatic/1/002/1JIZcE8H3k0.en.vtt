didn't really read the book honestly

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.110 
didn't really read the book honestly
before<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.010> movie<00:05:04.220> because<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.520> wanted<00:05:05.060> to

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
before the movie because I wanted to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.730 
before the movie because I wanted to
have<00:05:05.210> fresh<00:05:05.450> eyes<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.900> didn't<00:05:06.140> want<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.410> go<00:05:06.560> into

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
have fresh eyes I didn't want to go into

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.130 
have fresh eyes I didn't want to go into
it<00:05:07.040> was<00:05:07.340> like<00:05:07.610> they<00:05:08.270> changed<00:05:08.660> everything

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
it was like they changed everything

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.270 
it was like they changed everything
overall<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.740> thought<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.010> was<00:05:10.100> a<00:05:10.190> good

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
overall I thought it was a good

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.040 
overall I thought it was a good
adaptation<00:05:10.490> like<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.240> felt<00:05:11.540> like<00:05:11.690> they<00:05:11.810> stuff

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
adaptation like I felt like they stuff

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.050 
adaptation like I felt like they stuff
pretty<00:05:12.290> close<00:05:12.560> to<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.890> book<00:05:13.070> I<00:05:13.280> felt<00:05:13.910> like

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
pretty close to the book I felt like

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.030 
pretty close to the book I felt like
just<00:05:14.270> some<00:05:14.720> of<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.960> things<00:05:15.230> like<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.620> score

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
just some of the things like the score

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.520 
just some of the things like the score
and<00:05:16.400> then<00:05:16.520> some<00:05:16.760> he<00:05:16.850> was<00:05:16.970> acting<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.870> some

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
and then some he was acting and some

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.380 
and then some he was acting and some
stuff<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:18.950> was<00:05:19.100> just<00:05:19.280> not<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.460> huge<00:05:19.640> fan<00:05:19.730> of<00:05:20.000> like

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
stuff I was just not a huge fan of like

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.600 
stuff I was just not a huge fan of like
and<00:05:20.780> oh<00:05:21.140> but<00:05:21.410> nothing<00:05:21.710> like<00:05:21.950> that<00:05:22.100> portable

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
and oh but nothing like that portable

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.390 
and oh but nothing like that portable
thing<00:05:22.790> like<00:05:23.120> when<00:05:23.900> G<00:05:24.260> stuck<00:05:24.620> his<00:05:24.770> hand<00:05:25.130> into

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
thing like when G stuck his hand into

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.330 
thing like when G stuck his hand into
the<00:05:25.550> water<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:26.300> then<00:05:26.450> he<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.010> then<00:05:28.010> he<00:05:28.100> gave

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
the water and then he and then he gave

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.980 
the water and then he and then he gave
like<00:05:28.520> Clara<00:05:28.790> bubbles<00:05:29.210> then<00:05:29.330> he<00:05:29.390> put<00:05:29.540> his<00:05:29.630> hand

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
like Clara bubbles then he put his hand

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.190 
like Clara bubbles then he put his hand
and<00:05:30.290> I<00:05:30.380> was<00:05:30.500> like<00:05:30.680> this<00:05:31.250> is<00:05:31.610> so<00:05:32.030> odd<00:05:32.570> he<00:05:32.930> started

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200
