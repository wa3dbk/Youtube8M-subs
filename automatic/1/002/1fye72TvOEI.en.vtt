00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 GMV labs that a lab for 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 electromagnetic compatibility where 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.639
 one drives such tests where a handy 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.230
 has to go in and then it would be turned and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.580
 from all sides measured the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.650
 radiation etc 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.450
 in 1 meter distance part meter 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.529
 remove and ten meters distance though 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.600
 not anymore 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.520
 I measure them, who will stop then ? 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.619
 his mobile phone at a distance of a few meters 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.949
 ear 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 that's what nokia says because they are 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.289
 know that in the near field everything 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 possible is possible but who I have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.030
 Nokia Handy is not seen yet 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.000
 since so therefore there holding out outside as it 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.520
 The rule is yes and that is 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 exactly the problem the industry is here 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 in a giant pinch mill 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.480
 they know that too because they are liable when 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.280
 what happens and that it is only a question 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.980
 the time and now the scalar 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.140
 waves are recognized then breaks here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.809
 a building together at 24 5 ghz 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.780
 the microwave oven works like that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.210
 the microwave works because of the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 microwave heart sonja meat so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 to warm our food 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.570
 So he has to work in a frequency 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.189
 where meat is a particularly high 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.799
 absorption allows you to remember 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.470
 already something is going on here 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.280
 that can also give conflicts because the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 2.4 ghz are the biological window in 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.150
 we work in our cells 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 work and then it is clear what that 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:45.450
 means if I have a mobile phone with me 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.430
 2.45 ghz operate or wlan is also 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:55.200
 with 24 5 ghz or bluetooth i spark 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.960
 my biology into the craft and me 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.420
 Always say it is not allowed at all 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.659
 biology gets into the biological 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.619
 window one point that is not allowed 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.259
 and now you can see them too 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.250
 meaning of this research for ours 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.290
 physicist ours 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.010
 bigler developing such devices 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.590
 cell phones, etc. the blue-eyed and without 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.150
 any idea and without them 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.940
 with the wave equations with this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.920
 Waves physics have ever dealt with here 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.950
 develop such devices and thus full 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.740
 go into biology 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.590
 they make the mistakes they would have to do 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.500
 first teach in the training 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.760
 what is going on here 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.150
 that's why it 's so important 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.150
 research
