00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.160
 the mushroom the king of the wood fragrant 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.429
 and refined and therefore should be 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.960
 appreciated not only for their taste 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 important but also especially because 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.940
 they are a mine of mineral salts and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.460
 vitamins eo I recommend you buy 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.830
 of excellent quality fumes and always 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.769
 fresh because unfortunately the mushrooms 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 they face a rapid 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.070
 degeneration therefore today there 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.679
 we'll roll up our sleeves and we'll see 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.660
 together how to clean with types of mushrooms 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.570
 I chose champignons for you 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 of the porcini of the filters 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 these are also called champignons 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.649
 field mushrooms that fall into the category 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.379
 therefore edible from field and are 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 probably the most grown up children in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.520
 absolute is also easily accessible 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 to everyone because their price is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.550
 really content they are great both from 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.920
 eat raw salad both from 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.829
 mix with other points to prepare 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.149
 for example a mix of sautéed mushrooms i 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.189
 the hindu champignon mushrooms 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.960
 to rapid oxidation then once 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.549
 that we have to clean them must be 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 cooked immediately 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.970
 but let's see how to clean them then let's take 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.040
 a dude you see that from the side of the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 stalk there is still a lot of earth 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 so with knives I recommend 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.360
 ceramic knives we remove this 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.100
 part ok we find the part of the earth 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.619
 then we also return the stem with poles 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.780
 delicacy we take away very well now 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.509
 I advise you to proceed as the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.150
 peeling of the skin that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.150
 covers the smoke chapel 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.920
 there are those who decide not to do this 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:57.560
 operation only that I prefer for 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.539
 having a more beautiful mushroom is also called 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.350
 in short, we got a good movie 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.479
 clean 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.840
 now we can also cut it to 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.039
 slices of regular thickness in 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 this way and we will cut into slices also 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.299
 the gambit we have therefore settled 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.370
 for benign our champignons now 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.319
 let us proceed with the analysis of the points 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.780
 here we have some beautiful e 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.269
 very fresh ceps that fall into the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.489
 category of edible boleti mushrooms 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.829
 and are also valuable points from the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.349
 rather sustained cost are sold 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.829
 both fresh as in this case is 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.560
 in oil or if you do not 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.079
 porcini mushrooms are not 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.579
 oxidize in contact with or with the blades of 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.440
 steel at the time knives 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:52.400
 classic how to clean them then 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.530
 here we remove the excess soil 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.819
 trying to remove as little as possible 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.950
 clearly the part of the fungus and fungus 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.620
 in general they must not be washed 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.209
 because they are a sponge so they absorb 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.730
 plenty of water just that when yours 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.980
 baby turns out to be very dirty with earth 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.980
 clearly give us a wash 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:19.019
 to remove any other traces of 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.569
 soil we can scrape slowly 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.849
 of the surface of the fungus included 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.549
 also the chapel so or better 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.010
 still pass the smoke with one I hope 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.379
 a hundred wet I used a sheet 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.329
 of absorbent paper but that's fine here too 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:41.970
 they can be here now I have 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.920
 arranged a high then porcino and car 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.280
 Your stem from the top 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.150
 however if you want you can also keep 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.450
 both therefore both the stem and the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:01.950
 high net part and leave the shape of the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:04.260
 porcino then the last mushrooms are 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.420
 infinite I also called cockerels 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.549
 gialletti or chanterelles that appear 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.790
 as can be seen from a beautiful color 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.730
 amber are rather fine pines that 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.739
 these mushrooms also cost quite a bit 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.099
 they are excellent for preparing risottos 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.049
 or to accompany the meats you 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.720
 I recommend, however, do not exceed with if 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.430
 inter le if you decide to make a mix of 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.560
 sautéed mushrooms because they taste 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.599
 very strong that it could go to 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.220
 cover the flavor of other mushrooms 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:40.820
 let's see how to clean it remove the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:46.370
 traces of soil with a small knife 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.370
 we also try to scrape the chapel 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.379
 with a damp cloth or with a 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:57.620
 wet cloth in short, even the same thing 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:59.419
 we are going to remove the traces of 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.069
 soil also in this case avoided 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.389
 to wash them here the thing gets a bit complicated 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.680
 because in short we must unite with 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.949
 patience and slowly remove all the 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.039
 impurity 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:19.879
 we also pass the inside with a cloth 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:24.289
 wet and now we can remove the 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:26.810
 extreme part of the cuff and we can 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:32.330
 cook it directly or so 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.800
 cut it in him as we like and 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.310
 we proceed in this way up to 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.830
 exhausted all the more here is the 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.469
 our beautiful palette of fendi liste e 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.509
 cleaned one last recommendation first 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.340
 to greet you if you are not a grown-up 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.650
 Mushroom consumers do a lot 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.229
 attention to doses because all 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.490
 mushrooms including those considered 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.129
 fuels contain a substance 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.800
 tina call that in quantity that 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.960
 taken in exaggerated quantities can create 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.430
 also toxicity so I recommend it 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.430
 watch out for feasts
