00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:25.210
 I now want to solve this sum a second 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.210
 times 6 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.340
 We just learned how two major with 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.440
 multiply each other 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.650
 but here we see a fraction and a whole 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.010
 What number should something differently 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.550
 I think or is it the same 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.570
 well i'm going to draw it first 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.570
 so pancakes 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.570
 time with 6 dogs and we have to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.199
 multiply by half 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.829
 That means we get these six by two 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.829
 must share 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:09.750
 well put a line here and then it goes 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.700
 so it is half and that is three 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.490
 pancakes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.490
 so the answer here is three 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.170
 well what have we actually done 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 actually we can do this in the way 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.470
 resolve as before 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.950
 actually there is a second one here 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 times 6 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.429
 a the the previously learned that you have one 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.860
 write a whole number as a fraction 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.100
 just divided by doing one that is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100
 the same 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.500
 well then we can do this again but then click 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 on the method we have just learned 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:02.780
 6 one time divided by 2 times 1 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.780
 so that is six divided by two 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.780
 and that is 3 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.860
 it is quite different again 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.860
 write down 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.750
 a second time 6 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.040
 actually you can imagine that here 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.440
 six 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.160
 in the counter is therefore a set in the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.130
 counter 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.050
 menu 6 is also in the counter and the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.050
 denominator that is then the two 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:45.010
 that there are we who is in the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.350
 counter 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.230
 here you can write it down as 6 a the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.550
 but you also can't do it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.440
 because that one 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.360
 he doesn't do that much after all 2 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.940
 times one is that the two so why should 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.640
 you still write down 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.020
 now we can solve this easily 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.890
 six times one that is 6 the division line and 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.250
 then 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.250
 point 2 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.140
 well that is again the same as 3 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:24.209
 are in between 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:24.209
 and another kind of sun a fourth time 8 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.889
 well here again you can imagine those 8 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:34.510
 is actually on the counter 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:39.639
 so we do 8 times here that is 8 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.230
 and the denominator is then 4 and 8 that is 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.230
 same as two 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.689
 let's see if that is correct i am drawing 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:55.949
 quickly 8 circles 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:04:01.269
 5 6 7 8 and we did that in 4 pieces 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:03.459
 so so and that is indeed two 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.409
 well now know this he is an all some 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.859
 actually easy to solve 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.449
 for example, we are going to do a fifth 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.169
 meal 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:16.509
 15 that 15 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.880
 which we can multiply by the one 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:24.039
 because they are already included in the counter 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.509
 so once 15 is 15 and then the denominator 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.509
 is then not five 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:38.920
 1550 that's the same as 3 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:42.710
 an example a seventh time 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.850
 15 anyway 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.700
 once 15 in the counter that is 15 and then 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.160
 the denominator 7 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.820
 how much is that 15 divided by 7 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.510
 2 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:03.400
 remainder 1 so this is two 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.400
 a seventh 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.740
 another sum 3 times a half 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.120
 well here it is the other way around but I say 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.300
 just as easy 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.790
 those three there are actually three ones 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.710
 so we can get those three that 's just the 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.230
 counter hit three times 1 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:30.080
 that is 3 them, there it stays two 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.830
 and that is again the same as 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.900
 one and a half more 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.900
 5 times three fourths 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.950
 that 5 is in the counter 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.590
 so we do 3 times 5 is 15 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.630
 for the denominator we do 4 times 1 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.630
 actually but that's just 4 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.399
 and we can simplify that again 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.929
 sees here that the counter is larger than the 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:04.669
 denominator 

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:04.669
 15 divided by 4 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:17.689
 that is 3 remainder 3 so that becomes 3 3 4 the 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.689
 another example ten times 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.689
 170 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:27.349
 2 times 1 is 10 and 7 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:34.429
 and that again equals 1 3 7 th 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:43.819
 last three times 2 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.819
 seventh 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:52.480
 three times 2 is 6 and the denominator remains 7 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.480
 each other
