in<00:02:23.660> with<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> neon<00:02:24.380> pink<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.610> you're<00:02:25.730> basically

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
in with a neon pink and you're basically

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.880 
in with a neon pink and you're basically
just<00:02:26.150> woman<00:02:26.570> wanting<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.320> do<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> same<00:02:27.680> thing

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
just woman wanting to do the same thing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.680 
just woman wanting to do the same thing
that<00:02:28.070> definitely<00:02:28.790> looks<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.150> lot<00:02:29.270> better<00:02:29.510> when

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
that definitely looks a lot better when

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.180 
that definitely looks a lot better when
you<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:29.959> different<00:02:30.380> colors<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.800> stuff<00:02:31.010> like

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
you do different colors and stuff like

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.630 
you do different colors and stuff like
that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.090 
that
the<00:02:32.000> contrast<00:02:32.420> looks<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.989> lot<00:02:33.110> better<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.620> I'm

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
the contrast looks a lot better so I'm

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.220 
the contrast looks a lot better so I'm
taking<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.580> neon<00:02:34.910> yellow<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.570> rare<00:02:35.959> from

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
taking a neon yellow this is rare from

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.290 
taking a neon yellow this is rare from
Illamasqua<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:37.550> actually<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:38.000> putting

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
Illamasqua and I'm actually just putting

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320 
Illamasqua and I'm actually just putting
in<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.930> little<00:02:39.550> Center<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.090> use<00:02:41.300> a

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
in the little Center you can use a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.940 
in the little Center you can use a
different<00:02:41.600> color<00:02:41.840> for<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.380> brown<00:02:42.650> to

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
different color for this like a brown to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.500 
different color for this like a brown to
be<00:02:43.040> more<00:02:43.310> realistic<00:02:43.489> but<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.269> like<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
be more realistic but I just like the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
be more realistic but I just like the
way<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.750> yellow<00:02:44.930> shows<00:02:45.200> up<00:02:45.440> I'm<00:02:46.040> actually

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
way the yellow shows up I'm actually

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.070 
way the yellow shows up I'm actually
just<00:02:46.489> using<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.940> smaller<00:02:47.300> dotting<00:02:47.510> tool<00:02:47.870> for

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
just using a smaller dotting tool for

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.570 
just using a smaller dotting tool for
this<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.800> don't<00:02:48.950> want<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
this because you don't want it to be the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.490 
this because you don't want it to be the
same<00:02:49.730> size<00:02:49.970> as<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.239> petals<00:02:50.540> or<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.780> will<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.440> it

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
same size as the petals or it will or it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.210 
same size as the petals or it will or it
will<00:02:51.860> look<00:02:52.010> really<00:02:52.190> funny<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.300> guess<00:02:54.220> next

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
will look really funny I guess next

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.740 
will look really funny I guess next
section<00:02:55.670> didn't<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> green<00:02:56.300> polish<00:02:56.600> so

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
section didn't have a green polish so

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.810 
section didn't have a green polish so
I'm<00:02:56.840> mixing<00:02:57.140> one<00:02:57.320> with<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.650> kind<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
I'm mixing one with it kind of like a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.850 
I'm mixing one with it kind of like a
Jade<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.720> then<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.900> neon<00:03:00.530> yellow<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:02.680> if<00:03:03.680> you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
Jade and then that neon yellow so if you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.199 
Jade and then that neon yellow so if you
have<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> green<00:03:04.190> then<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.670> can<00:03:04.790> go<00:03:04.940> ahead<00:03:05.030> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
have a green then you can go ahead and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.780 
have a green then you can go ahead and
do<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.470> using<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:06.890> same<00:03:07.310> small

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
do this I'm just using that same small

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.270 
do this I'm just using that same small
dotting<00:03:08.570> tool<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.500> making<00:03:09.650> little

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
dotting tool and then just making little

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.789 
dotting tool and then just making little
leads<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.780> basically<00:03:12.079> just<00:03:12.290> making<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.650> big

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
leads you basically just making a big

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.319 
leads you basically just making a big
dot<00:03:13.100> or<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> big<00:03:13.549> glop<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.000> then<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:14.239> just

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
dot or a big glop and then I'm just

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.580

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.990 

I<00:03:48.290> started<00:03:49.290> using<00:03:49.439> it<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.709> other<00:03:49.860> day<00:03:50.000> but

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
I started using it the other day but

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.600 
I started using it the other day but
yeah<00:03:51.599> this<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.930> elf<00:03:52.170> tickled<00:03:53.040> pink<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.549> I

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
yeah this is the elf tickled pink and I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.789 
yeah this is the elf tickled pink and I
believe<00:03:53.819> these<00:03:53.939> are<00:03:54.090> only<00:03:54.209> like<00:03:54.450> $3<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:55.709> I'll

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
believe these are only like $3 but I'll

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.050 
believe these are only like $3 but I'll
save<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.099> guys<00:03:56.189> and<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.549> second<00:03:56.879> but

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
save you guys and in a second but

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.420 
save you guys and in a second but
basically<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.659> this<00:03:57.810> really<00:03:58.049> light<00:03:58.430> pink

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
basically just this really light pink

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.910 
basically just this really light pink
coloring<00:03:59.790> has<00:04:00.079> hardly<00:04:01.079> any<00:04:01.170> shimmer<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.739> there

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
coloring has hardly any shimmer in there

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.740 
coloring has hardly any shimmer in there
so<00:04:02.069> it's<00:04:02.189> basically<00:04:02.489> just<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.849> masked<00:04:03.090> light

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
so it's basically just a masked light

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.990 
so it's basically just a masked light
pink<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:04.680> looks<00:04:05.099> good<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.549> lot<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.819> skin

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
pink and it looks good for a lot of skin

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.670 
pink and it looks good for a lot of skin
tones<00:04:06.030> alright<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.079> next<00:04:07.140> thing<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.500> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
tones alright so the next thing is a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.129 
tones alright so the next thing is a
very
