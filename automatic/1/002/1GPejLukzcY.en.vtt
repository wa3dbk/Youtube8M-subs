like<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.750> dovetail<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.070> it's<00:04:50.850> pops<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:52.789> and

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
like a dovetail and it's pops in and

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.130 
like a dovetail and it's pops in and
that<00:04:54.030> push<00:04:54.750> around<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.590> right<00:04:55.860> mind<00:04:56.729> it's<00:04:56.910> a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
that push around in right mind it's a

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.990 
that push around in right mind it's a
safety<00:04:58.140> is<00:04:58.380> on<00:04:58.620> push<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.520> forward<00:04:59.550> for<00:04:59.940> the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
safety is on push it forward for the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.640 
safety is on push it forward for the
safety<00:05:00.210> be<00:05:00.450> off

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.520 

this<00:05:08.650> looks<00:05:09.570> like<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.750> would<00:05:10.840> be<00:05:10.900> super<00:05:11.320> heavy

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
this looks like it would be super heavy

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.330 
this looks like it would be super heavy
but<00:05:11.620> it's<00:05:11.860> not<00:05:12.010> at<00:05:12.220> all<00:05:12.340> it's<00:05:13.620> it's<00:05:14.620> very<00:05:14.740> light

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
but it's not at all it's it's very light

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.030 
but it's not at all it's it's very light
for<00:05:15.670> what<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:15.970> looks<00:05:16.180> like<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:17.620> important<00:05:17.980> to

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
for what it looks like it's important to

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.160 
for what it looks like it's important to
keep<00:05:18.190> in<00:05:18.310> mind<00:05:18.460> that<00:05:18.610> shroud<00:05:19.090> is<00:05:19.390> polymer<00:05:19.960> and

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
underneath it is largely air and you're

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.420 
underneath it is largely air and you're
about<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.900> hear<00:05:23.080> why<00:05:23.290> they<00:05:23.530> made<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.860> this<00:05:23.980> way

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430
