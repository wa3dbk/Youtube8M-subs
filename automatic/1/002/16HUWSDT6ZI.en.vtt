00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of the most frustrating goalkeepers I've

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
of the most frustrating goalkeepers I've
you<00:00:29.999> so<00:00:30.239> far<00:00:30.509> he's<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.019> highly<00:00:31.529> rated<00:00:31.739> but

you so far he's really highly rated but

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
you so far he's really highly rated but
for<00:00:32.789> some<00:00:32.940> reason<00:00:33.210> he<00:00:33.329> does<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.719> feel<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
for some reason he does not feel that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.840 
for some reason he does not feel that
well<00:00:34.350> he<00:00:34.559> feels<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.340> don't<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
well he feels like I don't know like a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
well he feels like I don't know like a
 70<00:00:36.750> rated<00:00:37.019> goalkeeper<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.649> me<00:00:37.769> he

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
 70 rated goalkeeper for me he

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.540 
 70 rated goalkeeper for me he
was<00:00:38.039> so<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.640> bad<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.679> it<00:00:40.829> may<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.129> down

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
was so so bad and I think it may be down

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
was so so bad and I think it may be down
to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> fact<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.120> he's<00:00:42.359> only<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.809> 6<00:00:43.109> foot<00:00:43.260> 1

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to the fact that he's only like 6 foot 1

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.259 
to the fact that he's only like 6 foot 1
I<00:00:43.500> say<00:00:43.769> only<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.640> tall<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:44.969> for

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
I say only as if that's not tall but for

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.910 
I say only as if that's not tall but for
a<00:00:45.300> goalkeeper<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:45.899> not<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.170> tall<00:00:46.469> he

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
a goalkeeper that's not very tall he

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
a goalkeeper that's not very tall he
couldn't<00:00:47.219> come<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.550> four<00:00:47.940> corners<00:00:48.300> he

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
couldn't come out four corners he

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.029
