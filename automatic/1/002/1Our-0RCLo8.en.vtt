00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.429
 fast in the sale of commodities occurs 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 that when paulo to have simpler 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.389
 always with 11 goals of balance that paulo 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 welcome to another episode in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 our series the turn of the pecs in the episode 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.010
 we were then with central denilson 9 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 nesi and luxou the left lateral limb 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.470
 to make Miguel also get and went to help 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 the team that i decided to do see sandy 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.720
 nabolisa maicon the such right and danilo 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.410
 castan in the center of defense the show then 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 fela nm rossi are the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 our two defensive pivots that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 integrate the best win wo and classes have 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 right to chopp the far left and in the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.980
 front of jackson tea martins in this was 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 so the team I wanted to do as 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.340
 I always ask you to leave comments to the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 team what do you guys think you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.079
 They sent teams changed much 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 interesting and some of you have lined up 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.280
 in some of my ideas is you 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 that I am what you understand 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 Jackson was really very 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.450
 they will also have the iturbe in the team or 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.670
 so the issue will only begin to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.310
 close to my ideas but tried and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 little that I'm going to play this episode follow 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.189
 there then the first game 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.560
 only I think our first planet 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 It's Rat Race is to be the key to the league 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 very strong Spanish who is capable of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.509
 to charge the stranger is Saturday and what I 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.509
 I think it's useful that it can unbalance fact 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.259
 of n 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.860
 jackson jackson jackson is done 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 chamartín the first to win is the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970
 fluminense fifa I like some not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.350
 It is much slower compared to the year 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.119
 past and this notes shown in the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.130
 gameplay veil but still won in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.439
 force crossed and martin in this head 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:05.930
 making the first one to boot in and 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.930
 left over and that's what it is 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.630
 My Photo 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.610
 she will play at the end of the first half 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.440
 then 1 to 0 result fair in my 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.500
 opinion until now we have to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.140
 to be superior we do not have many styles 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.970
 opportunities but we can take advantage 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.590
 the most blatant we had in ball well 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.030
 how of course does the second run 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:37.870
 part of the mother is already there 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:47.740
 otta focus of our plot n 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:55.360
 ok its not our still not getting the ball 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:03:06.430
 in the area and move and seriously what luck 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:22.870
 impressing left over and to the goal and I think 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:26.470
 I can not find one and so is 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.260
 then the end of the 90 minutes 2 to 0 is a 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.320
 more movies could even be the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.970
 the broader path perhaps 30 would be if 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.450
 what fairer 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.220
 I think victory is the most important is 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.160
 we will put the board so 20 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:51.940
 then we are then division 18 I think 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.650
 I think we 're going to do that just one 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.600
 tie in the next game to achieve 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:03.400
 what matters most is going up 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:06.570
 base divisions cox kimura da 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.570
 bundesliga also quite 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.110
 yang appear very well and defense and 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:27.270
 what made him teach and now 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:29.520
 property will win and it exists and is ultimately 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.390
 the first to be such a pretty game 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.300
 interesting enough with me a lot in 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.470
 field and tie you up so far 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.470
 let's see how the action of the gang 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.070
 jackson 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.830
 the awesome xii head win 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.560
 front of defense and footwear features 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.690
 also the shocks spent well done 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.120
 then the 1 to 0 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.620
 very well and practically continued 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.830
 we hold our passage to octave 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.830
 division 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:14.250
 Missing eike has to be card and we have 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:20.210
 here a whole own book is aa 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:25.020
 whole problem is that this year 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:31.970
 the attacker the fernando quinteiro does not forgive 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.970
 great book great accuracy and talent 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:44.040
 in front of me and passed and delivery is 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:47.490
 crazy is the final then of the match 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.740
 we are in vision 80 game in which 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:58.730
 we were well in the first half in 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:01.770
 second we achieved the victory and 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.770
 get the eighth division once again 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.240
 with the team and I'm enjoying it and it's 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.350
 late that he had not experienced either 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.320
 so very very cool and so and more 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.390
 once as we had two wins 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.340
 have right then open a google premium 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.440
 pack is then our eighth division 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.330
 We are going to start now for the next one. 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.020
 episode and we now have the 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.789
 opportunity 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.910
 find out what our two are 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:30.659
 players for the next team is that the 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:33.300
 to cut a cousin 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:46.190
 I did not have a great player once 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:46.190
 which falls to the extraordinary at 39 and 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:07:21.000
 so outside and max will be then this 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:23.280
 joy that I will use for these 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.930
