00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
player we've got the pace next to him so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
player we've got the pace next to him so
you<00:01:25.979> don't<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.400> need<00:01:26.490> too<00:01:26.700> much<00:01:26.820> pace<00:01:27.090> out

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
you don't really need too much pace out

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.819 
you don't really need too much pace out
of<00:01:27.479> Van<00:01:27.600> Persie<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.530> need<00:01:28.680> us

absolutely God like finishing centre
backs<00:01:31.439> we've<00:01:31.680> got<00:01:31.890> free<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> sweatiest

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
backs we've got free of the sweatiest

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
backs we've got free of the sweatiest
centre<00:01:33.030> backs<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.659> game<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.110> gonna<00:01:34.200> pop

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

don't<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> myself<00:01:44.520> confused<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.829> do

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
don't get myself confused there so we do

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.139 
don't get myself confused there so we do
need<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> make<00:01:47.250> sure<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.640> guys<00:01:47.939> are

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
need to make sure that these guys are

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
need to make sure that these guys are
the<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.840> rounds<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.409> order<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:50.040> our

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the right way rounds in order to get our

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.280 
the right way rounds in order to get our
left<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.090> wing<00:01:51.420> box<00:01:51.630> full<00:01:51.899> chemistry

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
left and right wing box full chemistry

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.690 
left and right wing box full chemistry
as<00:01:52.610> they<00:01:53.610> aren't<00:01:55.250> actually<00:01:56.250> left<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.579> right

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
as they aren't actually left and right

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
as they aren't actually left and right
wing<00:01:56.880> boxes<00:01:57.210> were<00:01:57.329> Hong<00:01:57.479> Kong<00:01:57.659> further

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
wing boxes were Hong Kong further

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
wing boxes were Hong Kong further
actually<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.710> behind<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> left<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.430> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
actually a right behind a left back but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.490 
actually a right behind a left back but
we<00:01:59.759> didn't<00:01:59.939> bother<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> convert<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.780> because

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
we didn't bother to convert them because

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.660 
we didn't bother to convert them because
they<00:02:01.619> do<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:02.009> pick<00:02:02.189> up<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.369> full

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they do actually pick up a full

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760 
they do actually pick up a full
chemistry<00:02:03.210> anyway<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.869> swap<00:02:04.229> these<00:02:04.469> guys

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
chemistry anyway when we swap these guys

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
chemistry anyway when we swap these guys
around<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.399> we've<00:02:05.520> actually<00:02:05.640> got<00:02:05.820> them<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
around so we've actually got them the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
around so we've actually got them the
wrong<00:02:06.270> way<00:02:06.299> round<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
wrong way round so if we do that you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
wrong way round so if we do that you
will<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:07.890> pissed<00:02:08.280> Jack<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:08.910> full

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
will see pissed Jack will get full

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
will see pissed Jack will get full
chemistry<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.660> then<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.050> pop<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
chemistry and then if we pop this on to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.160 
chemistry and then if we pop this on to
left<00:02:10.920> back<00:02:11.129> rockin<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> left<00:02:12.360> back<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.750> alibi

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
left back rockin a left back is alibi

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.730 
left back rockin a left back is alibi
and<00:02:13.319> he<00:02:13.410> will<00:02:13.560> get

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
and he will get

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860 
and he will get
for<00:02:13.890> chemistry<00:02:14.280> off<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.910> buying<00:02:15.360> guys<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
for chemistry off the to buying guys so

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
for chemistry off the to buying guys so
that<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> squad<00:02:17.220> lads<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.760> don't<00:02:17.910> know

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
that is the squad lads and I don't know

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.580 
that is the squad lads and I don't know
why<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.240> isn't<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.690> full<00:02:18.960> chemistry<00:02:19.380> let's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
why it isn't on full chemistry let's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.000 
why it isn't on full chemistry let's
test<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.340> out<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.180> go<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.810> there<00:02:22.620> we

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
test this out there we go and there we

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
test this out there we go and there we
go<00:02:23.310> again<00:02:23.520> she<00:02:24.300> need<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> pop<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> goal<00:02:24.960> keep<00:02:25.170> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
go again she need to pop a goal keep it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.840 
go again she need to pop a goal keep it
in<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:25.740> off<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.160> shall<00:02:26.370> pop<00:02:26.610> there<00:02:26.820> we

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
in and then off we shall pop there we

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.490 
in and then off we shall pop there we
are<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.390> our<00:02:27.540> five<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.080> back

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
are that is our five at the back

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
absolutely awesome why I'm now gonna do

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.870 
absolutely awesome why I'm now gonna do
is<00:02:40.140> move<00:02:40.320> over<00:02:40.590> into<00:02:40.770> some<00:02:41.070> goals<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.790> will

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
is move over into some goals and I will

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
is move over into some goals and I will
talk<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> little<00:02:42.270> bit<00:02:42.390> about<00:02:42.420> iron<00:02:42.870> Robin<00:02:43.170> and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
talk a little bit about iron Robin and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
talk a little bit about iron Robin and
whether<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.590> think<00:02:43.710> he<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.730> coins<00:02:45.000> so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
whether I think he is with the coins so

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
whether I think he is with the coins so
lads<00:02:46.170> come<00:02:46.680> back<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.130> I'm<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.310> gonna<00:02:47.520> run

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
lads come back and I'm just gonna run
