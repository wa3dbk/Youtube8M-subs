00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
it's still vague though we don't really

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.979 
it's still vague though we don't really
get<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.709> actual<00:03:48.480> physical<00:03:49.480> description

until<00:03:50.200> later<00:03:50.380> on<00:03:50.440> in<00:03:50.709> Ezekiel<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.340> even<00:03:51.640> later

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
until later on in Ezekiel and even later

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.000 
until later on in Ezekiel and even later
on<00:03:52.000> into<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.690> revelation<00:03:53.500> talks<00:03:53.709> about

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
on into that and revelation talks about

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.190 
on into that and revelation talks about
talks<00:03:54.280> about<00:03:54.549> them<00:03:54.670> too<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.000> they<00:03:55.959> stand

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
talks about them too and they stand

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.590 
talks about them too and they stand
around<00:03:56.530> around<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> throne<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.340> God<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:58.209> there

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
around around the throne of God so there

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.180 
around around the throne of God so there
seems<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:59.019> be<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.140> guarding<00:03:59.590> or<00:03:59.680> protecting

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
seems to be a guarding or protecting

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.789 
seems to be a guarding or protecting
kind<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.519> thing<00:04:01.330> there<00:04:01.540> i<00:04:01.570> think<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.170> know<00:04:02.200> god

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
kind of thing there i think you know god

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.440 
kind of thing there i think you know god
what<00:04:03.280> does<00:04:03.370> he<00:04:03.400> need<00:04:03.580> protection<00:04:03.940> for<00:04:04.269> you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
what does he need protection for you

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.509 
what does he need protection for you
know<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.720> more<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.170> status<00:04:06.100> kind<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.370> thing

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
know it's more of a status kind of thing

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.130 
know it's more of a status kind of thing
but<00:04:06.730> it's<00:04:07.239> still<00:04:07.299> really<00:04:07.600> interesting<00:04:08.019> that

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
but it's still really interesting that

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.990 
but it's still really interesting that
that<00:04:08.170> same<00:04:08.440> job<00:04:08.769> is<00:04:08.950> still<00:04:09.130> there<00:04:09.340> for<00:04:09.670> for

about how that sword may have split the
dimensions<00:04:36.430> yes<00:04:36.850> yes<00:04:37.210> loved<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.170> so<00:04:38.920> I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
dimensions yes yes loved it and so I

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.680 
dimensions yes yes loved it and so I
want<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.490> wanted<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.850> see<00:04:40.000> if<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.450> there<00:04:40.600> is

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
anything to that and I looked into it as

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.310 
anything to that and I looked into it as
much<00:04:43.210> as<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.420> can<00:04:43.480> and<00:04:43.810> when<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:43.990> really<00:04:44.230> get

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
much as I can and when you really get

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.830 
much as I can and when you really get
into<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.560> Hebrew<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.700> seems<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.330> seems<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.690> say

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
into the Hebrew it seems it seems to say

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.150 
into the Hebrew it seems it seems to say
that<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.200> I<00:04:47.230> talked<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.470> lot<00:04:47.650> about<00:04:47.710> that<00:04:47.980> in<00:04:48.070> the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
that so I talked a lot about that in the

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.370 
that so I talked a lot about that in the
book<00:04:48.220> as<00:04:48.460> well<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:49.210> we've<00:04:49.360> got<00:04:49.510> this<00:04:49.690> the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
book as well so we've got this the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.710 
book as well so we've got this the
Caribbean<00:04:51.370> with<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.550> flaming<00:04:51.820> sword<00:04:51.970> guarding

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
Caribbean with a flaming sword guarding

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.160 
Caribbean with a flaming sword guarding
the<00:04:52.810> entrance<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.820> Garden<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.940> Eden<00:04:55.630> and

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
the entrance to the Garden of Eden and

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.750 
the entrance to the Garden of Eden and
yet<00:04:56.800> since<00:04:57.070> we've<00:04:57.220> not<00:04:57.370> been<00:04:57.400> able<00:04:57.580> to

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
yet since we've not been able to

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.160 
yet since we've not been able to
perceive<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.240> garden<00:04:58.570> here<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:58.930> this

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
perceive the garden here in this

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.170 
perceive the garden here in this
dimension<00:05:00.070> we<00:05:00.460> may<00:05:00.610> be<00:05:00.670> talking<00:05:00.880> about

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
dimension we may be talking about

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.590 
dimension we may be talking about
something<00:05:01.750> an<00:05:02.680> entity<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.730> moves<00:05:04.060> between

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
something an entity that moves between

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.780 
something an entity that moves between
dimensions<00:05:05.380> yeah<00:05:06.100> yeah<00:05:06.580> they're<00:05:06.760> definitely

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
dimensions yeah yeah they're definitely

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.590 
dimensions yeah yeah they're definitely
extra<00:05:07.630> dimensional<00:05:08.140> and<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:09.760> believe<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.390> the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
extra dimensional and I believe that the

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.840 
extra dimensional and I believe that the
garden<00:05:10.870> itself<00:05:11.200> was<00:05:11.680> even<00:05:11.980> extra<00:05:12.370> dimensional

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
garden itself was even extra dimensional

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.900 
garden itself was even extra dimensional
and<00:05:13.630> I<00:05:13.720> i<00:05:13.750> see<00:05:14.140> in<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.350> book<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:15.460> reason<00:05:15.880> that

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
and I i see in the book the reason that

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.670 
and I i see in the book the reason that
you<00:05:16.210> know<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.360> lot<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.020> people<00:05:17.110> have<00:05:17.350> done<00:05:17.470> some

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
you know a lot of people have done some

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.350 
you know a lot of people have done some
amazing<00:05:17.770> research<00:05:18.220> on<00:05:18.610> where<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.000> garden

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
amazing research on where the garden

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.930 
amazing research on where the garden
might<00:05:19.660> have<00:05:19.780> been<00:05:19.900> located<00:05:20.260> or<00:05:20.580> but<00:05:21.580> the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
might have been located or but the

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.460 
might have been located or but the
question<00:05:22.090> remains<00:05:22.570> where<00:05:22.780> is<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:23.050> now<00:05:23.200> i

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
question remains where is that now i

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.890 
question remains where is that now i
think<00:05:24.250> it's<00:05:24.580> possible<00:05:24.730> it's<00:05:25.150> still<00:05:25.390> there<00:05:25.630> we

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
think it's possible it's still there we

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.180 
think it's possible it's still there we
just<00:05:26.110> can't<00:05:26.230> perceive<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.770> because<00:05:27.040> it's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
just can't perceive it because it's

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.220 
just can't perceive it because it's
extra<00:05:27.520> dimensional<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.300> i<00:05:28.540> talked<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.050> lot

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
extra dimensional so i talked a lot

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.380 
extra dimensional so i talked a lot
about<00:05:29.290> that<00:05:29.620> in<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.800> book<00:05:29.860> but<00:05:30.250> it's<00:05:30.700> it's<00:05:31.300> a

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
about that in the book but it's it's a

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.900 
about that in the book but it's it's a
fascinating<00:05:31.900> topic<00:05:32.170> and<00:05:32.530> one<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.890> love<00:05:33.190> yes<00:05:33.760> it

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
fascinating topic and one I love yes it

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.640 
fascinating topic and one I love yes it
is<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.210> we'll<00:05:34.330> pick<00:05:34.510> up<00:05:34.660> that<00:05:34.870> topic<00:05:35.320> in<00:05:35.560> our
