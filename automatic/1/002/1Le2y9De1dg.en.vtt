00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
you roll them as a cube as a dice so

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.860 
you roll them as a cube as a dice so
that's<00:05:01.980> one<00:05:02.220> I've<00:05:02.400> actually<00:05:02.850> folded<00:05:03.480> off<00:05:03.600> so

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
that's one I've actually folded off so

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.170 
that's one I've actually folded off so
and<00:05:04.230> they<00:05:04.350> have<00:05:04.470> all<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.770> crests<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.490> as

you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.480> see<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.220> it's<00:05:09.030> different<00:05:09.440> in

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
you can see and so it's different in

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.730 
you can see and so it's different in
this<00:05:10.920> way<00:05:11.540> Allah<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.840> makes<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.410> game<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.620> lot

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
this way Allah it makes the game a lot

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.740 
this way Allah it makes the game a lot
different<00:05:14.220> because<00:05:14.730> you<00:05:15.120> pick<00:05:15.360> any<00:05:15.660> three

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
different because you pick any three

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.880 
different because you pick any three
dice<00:05:16.170> and<00:05:17.390> as<00:05:18.390> is<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.660> same<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.500> English

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
dice and as is the same in the English

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.610 
dice and as is the same in the English
version<00:05:19.920> but<00:05:20.850> if<00:05:21.660> you<00:05:21.900> get<00:05:22.140> 2<00:05:22.350> summoning

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
version but if you get 2 summoning

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.640 
version but if you get 2 summoning
crests<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:23.670> you<00:05:24.240> get<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.540> summon<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:25.260> have<00:05:25.470> to

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
crests and you get to summon you have to

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.070 
crests and you get to summon you have to
choose<00:05:25.950> one<00:05:26.790> of<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:27.030> two<00:05:27.210> dice<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.720> summon

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
choose one of the two dice to summon

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.730 
choose one of the two dice to summon
your<00:05:28.200> monster<00:05:28.590> front<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:30.230> under<00:05:31.230> each

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.140 

monster<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.130> call<00:05:35.430> comes<00:05:35.700> with<00:05:35.880> its<00:05:36.000> own

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
monster that you call comes with its own

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.300 
monster that you call comes with its own
dice<00:05:36.450> so<00:05:37.170> I<00:05:37.500> assume<00:05:38.370> that<00:05:39.050> you<00:05:40.050> have<00:05:40.260> to<00:05:40.500> summon

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
dice so I assume that you have to summon

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.010 
dice so I assume that you have to summon
the<00:05:41.640> monster<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:42.150> was<00:05:42.300> appointed<00:05:42.780> with<00:05:42.930> the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
the monster that was appointed with the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.840 
the monster that was appointed with the
dice<00:05:43.200> but<00:05:43.710> maybe<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.070> can<00:05:44.220> just<00:05:44.400> summon<00:05:44.610> any

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
dice but maybe you can just summon any

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.120 
dice but maybe you can just summon any
monster<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.390> that<00:05:45.570> level<00:05:45.780> yeah<00:05:46.380> yeah<00:05:46.800> I<00:05:46.830> guess

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
monster of that level yeah yeah I guess

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.560 
monster of that level yeah yeah I guess
but<00:05:47.660> see<00:05:48.660> yeah<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:48.840> were<00:05:50.210> I'll<00:05:51.210> just<00:05:51.390> show<00:05:51.540> you

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.990 

and<00:06:06.860> there<00:06:07.010> you<00:06:07.100> go<00:06:07.430> that's<00:06:07.610> what<00:06:07.730> it<00:06:07.820> looks

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
and there you go that's what it looks

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.150 
and there you go that's what it looks
like<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:09.920> just<00:06:10.040> put<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.310> up<00:06:10.520> there<00:06:11.980> you<00:06:12.980> go

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
like so you just put it up there you go

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.740 
like so you just put it up there you go

and the monster of the sea has to go

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.850 
and the monster of the sea has to go
okay<00:06:15.500> problem<00:06:16.460> is<00:06:16.640> though<00:06:17.680> and<00:06:18.680> that's

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
okay problem is though and that's

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.290 
okay problem is though and that's
obviously<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:19.400> looks<00:06:19.550> like<00:06:19.670> on<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:19.910> dungeon

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
obviously it looks like on the dungeon

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.090 
obviously it looks like on the dungeon
this<00:06:20.480> is<00:06:20.690> the<00:06:20.990> sites<00:06:21.590> for<00:06:21.860> when<00:06:21.980> you're
