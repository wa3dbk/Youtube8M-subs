00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.059
 a state of siege hearing has been dictated with the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.369
 purpose of militarizing and establishing political control 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 to the sheer style of dictatorial regimes 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.000
 under the argument of pacifying the department for the minister of 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.509

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.530

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250
 sowing terror in the civil population 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 with the brazen purpose of doing away with the evidence of charges that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.470
 incriminate as responsible for an undetermined number of deaths and 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.010

 before the failure of the measure of exception 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.430
 that instead of pacifying the regions and investigating the tragedy of future 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.400
 serves as a pretext to execute a systematic repression and persecution 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.560
 politics to the detriment of the basic human right 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.060
