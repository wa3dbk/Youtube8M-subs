00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.810
 in this exercise we are going to draw the 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.810
 Isometric sphere given its radius 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.770
 As you know, the isometric system is a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.430
 system with three axes that are located 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.430
 at 120 degrees to each other and you see them 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.430
 drawn 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.490
 then with the help of the compass 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's take the measurement of the radius and the 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's put on each of the axes 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.129
 but let's do 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.129
 to draw a square in perspective 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 this square will be 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.710
 in the horizontal plane perpendicular to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.710
 vertical axis 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.090
 and this square is going to look like a 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.239
 rhombus square in perspective 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.239
 isometric 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.100
 the measurement of the radius 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.870
 in each of the axes in sense 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 positive and negative 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.360
 As you can see, the axes and their 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.360
 extensions 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.580
 once these measures are located we are going to 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.650
 catch and with you with squad and 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.030
 I square with this squad with 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.960
 built-in conveyor we're going to 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.580
 draw some parallels to the axes 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.750
 to draw 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.750
 the diamond we are looking for 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.580
 and we draw the first 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.800
 And here 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.800
 The next 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.720
 we already have the parallels to that address 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.070
 now we go with the other address 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.140
 we remember that we are drawing a 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.920
 square in isometric perspective a 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.090
 horizontal square 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.150
 in this horizontal square 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.390
 whose side has the measure of the radius that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.390
 they give me 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.380
 to be the circumference that is going to 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.330
 be a section of the sphere that we are looking for and 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.330
 said circumference will be seen 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.170
 exactly as an ellipse 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.480
 but we are going to draw it as 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.090
 an isometric oval 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.680
 to draw an isometric oval you see 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.920
 that we are numbering the points that 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.860
 let's use and now we join one with 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.220
 five 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.220
 3 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.430
 with 6 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.320
 4 with 2 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.430
 next we are going to draw the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.469
 horizontal 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.469
 the horizontal diagonal of the rhombus 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.569
 that will cut the lines 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.370
 previously drawn in two points 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.940
 that we call them with numbers 7 and 8 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.200
 then we already have the centers of 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.120
 the oval arcs 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.970
 the first center in two radius up 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.990
 three of three to four 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.070
 next with this same radius and center 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.070
 in 1 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.010
 / in 1 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.950
 radio up to 5 up to 6 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.410
 we draw the arch that links 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.410
 5 with 6 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.940
 we follow 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.270
 center in 7 and there we closed that stretch of 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.270
 curve 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.459
 opening up to 3 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.459
 and joining from 5 to 3 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.610
 and finally to close the oval 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.610
 inside in the radius up to 4 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.720
 we come from 4.6 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.900
 well we already have say the cirh the oval 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.699
 isometric that corresponds to the ellipse 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.729
 and that is going to be the section of the sphere 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.949
 now 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.210
 really the sphere nor its metric looks 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.800
 as a circumference but one 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.680
 circumference that as you are going to see is going to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.680
 have a radius greater than the actual radius 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.380
 of the sphere there you see what would be the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.700
 radius of the circumference and we 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.300
 as you are going to see, we expand to where 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.300
 You see in the drawing 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:26.010
 center on the coordinate axis we open 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:30.330
 until we say half a major axis of the oval 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.460
 and we draw our isometric sphere and 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.169
 we have made from an oval 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.699
 horizontal isometric could be 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.400
 vertical in both directions in 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.699
 perpendicular to anyone there you see and 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.930
 there we have the three squares 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.540
 we could draw in those three squares 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.610
 we could put together the three ovals 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.650
 isometric perpendicular to each 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.150
 of the axes as you see in the image 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.240
 so the three ovals would be 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.270
 isometric and finally the sphere 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.410
 isometric that envelops them all as 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.389
 you see that he wraps them all of that 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.729
 way could have the sections of the 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.210
 sphere perpendicular to each of the 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.210
 axes 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:13.469
 the isometric system there you have the 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:13.469
 sphere drawn in isometric system
