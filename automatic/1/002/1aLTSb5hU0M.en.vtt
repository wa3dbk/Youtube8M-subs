00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.930
 I applied my frontal clinic even 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.549
 better fps 15 on the finger it's easier 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.059
 so what am I doing to be enough 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.010
 quick 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.290
 I take four points will play and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 chin is quite practical as a background 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.950
 complexion because to dose 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.969
 that's exactly what they do 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.430
 I apply to law for me this is the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.300
 how to have the most natural rendering 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.489
 possible in fact 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.100
 then I say to the powders is with my 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.530
 msf of mac os and the reaching of the mediums 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.020
 for rabbits are wide enough this is a 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.800
 long and 30 sigma 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.460
 so I just placed on 1000 plays or 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.739
 anton the nose for the underside of the eyes I 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.880
 touch not yet I 'll do that later 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.550
 and the bottom and I barely touch then from 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.770
 fixed I touch barely less than two years 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.810
 for my eyebrows I see you again 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.250
 video that I did that on how to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.679
 close his site I have nothing 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.259
 under this video then I continue 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.409
 with the eyes by applying the bot's 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.889
 at mac in short supply 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.869
 well I dress it kodwa way enough 

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:27.310
 general is not trying to do anything 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.689
 perfect thing it's just actually 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.969
 to fade a little my eyelid 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.770
 which tends to be a little red on 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.380
 see a little bit but vain and that makes 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.819
 to hold a woman for my not very proud color 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:44.979
 I will use the lighthouse cork de mac 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:47.409
 which is a bit slightly I would say 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.079
 weakened and after each in his own way 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.759
 describe the colors in fact it's a 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.579
 color that I normally use 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.579
 to actually shield but my lighthouses 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.130
 between them but in fact it gives a 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.939
 color for very natural stone without 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.829
 so much really given color 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.999
 it's not bad in fact 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.520
 to give a little bit more 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.140
 definition if you want we can 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.650
 use 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.959
 the lighthouse oups but that of mac I like 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.260
 take with 1.35 for blind and there at 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.850
 blow there I type well the surplus is I 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.580
 just really put it in my group 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.900
 eyelids very slightly reported game 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.820
 in just a little bit more depth at 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.620
 look at the data a little bit 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.620
 more definition to the eye 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:41.250
 let me introduce you to someone who 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.840
 is very fit this morning is very in 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.510
 form he did not have to bark laval 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.780
 pernicious blizzard we eat the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:57.540
 socks who say hello yes it's 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.459
 he fixes so that's very fit this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.000
 morning little fixed idea and just with me 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.330
 when I make my videos he likes 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.489
 find them 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.670
 then comes the cne which gives ch for 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:21.390
 brighten the brow bone I was 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:24.030
 just a little bit that the ntma color is 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.490
 not that the eyeliner so for me it's the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.000
 super line up ultra precision of play 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.260
 l'oréal comes to shake before to have 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.750
 much of the color on the brush the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.780
 brush and not bad so I stay very 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.980
 near my arm say they and after 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:04:05.520
 I would like to build as and when 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:04:09.570
 malignant a little more precisely the 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.860
 metare so has a good layer so is 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.590
 always what they tend to picture a 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.350
 other then facing the dark circles 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.250
 contract of the all-makeup finish so 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:25.020
 I use the role of l'oréal always 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.060
 that I adore I apply myself with a 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.570
 brush with foundation or a brush 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.980
 synthetic hungry port I like it in 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.320
 does it apply with this kind of a 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.820
 jump because it's really very 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.460
 dense like color it's going to be very 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.810
 opaque 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.310
 so we really have the best render 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.380
 also you actually produce in these 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.380
 conditions there I would like all that with 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.320
 the beach brawl of beneficial 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.290
 a man had 40 a month so a 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.840
 brush to this logic but could 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.040
 use no in your remarks and 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.750
 then for the lipstick so I 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.240
 put a color that is quite flattering 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.160
 the one at 0,5 miss the collection 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.150
 chanel coconut rocks 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.150
 then we worked on the finger 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.060
 really he blurred it gives indeed 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.150
 more natural in fact we know it's 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.610
 the color of my students just in 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.740
 fussing a little bit on the edges 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.560
 this is the state brothers bloch highlighter 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.380
 3 in India for this I use this product 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.780
 from the cargo ship is the bluff coral 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.250
 beach b 0 1 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.660
 I take on the same fringe on which 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.570
 j 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.410
 learn and I come to put it as if 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.610
 at the beginning ja the image of bonsai and then 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:44.240
 I come up on cheeks and cheekbones 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.750
 and that really makes me the three actions 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.600
 in oil what to take a bluff 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.280
 highlighter do them this video has you 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.030
