00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:19.220 

that's<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.159> right<00:03:08.340> there

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.080 

and<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.800> believe<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:20.970> got

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
and I believe that that is it so we got

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.010 
and I believe that that is it so we got
to<00:03:21.209> end<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> game<00:03:21.950> really<00:03:22.950> quickly<00:03:23.840> got<00:03:24.840> all

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020
