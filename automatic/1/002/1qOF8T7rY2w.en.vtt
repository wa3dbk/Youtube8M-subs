00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello guys here is the second part of the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 coloring this happy lamb 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.349
 is the end result 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.509
 if you are interested in knowing how to do it follow 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 this tutorial once our 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 first layer of color is dry 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.220
 as you can see we can continue with it 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.859
 same method used previously 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 then the crayons are laid out first 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.090
 soft in this way then I go to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.329
 apply a dark color to the bottom and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.190
 I start from this intense blue and spread it 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.190
 on the lower part of my painting 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 with fingertips I am going to blend well 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.360
 [Music] 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.720
 to the superimposed blue of green I start with 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.630
 a light green that obviously mixed 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 blue will result in a lot of green 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.500
 very dark 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.680
 [Music] 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.810
 now I add in the highest part in the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.720
 yellow that I go to blend well always 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.270
 with fingertips and fade together 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.459
 to the dark green created previously 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.459
 [Music] 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.540
 and went on to color the upper part 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.720
 bra of the sky with a blue bell 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.720
 intense 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.610
 I will now resume the oil colors and resume 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.050
 white and I'm going to pass it back on 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.050
 the whole body of the lamb 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.470
 [Music] 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.810
 [Music] 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.340
 [Music] 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.610
 now with always in oil color though 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.440
 blue I go to cover the part that 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.950
 represents the sky 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.950
 in this way 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.140
 and I go on like this to pass the color 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.050
 in oil throughout the rest of the parts 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.419
 of my painting 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.419
 [Music] 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.740
 now I take a very intense yellow and 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.740
 I'm going to paint the flowers 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.270
 [Music] 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.820
 I also paint grass by giving 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.960
 vertical strokes in this way 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.960
 [Music] 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.720
 wanting a purple to yellow color created 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.720
 the shadows of the flowers 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.249
 [Music] 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.960
 [Music] 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.699
 and once I'm satisfied with the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.870
 coloring I'm going to take all the 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.870
 contours with graphite 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.220
 [Music] 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.390
 to remove the paper tape mi 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.390
 help with the heat of the hair dryer 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.690
 well guys the fake tissue paper is 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.849
 concluded what it seems to you 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.130
 I find it really nice for cables 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.250
 in the color the very bright and vibrant e 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.319
 because this style if you like a lot but 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.300
 very expressive of course 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.210
 absolutely unrealistic because 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.849
 an illustration but in short I like it 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.460
 so if you liked let the 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.380
 thumb up and let me know below 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.580
