00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
smaller unit but as you can see I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
smaller unit but as you can see I
couldn't<00:01:14.130> push<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.090> down<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
fact there's marks on the bottom where I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
fact there's marks on the bottom where I
you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.460> tried<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> hammer<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you know tried to hammer with a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.160 
you know tried to hammer with a
screwdriver<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:20.060> heavy<00:01:21.060> tool<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.930> try<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
screwdriver or a heavy tool to try to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
screwdriver or a heavy tool to try to
push<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.430> they

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
push those all the way in and they

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
push those all the way in and they
simply<00:01:23.909> won't<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.270> any<00:01:24.479> further<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.110> are

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
simply won't go any further so there are

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
simply won't go any further so there are
sort<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> unfinished<00:01:25.950> gaps<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> top<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
sort of unfinished gaps on the top and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
sort of unfinished gaps on the top and
the<00:01:27.210> bottom<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.650> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the bottom and as you can see that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
the bottom and as you can see that
bottom<00:01:29.340> cap<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.820> almost<00:01:30.360> identical<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
bottom cap is almost identical to the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.719 
bottom cap is almost identical to the
map<00:01:31.560> tank<00:01:32.810> same<00:01:33.810> size<00:01:34.200> same<00:01:34.770> kind<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.220> tapering

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
map tank same size same kind of tapering

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.690 
map tank same size same kind of tapering
same<00:01:36.360> height<00:01:36.750> same<00:01:37.350> o<00:01:37.530> ring<00:01:37.890> size<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.610> the

same height same o ring size and the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.539 
same height same o ring size and the
same<00:01:38.939> thing<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> top<00:01:39.710> it's<00:01:40.710> basically<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
same thing for the top it's basically a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.840 
same thing for the top it's basically a
clone<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.960> map<00:01:43.140> tank<00:01:43.470> only<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:44.340> quite<00:01:44.700> as

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
clone of the map tank only not quite as

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.600 
clone of the map tank only not quite as
well<00:01:45.030> fitted<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.659> far<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.259> difficult<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.100> put

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
well fitted in far more difficult to put

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.990 
well fitted in far more difficult to put
together<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.329> take<00:01:48.689> back<00:01:49.280> apart<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
together in and take back apart and it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.109 
together in and take back apart and it
has<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> top<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.869> drip<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.649> drip<00:01:53.159> tip<00:01:53.340> same

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
has a top for a drip get a drip tip same

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.410 
has a top for a drip get a drip tip same
as<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.479> map<00:01:54.780> tank<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.320> did<00:01:56.040> come<00:01:56.729> across<00:01:56.759> one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
as the map tank I did come across one

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.240 
as the map tank I did come across one
little<00:01:57.659> problem<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> pushed

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little problem with it and as I pushed

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
little problem with it and as I pushed
the<00:01:59.369> drip<00:01:59.700> tip<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.360> little<00:02:00.659> piece<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the drip tip in that little piece of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
the drip tip in that little piece of
metal<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> top<00:02:01.770> cap<00:02:02.009> went<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.540> way

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
metal in the top cap went all the way

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.600 
metal in the top cap went all the way
down

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
down

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.690 
down
and<00:02:05.600> I'm<00:02:06.290> not<00:02:06.350> quite<00:02:06.800> sure<00:02:06.830> how<00:02:07.040> short<00:02:07.580> of

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
and I'm not quite sure how short of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.999 
and I'm not quite sure how short of
appliers<00:02:08.060> I'm<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.990> get<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.410> back<00:02:09.740> out

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
appliers I'm going to get that back out

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.560 
appliers I'm going to get that back out
again<00:02:10.190> but<00:02:10.690> there<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.190> WPX<00:02:13.190> tank<00:02:16.570> given

again but there it is WPX tank given
those<00:02:17.720> details<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.670> pretty<00:02:19.880> much<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.420> map

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
those details this is pretty much a map

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.910 
those details this is pretty much a map
tank<00:02:21.530> clone<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:23.510> don't<00:02:23.990> think<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.350> tube<00:02:24.650> is

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
tank clone I don't think the tube is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.600 
tank clone I don't think the tube is
quite<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:25.460> finely<00:02:26.260> cut<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.650> don't<00:02:28.280> think<00:02:28.340> it's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
quite as finely cut I don't think it's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.460 
quite as finely cut I don't think it's
quite<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.910> same<00:02:29.390> material<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
quite the same material to get the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.160 
quite the same material to get the
different<00:02:30.620> colors<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.450> those<00:02:32.450> machine<00:02:32.870> caps

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
different colors and those machine caps

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.620 
different colors and those machine caps
don't<00:02:33.590> fit<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.070> there<00:02:34.220> very<00:02:34.250> well<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:35.000> drives

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
don't fit in there very well that drives

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.500 
don't fit in there very well that drives
me<00:02:35.780> nuts<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.740> really<00:02:36.980> hard<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.340> open

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
me nuts this is really hard to open

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.230 
me nuts this is really hard to open
really<00:02:38.510> hard<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.780> close<00:02:38.930> back<00:02:39.200> up<00:02:39.230> again<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.950> I

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
really hard to close back up again and I

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400 
really hard to close back up again and I
just<00:02:41.240> don't<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.750> should<00:02:41.959> be<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.230> way

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
just don't think it should be that way

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.090 
just don't think it should be that way
so<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:44.540> goes<00:02:44.959> on<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.440> but<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.830> think<00:02:46.010> that's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
so it goes on to but I think that's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.920 
so it goes on to but I think that's
because<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.480> two<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> half

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
because it is the two and a half

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.380 
because it is the two and a half
milliliter<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.970> there's<00:02:49.970> only<00:02:50.120> not<00:02:50.360> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
milliliter one and there's only not a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.180 
milliliter one and there's only not a
lot<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.630> room<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.080> there<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.560> juice<00:02:51.830> to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
lot of room in there for the juice to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.780 
lot of room in there for the juice to
sit<00:02:52.610> before<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.239> hits<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.630> ceramic<00:02:54.080> cap

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
sit before it hits that ceramic cap

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.370 
sit before it hits that ceramic cap
which<00:02:55.790> probably<00:02:56.090> means<00:02:56.300> i'm<00:02:56.510> getting<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:57.050> too

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
which probably means i'm getting it too

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.470 
which probably means i'm getting it too
much<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.739> there<00:02:58.120> probably<00:02:59.120> wouldn't<00:02:59.270> do<00:02:59.450> that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
much in there probably wouldn't do that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.780 
much in there probably wouldn't do that
on<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.750> larger<00:03:00.080> size<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.700> only

as<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.720> can<00:03:54.840> see<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.080> real<00:03:55.440> tight<00:03:55.980> nice<00:03:56.370> seal

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
as you can see that real tight nice seal

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.550 
as you can see that real tight nice seal
between<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.210> ce2<00:03:57.750> that's<00:03:57.930> pushed<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.380> there

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560

in<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.710> metal<00:03:58.980> bottom<00:03:59.310> these<00:04:00.150> are<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.540> nicely

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
in the metal bottom these are so nicely

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.920 
in the metal bottom these are so nicely
fitted<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.940> can<00:04:03.120> basically<00:04:03.300> pull<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
fitted that you can basically pull the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.780 
fitted that you can basically pull the
top<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.320> bottom<00:04:04.500> cap<00:04:04.860> out<00:04:05.070> with<00:04:05.280> your<00:04:05.430> fingers

now<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.240> not<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.630> they<00:04:06.870> come<00:04:07.260> undone<00:04:08.160> at

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
now this is not so they come undone at

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.640 
now this is not so they come undone at
all<00:04:08.580> during<00:04:09.090> use<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:10.020> have<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.290> wiggle<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.370 
all during use you do have to wiggle a
little<00:04:10.740> but<00:04:11.220> they<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.180> maintain<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.780> nice<00:04:13.050> seal

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380

the base to help push it out with the
tool<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.150> tube<00:04:33.480> is<00:04:33.750> nice<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.170> solid<00:04:34.380> much

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
tool the tube is nice and solid much

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.510 
tool the tube is nice and solid much
like<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.550> map<00:04:36.090> tank<00:04:36.420> tube<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.620> while<00:04:38.340> it's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
like the map tank tube and while it's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.590 
not perfectly even in how it's cut it
does<00:04:41.100> appear<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.580> way<00:04:41.880> when<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.180> put<00:04:42.420> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
does appear that way when you put the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.930 
does appear that way when you put the
nice<00:04:43.500> top<00:04:44.460> on<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.370> polished

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
nice top on and this is the polished

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.650 
nice top on and this is the polished
aluminum<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.790> while<00:04:51.000> it's<00:04:51.150> not<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.630> know

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
aluminum and while it's not you know

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.810 
aluminum and while it's not you know
perfectly<00:04:52.350> machine<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.070> probably<00:04:53.580> the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
perfectly machine it is probably the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.180 
perfectly machine it is probably the
closest<00:04:54.360> straight<00:04:54.900> cut<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.500> any<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.950> ones

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
closest straight cut of any of the ones

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.130 
closest straight cut of any of the ones
and<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:56.550> been<00:04:56.760> kind<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.090> sanded<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.930> looks

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
and it's been kind of sanded so it looks

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.380 
and it's been kind of sanded so it looks
very<00:04:58.560> well<00:04:59.430> finished<00:04:59.820> when<00:05:00.000> it's<00:05:00.210> all<00:05:00.360> put

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
very well finished when it's all put

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.550 
very well finished when it's all put
together<00:05:01.040> again<00:05:02.040> that's<00:05:02.280> as<00:05:02.430> easy<00:05:02.580> as<00:05:02.970> just

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
together again that's as easy as just

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.050 
together again that's as easy as just
popping<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:04.860> with<00:05:05.070> your<00:05:05.220> fingers<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:05.670> it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
popping it in with your fingers and it

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.930 
popping it in with your fingers and it
gets<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.660> tight<00:05:07.380> seal<00:05:07.680> past<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.340> o<00:05:08.490> ring<00:05:08.730> you

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
gets a tight seal past that o ring you

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.460 
gets a tight seal past that o ring you
can<00:05:09.120> see<00:05:09.300> how<00:05:09.480> that's<00:05:09.660> ceiling<00:05:10.140> around<00:05:10.410> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
can see how that's ceiling around the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.980 
can see how that's ceiling around the
plastic<00:05:10.950> so<00:05:11.790> no<00:05:11.970> liquid<00:05:12.390> can<00:05:12.570> get<00:05:12.720> through<00:05:12.900> in

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
plastic so no liquid can get through in

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.830 
plastic so no liquid can get through in
there<00:05:13.170> now<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:14.040> so<00:05:14.430> smooth<00:05:15.240> that<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.630> can

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
there now this is so smooth that you can

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.890 
there now this is so smooth that you can
actually<00:05:16.020> fill<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.790> with<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.970> top<00:05:18.180> off<00:05:18.420> make

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
actually fill it with the top off make

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.320 
actually fill it with the top off make
sure<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.260> edges<00:05:19.470> are<00:05:19.740> dry<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.340> then<00:05:20.580> just<00:05:20.790> pop

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
sure the edges are dry and then just pop

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.720

I don't need to mess with a syringe a

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.640 
I don't need to mess with a syringe a
little<00:06:07.880> trickier<00:06:08.330> getting<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.840> ce2<00:06:09.320> in<00:06:09.500> and

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
little trickier getting the ce2 in and

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.350 
little trickier getting the ce2 in and
out<00:06:09.740> because<00:06:10.130> you're<00:06:10.250> shoving<00:06:10.970> it<00:06:10.970> in<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.270> out

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
out because you're shoving it in and out

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.510 
out because you're shoving it in and out
of<00:06:11.450> metal<00:06:11.780> he<00:06:12.560> gave<00:06:12.740> me<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:12.860> little<00:06:12.980> trick<00:06:13.280> about

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
of metal he gave me a little trick about

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.810 
of metal he gave me a little trick about
sticking<00:06:14.390> it<00:06:14.510> on<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.720> nut<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.320> then<00:06:15.530> just

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
sticking it on a nut and then just

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.120 
sticking it on a nut and then just
pushing<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:16.880> center<00:06:17.150> pin<00:06:17.330> down<00:06:17.510> it<00:06:17.720> through

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
pushing the center pin down it through

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.380 
pushing the center pin down it through
but<00:06:19.130> even<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:19.550> I<00:06:19.580> think<00:06:19.730> this<00:06:19.970> might<00:06:20.030> last

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
but even so I think this might last

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.450 
but even so I think this might last
longer<00:06:20.600> than<00:06:20.900> del<00:06:21.560> Rhin<00:06:21.770> which<00:06:21.950> i've<00:06:22.160> seen

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
longer than del Rhin which i've seen

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.590 
longer than del Rhin which i've seen
some<00:06:22.640> people<00:06:22.940> crack<00:06:23.210> their<00:06:23.600> tank<00:06:24.230> delrin<00:06:24.650> bits
