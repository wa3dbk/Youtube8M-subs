setup<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.969> how<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.750> using<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.079> properly

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
setup is and how to be using it properly

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.940 
setup is and how to be using it properly
so<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.969> opinion<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.420> SMR<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.649> good<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
so in my opinion the SMR is very good in

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060 
so in my opinion the SMR is very good in
core<00:00:38.790> modes<00:00:39.059> yes<00:00:39.360> cormos<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:40.140> hardcore<00:00:40.500> now

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
core modes yes cormos not hardcore now

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
core modes yes cormos not hardcore now
the<00:00:41.190> reason<00:00:41.370> being<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.879> single<00:00:42.210> fire<00:00:42.390> weapons

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the reason being is single fire weapons

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
the reason being is single fire weapons
in<00:00:42.930> hardcore<00:00:43.379> mode<00:00:43.440> puts<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> great

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
in hardcore mode puts you at a great

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
in hardcore mode puts you at a great
disadvantage<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.809> miss<00:00:46.140> one

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
disadvantage because if you do miss one

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.869 
disadvantage because if you do miss one
bullet<00:00:46.800> you're<00:00:46.980> practically<00:00:47.430> screwed

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
bullet you're practically screwed

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
bullet you're practically screwed
because<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.270> only<00:00:48.390> takes<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.690> shot<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.260> kill

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
because it only takes one shot to kill

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
because it only takes one shot to kill
somebody<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.550> somebody<00:00:50.910> has<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> fully

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
somebody so if somebody has a fully

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.290 
somebody so if somebody has a fully
automatic<00:00:52.230> assault<00:00:52.620> rifle<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.219> an<00:00:53.489> SMG<00:00:53.850> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
automatic assault rifle or an SMG you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
automatic assault rifle or an SMG you
are<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> die<00:00:54.809> nearly<00:00:55.289> instantly<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
are going to die nearly instantly if you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.479 
are going to die nearly instantly if you
do<00:00:56.789> miss<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.390> shot<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> sm<00:00:59.370> are

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
do miss your first shot so the sm are

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
to get out gun if somebody has an SMG

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.550 
to get out gun if somebody has an SMG
just<00:02:40.400> because<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.359> gun<00:02:41.659> rate<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.290> fire<00:02:42.409> is

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
just because this gun rate of fire is

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.830 
just because this gun rate of fire is
quite<00:02:43.069> slow<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.579> an<00:02:43.670> SMG<00:02:43.969> of<00:02:44.180> course<00:02:44.359> is<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.569> lot

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
quite slow in an SMG of course is a lot

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.179 
quite slow in an SMG of course is a lot
faster<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.530> they'll<00:02:45.709> be<00:02:45.829> able<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> put<00:02:46.159> you

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
faster so they'll be able to put you

actually deals a lot more damage than

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.699 
actually deals a lot more damage than
the<00:03:17.180> other<00:03:17.329> single<00:03:17.720> fire<00:03:17.959> assault<00:03:18.379> rifle

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
the other single fire assault rifle

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.490 
the other single fire assault rifle
which<00:03:18.919> is<00:03:19.129> of<00:03:19.310> course<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.639> FAL<00:03:20.060> osw<00:03:20.440> now<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
which is of course the FAL osw now the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.979 
which is of course the FAL osw now the
FAL<00:03:22.069> recently<00:03:22.699> got<00:03:22.909> a<00:03:23.090> nerf<00:03:23.359> which<00:03:23.599> makes<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.900> a

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
FAL recently got a nerf which makes it a

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.319 
FAL recently got a nerf which makes it a
lot<00:03:24.169> weaker<00:03:24.409> and<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.859> ASMR<00:03:25.729> actually<00:03:26.150> has<00:03:26.299> a

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
lot weaker and the ASMR actually has a

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.679 
lot weaker and the ASMR actually has a
damaged<00:03:26.690> profile<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.290> 59<00:03:27.799> 249<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.090> that's<00:03:29.239> 59

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
damaged profile of 59 249 so that's 59

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.719 
damaged profile of 59 249 so that's 59
at<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> distance<00:03:30.229> and<00:03:30.349> 49<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.189> close<00:03:31.489> which

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
at a distance and 49 up close which

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.039 
at a distance and 49 up close which
means<00:03:31.909> it's<00:03:32.090> only<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.419> take<00:03:32.479> you<00:03:32.750> two<00:03:33.019> to

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
means it's only going to take you two to

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.219 
means it's only going to take you two to
three<00:03:33.680> shots<00:03:33.949> to<00:03:34.129> kill<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.120> SMR<00:03:35.959> does

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
three shots to kill now the SMR does

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.379 
three shots to kill now the SMR does
have<00:03:36.530> quite<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.220> small<00:03:37.459> clip<00:03:37.939> in<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.150> which<00:03:38.269> was

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
have quite a small clip in it which was

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.569 
have quite a small clip in it which was
only<00:03:38.689> 20<00:03:39.019> bullets<00:03:39.229> to<00:03:39.379> start<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.189> like<00:03:40.400> i<00:03:40.549> said

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
only 20 bullets to start but like i said

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.249 
only 20 bullets to start but like i said
it's<00:03:40.970> two<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.239> three<00:03:41.389> shots<00:03:41.629> to<00:03:41.720> kill<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.109> that

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:42.259 
it's two to three shots to kill so that

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.349 
it's two to three shots to kill so that
should<00:03:42.590> last<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:43.069> most<00:03:43.669> games<00:03:43.849> because<00:03:44.269> you

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
should last you most games because you

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.390 
should last you most games because you
do<00:03:44.540> have<00:03:44.569> three<00:03:45.109> magazines<00:03:45.379> which<00:03:46.159> will<00:03:46.280> give

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
do have three magazines which will give

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.369 
do have three magazines which will give
you<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.579> total<00:03:46.819> of<00:03:47.030> sixty<00:03:47.479> bullets<00:03:47.870> which

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
you a total of sixty bullets which

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.319 
you a total of sixty bullets which
should<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.829> enough<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.310> take<00:03:49.669> on<00:03:49.879> multiple

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
should be enough to take on multiple

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.960 
should be enough to take on multiple
enemies<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.139> make<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.159> survive<00:03:52.459> for<00:03:52.729> a<00:03:52.759> long
