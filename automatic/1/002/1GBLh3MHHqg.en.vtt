 Venezuelan who continues to produce food 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.100
 despite the serious problems of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.100
 supply and supply in the country 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.320
 yesterday its workers about 2000 that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.980
 let's have these people to the government we are 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 how many items does Polar have in the 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 market most of us 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.920
 we consume the Venezuelans this is wrong 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.720
 brother because if the only property is 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 branch that has polar food here 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.990
 capital caracas 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.299
 the government and those who follow him 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.539
 justify the expropriation of a space 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.310
 popular for an urban project that 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.380

 We are working to continue 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.640
 consolidating the homeland we want this 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.440

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.540
 of the governor of that state of bolivar 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.549
 says that everything is under control but 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.470
 call people to calm down 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.420
 calm that does not get peace about everything 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.420
