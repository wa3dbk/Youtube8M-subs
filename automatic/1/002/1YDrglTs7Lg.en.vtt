00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
be covered in makeup because that would

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.410 
be covered in makeup because that would
be<00:04:10.440> like<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:11.330> swollen<00:04:12.330> area<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.910> later<00:04:14.910> of

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:45.180 
so it looks like that so far let me just
improve<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:37.340> circle<00:04:38.340> first

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.430 

like<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.680> then<00:04:47.680> leave<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.340> dry<00:04:48.460> for<00:04:48.850> about

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
like so then leave that to dry for about

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.310 
like so then leave that to dry for about
it's<00:04:50.440> about<00:04:50.500> five<00:04:50.890> minutes<00:04:51.280> or<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.320> depends

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
it's about five minutes or so depends

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.050 
it's about five minutes or so depends
how<00:04:53.440> how<00:04:53.830> thick<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.190> cotton<00:04:54.490> wall<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:54.910> it

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
how how thick the cotton wall is to it

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.640 
how how thick the cotton wall is to it
as<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.390> how<00:04:55.510> long<00:04:55.660> it<00:04:55.840> takes<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.140> dry<00:04:56.350> but

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
as to how long it takes to dry but

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.990 
as to how long it takes to dry but
basically<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.070> minute<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.400> goes<00:04:57.580> it's<00:04:57.730> hard

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
basically the minute it goes it's hard

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.210 
basically the minute it goes it's hard
and<00:04:58.150> it's<00:04:58.270> not<00:04:58.300> sticky<00:04:58.750> it's<00:04:58.870> done<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.440> just

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
and it's not sticky it's done so just

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.310 
and it's not sticky it's done so just
gonna<00:05:00.370> leave<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.760> dry<00:05:00.910> then<00:05:01.840> all<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.110> do

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
gonna leave that to dry then all you do

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.110 
gonna leave that to dry then all you do
is<00:05:02.560> apply<00:05:02.770> some<00:05:03.220> black<00:05:03.400> eyeliner<00:05:03.610> in<00:05:04.090> the
