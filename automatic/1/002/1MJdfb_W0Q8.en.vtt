00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.440
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.420
 look at 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 since today the sewing together maria 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:26.430
 snack on the edge that is at a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.699
 pulli werbedienst the pages after and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.300
 Although I work in a way 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.300
 engraving 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.010
 I draw the thread and the 1 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:56.820
 and knot it once and then take that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.320
 second pattern last and lead is around 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.700
 these two stitches 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 the impact sick here I sting 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.830
 between the two times an un-spokesman 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.830
 also between these two play out 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:24.140
 on the other side I lead the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.140
 Needle down and services two bad 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.450
 and here I stab her in the same 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.149
 entry point one I previously 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.729
 have expelled and finally me 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.729
 between the two loop again 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.170
 and winter around these two beats 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 plug in 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.880
 here again in the same 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 entry point as previously excluded 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.190
 became a sting and like him again 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.470
 to pronounce between these two games 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.470
 these doubts speak to him 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:19.670
 again and between these 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:28.130
 two loops continue to cut out 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:31.819
 swim around stinging piercing volt 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:39.160
 stuck and worse here 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:43.330
 enclose and we address and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.330
 side of this stetten 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:54.230
 so you get between them 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:58.609
 mesh out and up and stab one 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:03.819
 both as in stitch choice 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:07.870
 Sewn together knit pieces this 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.870
 Proceed as for mesh-circuit 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.480
 and last time 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:23.500
 lose unknown under the thread 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.500
 you have such a nice card 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:33.380
 on the back again almost as 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:36.100
 Supplier people are up to you and such 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.570
 So you call the pages noticed
