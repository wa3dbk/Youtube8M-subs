00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
place with the vaulting animation so try

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.460 
place with the vaulting animation so try
to<00:01:30.680> avoid<00:01:31.420> knifing<00:01:32.420> people<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.960> are<00:01:33.049> jumping

to avoid knifing people that are jumping

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.460 
to avoid knifing people that are jumping
and<00:01:33.710> also<00:01:34.750> some<00:01:35.750> people<00:01:35.780> when<00:01:36.320> they're<00:01:36.440> on

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and also some people when they're on

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.750 
and also some people when they're on
behind<00:01:37.430> cover<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:38.210> cover<00:01:38.570> something<00:01:38.930> prone<00:01:39.830> it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
behind cover on cover something prone it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.550 
behind cover on cover something prone it
sometimes<00:01:41.479> gets<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.690> little<00:01:41.720> glitchy<00:01:42.110> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
sometimes gets a little glitchy and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.850 
sometimes gets a little glitchy and
doesn't<00:01:43.310> knife<00:01:43.430> improperly<00:01:43.940> so<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.080> brings

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
doesn't knife improperly so this brings

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.510 
doesn't knife improperly so this brings
me<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.130> an<00:01:46.369> important<00:01:46.790> topic<00:01:47.770> timing<00:01:48.770> you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
me to an important topic timing you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.789 
me to an important topic timing you
gotta<00:01:49.700> get<00:01:49.939> good<00:01:50.180> at<00:01:50.360> timing<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.409> exact

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
gotta get good at timing the exact

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.899 
gotta get good at timing the exact
moment<00:01:51.979> in<00:01:52.369> which<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.720> knife<00:01:53.900> will<00:01:54.140> best<00:01:54.909> drag

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
moment in which the knife will best drag

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.219 
moment in which the knife will best drag
on<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.240> target<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.840> comes<00:01:57.049> with

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
on the target and this comes with

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.740 
on the target and this comes with
practice<00:01:57.820> so<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:59.030> you're<00:01:59.150> following<00:01:59.299> somebody

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
practice so if you're following somebody

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.740 
practice so if you're following somebody
and<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:01.130> see<00:02:01.280> them<00:02:01.430> pause<00:02:01.670> slightly<00:02:02.390> for<00:02:02.720> a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
and you see them pause slightly for a

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.109 
and you see them pause slightly for a
second<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.950> you're<00:02:04.250> right<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.790> their<00:02:04.939> back

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
second and you're right on their back

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.130 
second and you're right on their back
that's<00:02:05.540> when<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.869> got<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.110> do<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:08.140> it's

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
that's when you got to do it and it's

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.520 
that's when you got to do it and it's
all<00:02:09.290> situational<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.310> you'll<00:02:11.200> get<00:02:12.200> better<00:02:12.320> at

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
all situational and you'll get better at

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.310 
all situational and you'll get better at
this<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:13.310> practice<00:02:13.549> I<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.900> think<00:02:15.049> that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
this with practice I like to think that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.199 
this with practice I like to think that
there<00:02:15.620> are<00:02:15.650> three<00:02:16.070> different<00:02:16.250> knife<00:02:16.640> attacks

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
there are three different knife attacks

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.390 
there are three different knife attacks
that<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.049> this<00:02:18.140> game<00:02:18.410> there's<00:02:19.070> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
that you can do in this game there's the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.509 
that you can do in this game there's the

mation what should have happened and
there's<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.750> trick<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.170> basically<00:04:43.890> you

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
there's a trick to it basically you

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.190 
there's a trick to it basically you
either<00:04:44.280> have<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.550> get<00:04:44.760> extremely<00:04:45.180> lucky<00:04:45.540> which

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
either have to get extremely lucky which

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.700 
either have to get extremely lucky which
a<00:04:46.380> lot<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.560> these<00:04:46.710> people<00:04:46.890> do<00:04:47.160> or<00:04:48.230> you<00:04:49.230> can<00:04:49.320> you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
a lot of these people do or you can you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.470 
a lot of these people do or you can you
can<00:04:49.830> sort<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:50.100> bait<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.430> people<00:04:50.760> into

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
can sort of bait the people into

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.520 
can sort of bait the people into
committing<00:04:52.380> themselves<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:53.010> your<00:04:53.970> knife<00:04:54.180> kill

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
committing themselves to your knife kill

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.530 
committing themselves to your knife kill
basically<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.770> they<00:04:56.550> see<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.390> run

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
basically if they see you and you run

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.630 
basically if they see you and you run
around<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.810> corner<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.230> then<00:04:58.950> they<00:04:59.100> follow<00:04:59.400> you

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
around a corner and then they follow you

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.780 
around a corner and then they follow you
you<00:05:00.480> can<00:05:00.660> use<00:05:01.020> their<00:05:01.290> momentum<00:05:01.640> as<00:05:02.640> a

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
you can use their momentum as a

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.960 
you can use their momentum as a
disadvantage<00:05:03.450> for<00:05:03.570> them<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:04.350> can

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
disadvantage for them you can

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.820 
disadvantage for them you can
immediately<00:05:05.970> turn<00:05:06.390> around<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.020> once<00:05:07.590> their

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
immediately turn around and once their

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.240 
immediately turn around and once their
momentum<00:05:08.100> physically<00:05:08.940> passes<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:10.130> even<00:05:11.130> if

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
momentum physically passes you even if

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.430 
momentum physically passes you even if
they're<00:05:11.370> still<00:05:11.610> in<00:05:11.700> front<00:05:11.880> of<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.440> it'll

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
they're still in front of you it'll

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.800 
they're still in front of you it'll
think<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:14.520> they're<00:05:14.850> there<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.690> you're

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
think that they're there that you're

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.210 
think that they're there that you're
behind<00:05:15.990> them<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.500> it'll<00:05:16.919> give<00:05:17.040> you<00:05:17.100> the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
behind them so it'll give you the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.580 
behind them so it'll give you the
animation<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:18.330> it's<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.110> cool<00:05:19.260> little<00:05:19.290> trick

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
animation so it's a cool little trick

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.920 
animation so it's a cool little trick
that<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:20.220> can<00:05:20.310> learn<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.850> want<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.690> thank<00:05:21.780> you
