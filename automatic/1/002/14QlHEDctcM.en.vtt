okay<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.980> we<00:00:07.980> went<00:00:08.160> over<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> few<00:00:08.760> types<00:00:09.420> of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
okay so we went over a few types of

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.810 
okay so we went over a few types of
transportation<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.830> came<00:00:11.190> up<00:00:11.400> with<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> idea

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
transportation and came up with the idea

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:24.850 
transportation and came up with the idea
of<00:00:12.620> lawn<00:00:13.620> mowers

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:58.340 

right

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.729 
been created by a car with a cadillac
converter<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.930> pollution

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
converter and this is the pollution

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.090 
converter and this is the pollution
created<00:01:05.250> by<00:01:05.820> our<00:01:06.180> solution<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.560> electric

lawn mowers if you have a small backyard
this<00:01:30.100> isn't<00:01:30.430> much<00:01:30.549> of<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.759> problem<00:01:31.000> for<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.570> but

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
this isn't much of a problem for you but

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.160 
this isn't much of a problem for you but
if<00:01:32.409> you're<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.549> said<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.270> we<00:01:34.780> on<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.990> big

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
if you're like I said and we on the big

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.350 
if you're like I said and we on the big
backyard<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.399> becomes<00:01:36.880> more<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.299> a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
backyard and it becomes more of a

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.710 
backyard and it becomes more of a
problem<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.740> decided<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.250> change<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.759> gas

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
problem so we decided to change a gas
