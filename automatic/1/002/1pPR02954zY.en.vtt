00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.160 
which tutorial it was that I explained
how<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.960> do<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:32.300> fold<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.050> those

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
how to do a fold like one of those

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.840 
how to do a fold like one of those
awareness<00:02:34.890> ribbons<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
awareness ribbons I think it was the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.520 
awareness ribbons I think it was the
inside<00:02:36.240> elbow<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:37.020> real<00:02:37.140> sure<00:02:37.170> though

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
inside elbow I'm not real sure though

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
inside elbow I'm not real sure though
but<00:02:38.220> anyways<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:38.670> what<00:02:38.820> we're<00:02:38.910> going<00:02:39.030> to

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
but anyways that's what we're going to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.100 
but anyways that's what we're going to
be<00:02:39.210> doing<00:02:39.330> with<00:02:39.540> each<00:02:40.700> piece<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.850> ribbon<00:02:42.110> we're

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
be doing with each piece of ribbon we're

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
be doing with each piece of ribbon we're
gonna<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.350> folding<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:46.850> you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
gonna be folding it just like this you

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.140 
gonna be folding it just like this you
see<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.240> see<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.290> were<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> fold<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.830> like

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
see it see if you were to fold it like

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.880 
see it see if you were to fold it like
that<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.630> would<00:02:51.750> look<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.860> of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
that it would look just like one of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.540 
that it would look just like one of
those<00:02:53.750> awareness<00:02:54.750> type<00:02:55.020> ribbons<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:56.370> we're

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
those awareness type ribbons but we're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.010 
those awareness type ribbons but we're
just<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.180> doing<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.690> here<00:02:57.930> at

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
just going to be doing it right here at

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.200 
just going to be doing it right here at
the<00:02:58.170> edge<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:59.390> you'll<00:03:00.390> want<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.630> glue<00:03:02.210> you

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
the edge and you'll want to glue you

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.010 
the edge and you'll want to glue you
want<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.420> make<00:03:03.510> sure<00:03:03.540> ribbons<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.650> lined<00:03:04.920> up

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
want to make sure ribbons are lined up

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.200 
want to make sure ribbons are lined up
see<00:03:07.020> how<00:03:07.710> my<00:03:07.860> ribbons<00:03:08.190> lined<00:03:08.430> up<00:03:08.610> right<00:03:08.820> there

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
see how my ribbons lined up right there

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.190 
see how my ribbons lined up right there
so<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:09.660> glue<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:11.220> ribbon<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:13.050> this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
so just glue that ribbon on to this

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.100 
so just glue that ribbon on to this
ribbon<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.270> want<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> do<00:03:15.630> all<00:03:15.810> three

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
ribbon and you want to do all three

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.780 
ribbon and you want to do all three
pieces<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:17.510> look<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.900> three<00:03:19.790> parts

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
pieces like this look at all three parts

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.700 
pieces like this look at all three parts
of<00:03:21.000> our<00:03:21.150> body<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:22.020> we're<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
of our body and now we're just going to

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.030 
of our body and now we're just going to
layer<00:03:23.540> them<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.840> top<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.170> each<00:03:25.410> other<00:03:25.710> you're

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
layer them on top of each other you're

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.130 
layer them on top of each other you're
going<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.220> start<00:03:26.490> with<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.790> smallest<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
going to start with the smallest on the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.120 
going to start with the smallest on the
very<00:03:28.350> bottom<00:03:29.420> put<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.570> next<00:03:30.840> size<00:03:31.020> on<00:03:31.380> top<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
very bottom put the next size on top and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.580 
very bottom put the next size on top and
then<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.910> very<00:03:33.150> top<00:03:33.450> will<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.290> largest

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
then on the very top will be the largest

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
then on the very top will be the largest
and<00:03:35.070> we're<00:03:35.850> just<00:03:35.970> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.150> glue<00:03:36.390> each<00:03:36.420> piece

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and we're just going to glue each piece

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.760 
and we're just going to glue each piece
together<00:03:37.160> right<00:03:38.160> down<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.380> believe<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
together right down here and believe it

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.010 
together right down here and believe it
or<00:03:40.890> not<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.310> was<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.640> hardest<00:03:41.940> part<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
or not that was the hardest part of the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.010 
or not that was the hardest part of the
process<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:44.150> now<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.239> we've<00:03:45.450> got<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.810> body

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
process so now that we've got the body

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.020 
process so now that we've got the body
assembled<00:03:46.920> we<00:03:47.340> are<00:03:47.459> going<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.910> add<00:03:48.090> two<00:03:48.630> ears

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
assembled we are going to add two ears

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.510 
assembled we are going to add two ears
just<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:52.140> like<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.860> said<00:03:52.920> earlier

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520
