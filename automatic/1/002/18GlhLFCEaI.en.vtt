yet I'm twenty twenty three hundred
levels<00:02:21.319> off<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.269> it's

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
levels off so it's you know it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.559

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
something that I will do and I guess

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.180 
something that I will do and I guess
it's<00:02:26.750> looks<00:02:26.959> I'd<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.620> me<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.860> complete

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's looks I'd go for me to complete

it's looks I'd go for me to complete
that<00:02:28.310> only<00:02:28.459> clue<00:02:28.790> school<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.209> it's<00:02:29.300> probably

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that only clue school and it's probably

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.729 
that only clue school and it's probably
going<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.989> be<00:02:30.050> good<00:02:30.200> for<00:02:30.349> me<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.500> do<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
going to be good for me to do it

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.380
