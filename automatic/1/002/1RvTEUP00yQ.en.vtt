 hello everyone and laura quintero in the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 today's video we will need some shoes 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.660
 of fabric that they no longer use or do not think they use and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.660
 want to modify and dye for fabric salt 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.620
 and a spoon 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.480
 let's put in a pot water not yet the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.010
 we have put the glass we are going to dissolve 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.010
 and stir everything 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.290
 we put it on high heat and wait for 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.110
 that the water is going and we are stirring and 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.840
 stirring and stirring 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.579
 we take a spoonful of salt this goes 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.350
 to make the dye catch more 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.350
 already when it 's starting to boil 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.000
 we keep stirring stirring 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.030
 when to see me finally what we do 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.909
 is to introduce the shoe into the pot and what 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.830
 we left there for 45 minutes i want 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.600
 that in my case I only go to the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.930
 half that you prefer what you can 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.159
 put everything or whatever they want I'm also going to 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.979
 use an old digital toothbrush that no longer 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.770
 use what I am going to introduce in the dye and what 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.770
 I will give as splashes in the center 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.950
 ready that's all we hope it will 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 dry 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.150
 the room temperature preferably 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.580
 and I hope you liked it is very 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.830
 easy to modify your shoes or your clothes 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.080
