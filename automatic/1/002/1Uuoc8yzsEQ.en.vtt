00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
don't enforce that and that's what I

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.650 
don't enforce that and that's what I
have<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.740> problem<00:02:50.980> with<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> beef<00:02:52.630> with

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.040 
have a problem with I have a beef with
that<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.320> anyway<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.760> point<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.180> I'm<00:02:55.690> pretty

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
that so anyway the point is I'm pretty

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.810 
that so anyway the point is I'm pretty
sure<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> was<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.680> little<00:02:56.800> retard<00:02:57.280> across<00:02:57.580> the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
some video i guess the officer had his

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.480 
some video i guess the officer had his
lights<00:04:43.910> going<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.390> everything<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:45.490> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
there talking to my wife and I guess he

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.190 
there talking to my wife and I guess he
just<00:04:52.490> pulled<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:53.000> u-turn<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:53.630> took<00:04:53.780> off<00:04:53.960> right
