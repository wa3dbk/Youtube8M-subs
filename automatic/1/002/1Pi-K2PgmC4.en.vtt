well<00:02:39.880> according<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.660> design<00:02:40.960> of<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.260> you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
well according to the design of this you

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.820 
well according to the design of this you
can't<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:42.400> much<00:02:42.900> i'd<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.320> show<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.500> some

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
of the movements that i've tried in

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.130 
of the movements that i've tried in
order<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.630> figure<00:02:46.810> out<00:02:47.050> how<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.380> works<00:02:47.650> i<00:02:47.920> can

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
order to figure out how this works i can

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.680 
order to figure out how this works i can
drag<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.200> such<00:02:50.470> as<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.860> with<00:02:51.820> no<00:02:52.030> result<00:02:52.510> i

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
drag it such as this with no result i

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.340 
drag it such as this with no result i
can<00:02:52.990> drag<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.410> way<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:53.890> no<00:02:54.010> result<00:02:54.400> i<00:02:54.610> can

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
can drag this way with no result i can

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.960 
can drag this way with no result i can
drag<00:02:56.350> other<00:02:56.590> ways<00:02:56.800> with<00:02:57.040> no<00:02:57.190> result<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.790> try

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
drag other ways with no result I can try

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.090 
drag other ways with no result I can try
to<00:02:58.030> scroll<00:02:58.480> up<00:02:58.660> from<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> from<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.650> corners

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
to scroll up from the from the corners

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.030 
to scroll up from the from the corners
or<00:03:00.340> something<00:03:00.700> with<00:03:01.450> no<00:03:01.600> result<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.230> cannot

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
on these first experiences it seems like

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.650 
on these first experiences it seems like
the<00:03:54.640> functionality<00:03:55.300> is<00:03:55.480> very<00:03:55.780> very<00:03:56.050> limited

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
the functionality is very very limited

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.380 
the functionality is very very limited
also<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.900> don't<00:03:59.020> know<00:03:59.620> how<00:04:00.520> to<00:04:00.580> go<00:04:00.910> back<00:04:01.090> there

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
also I don't know how to go back there

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.530 
also I don't know how to go back there
is<00:04:01.930> no<00:04:02.080> back<00:04:02.320> button<00:04:02.680> or<00:04:02.800> anything<00:04:03.100> here<00:04:03.540> I'm

not sure where there's nothing that I

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.380 
not sure where there's nothing that I
can<00:04:08.200> do<00:04:08.380> or<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.840> seems<00:04:11.550> because<00:04:12.550> I'm<00:04:13.150> going

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
can do or so it seems because I'm going

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.440 
can do or so it seems because I'm going
to<00:04:13.450> be<00:04:13.570> honest<00:04:13.840> here<00:04:14.110> I've<00:04:14.820> succeeded<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:16.150> few

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
to be honest here I've succeeded a few

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.440 
to be honest here I've succeeded a few
times<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:17.020> bringing<00:04:17.680> up<00:04:17.830> some<00:04:18.459> some<00:04:18.820> icons<00:04:19.239> on

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
times in bringing up some some icons on

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.350 
times in bringing up some some icons on
top<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.080> I'll<00:04:20.830> just<00:04:21.070> display<00:04:21.520> what<00:04:22.240> it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
top of this I'll just display what it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.800 
top of this I'll just display what it
could<00:04:22.540> be<00:04:22.570> like<00:04:22.750> it's<00:04:23.380> similar<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.030> if<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.510> in

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
could be like it's similar to if I go in

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.740 
could be like it's similar to if I go in
to<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:27.000> camera<00:04:28.000> which<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.330> hidden<00:04:28.479> under

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
to the camera which is hidden under

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.090 
to the camera which is hidden under
applications<00:04:29.260> here

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
applications here

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.450 
applications here
then<00:04:30.910> you'll<00:04:31.030> have<00:04:31.210> some<00:04:31.450> overlay<00:04:32.350> stuff<00:04:33.190> here

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
then you'll have some overlay stuff here

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.910 
then you'll have some overlay stuff here
and<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:34.030> corners<00:04:34.530> there<00:04:35.530> are<00:04:35.620> similar

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
and the corners there are similar

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.180 
and the corners there are similar
functionalities<00:04:36.550> in<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.480> photo<00:04:37.720> application

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
functionalities in the photo application

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.870 
functionalities in the photo application
but<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.220> don't<00:04:39.610> know<00:04:40.060> how<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.510> get<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:40.930> them<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.550> I

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
but I don't know how to get to them so I

can do nothing here and ah yeah so I'm
not<00:04:49.780> sure<00:04:49.990> which<00:04:50.290> emotion<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.920> used<00:04:51.190> here<00:04:51.520> in

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
not sure which emotion I used here in

00:04:51.670 --> 00:05:00.920 
not sure which emotion I used here in
order<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.210> get<00:04:52.360> these<00:04:53.670> these<00:04:54.670> icons<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.690> group

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.420 

so<00:05:01.930> maybe<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.200> should<00:05:02.260> rewind<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.950> tape<00:05:03.190> and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
so maybe I should rewind the tape and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:12.180 
so maybe I should rewind the tape and
figure<00:05:04.060> out<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.630> motion<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.200> did<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:11.190> ok

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
figure out the motion that I did but ok

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.730 
figure out the motion that I did but ok
so<00:05:12.250> there<00:05:12.580> something<00:05:13.300> again<00:05:13.600> I'm<00:05:14.290> not<00:05:14.680> sure

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
so there something again I'm not sure

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.130 
so there something again I'm not sure
what<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.430> did<00:05:15.730> there<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.240> no<00:05:16.450> natural<00:05:16.690> motion

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
what I did there is no natural motion

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.560 
what I did there is no natural motion
for<00:05:17.860> me<00:05:17.980> there's<00:05:18.460> no<00:05:18.640> natural<00:05:18.820> movement<00:05:19.450> of

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
for me there's no natural movement of

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.730 
for me there's no natural movement of
the<00:05:19.600> screen<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:25.570> brings<00:05:25.870> up<00:05:26.110> these<00:05:26.290> icons

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
the screen that brings up these icons

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.530 
the screen that brings up these icons
and<00:05:26.920> this<00:05:27.040> functionality<00:05:27.430> so<00:05:28.420> the

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
and this functionality so the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.120 
and this functionality so the
functionality<00:05:29.080> is<00:05:29.140> that<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.350> can<00:05:29.500> go<00:05:29.620> back<00:05:29.800> as<00:05:30.010> I

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
functionality is that I can go back as I

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.580 
functionality is that I can go back as I
wish<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.580> can<00:05:30.910> share<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.480> image<00:05:31.720> i<00:05:31.960> can<00:05:32.380> delete

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
wish I can share the image i can delete

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.900 
wish I can share the image i can delete
the<00:05:32.740> image<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.160> consume<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.640> image<00:05:33.790> as

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
the image and I consume the image as

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.480 
the image and I consume the image as
well<00:05:34.090> but<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:34.810> don't<00:05:35.110> know<00:05:35.290> how<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.590> get<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.070> it

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
well but I don't know how to get to it

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.390 
well but I don't know how to get to it
the<00:05:37.210> only<00:05:37.450> thing<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:37.720> can<00:05:37.780> do<00:05:38.020> in<00:05:38.140> this<00:05:38.260> I<00:05:38.530> until

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
the only thing I can do in this I until

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.810 
the only thing I can do in this I until
I<00:05:39.430> learn<00:05:39.790> this<00:05:40.090> specific<00:05:40.780> method<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.520> should

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
I learn this specific method so I should

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.570 
I learn this specific method so I should
do<00:05:42.940> like<00:05:44.520> this<00:05:45.520> doesn't<00:05:45.730> make<00:05:45.880> sense<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:48.430> the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
do like this doesn't make sense so the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.980 
do like this doesn't make sense so the
only<00:05:48.700> thing<00:05:48.790> is<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.060> can<00:05:49.210> do<00:05:49.330> until<00:05:49.570> I<00:05:49.720> learn

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
only thing is I can do until I learn

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.230 
only thing is I can do until I learn
this<00:05:50.170> method<00:05:50.560> which<00:05:51.250> obviously<00:05:51.730> isn't<00:05:52.030> a

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
this method which obviously isn't a

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.820 
this method which obviously isn't a
natural<00:05:52.600> movement<00:05:52.990> for<00:05:53.230> me<00:05:53.350> is<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.310> go<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:56.710> how

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
natural movement for me is to go so how

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.590 
natural movement for me is to go so how
why<00:05:56.980> did<00:05:57.130> you<00:05:57.220> do<00:05:57.340> this<00:05:57.490> I<00:05:58.500> don't<00:05:59.500> know<00:06:00.600> it's

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
why did you do this I don't know it's

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.720 
why did you do this I don't know it's
not<00:06:01.810> long<00:06:02.020> pressing<00:06:02.320> it's<00:06:02.590> not<00:06:02.800> two<00:06:03.340> fingers

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
not long pressing it's not two fingers

not long pressing it's not two fingers
it's<00:06:03.970> not<00:06:05.460> it's<00:06:06.460> some<00:06:06.820> kind<00:06:07.420> of<00:06:09.660> honestly<00:06:10.660> it
