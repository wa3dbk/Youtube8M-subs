00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.960
 that pass stable here are accelerated 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.769
 commenting and as you can see in the background is the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.670
 call of duty 4 for the pc and it's not going to 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.220
 being a gameplay is going to be a tutorial of 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.710
 how to put 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.830
 certain blind I think it's called or vince 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.220
 in the pc that can go pretty well 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.890
 the truth and good let's start 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.540
 the first thing you have to have the console 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:43.030
 activated and if I'm not wrong 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.030
 it controls where is where is 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.789
 to know where it is now 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.769
 graphics I think you're worth in options 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.430
 game options and active is the console 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:02.470
 in the console it opens giving you up 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.340
 tabulator and I 'm fine here 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.080
 for the two that I am going to explain you are 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.060
 quite simple one can not be 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.970
 use on servers because by 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.810
 saying it like that is like a hack or something 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.860
 the style and well let's go into some 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 random server 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.930
 for while charging and that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.230
 I teach it is to copy or not rula 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.420
 come on we get into another 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.420
 I already study problem this same 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.899
 you open the console and I'll leave 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.079
 the description what you have to copy and 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.539
 paste for you to put it and 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.790
 well you can put on the key that 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.570
 you want 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 I know I will tell you how I have them 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.340
 because I'm doing pretty well that way 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.650
 true and good now while loading the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 map I show you look 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.590
 this is for 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 you shoot like three bullets with the desert 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.800
 eagle very fast the truth 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.720
 is that is the one that can not be used in 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.760
 many servers but good for 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.990
 have a good time with colleagues in this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.720
 fucking mother and oh shit to came the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.540
 typical problem always now what 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.760
 reopens nothing happens and good 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.760
 but the sun 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.129
 a saint in this 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.370
 and I do not know why he does not let me move the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.909
 mouse when I start connecting but 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.299
 well the other is to do two laps 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:47.730
 the people will surely like to go to 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.670
 franco or have played the court will know that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.300
 is the lobelle tapes 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.600
 give it twice to the weapon change 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.690
 this wine makes you what 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.220
 with a button I do it twice alone and 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.140
 very fast now I'll show it 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.770
 we go there yes yes I do not care 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.410
 auto so is night by 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.570
 good 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.880
 I apologize if the left a little but the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.760
 pce I'm going quite the connection goes very 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.440
 wrong to look I'm 140 and peak and good for 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.210
 those who do not know what the double tab is 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.340
 this 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.830
 you have to give it twice to change 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.530
 weapons and laws once you change and if you 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.260
 dais two returns to his initial and by 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.360
 example I have it put the bin for 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.040
 let me do it with just a button something 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.710
 so I give a button and I do it alone 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 ok let's go there 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.460
 this text is for making the submachine gun 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.850
 of the pipe that I say you also have to 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.810
 open the console and paste it and where it comes out 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.570
 well 3 that's because it's the key or 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.750
 that if you here you put for example 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.860
 bin I know 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.940
 efe 1 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.510
 or you put it there 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.709
 but wrong forgiveness of evil 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.709
 you put f1 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:22.330
 you put f1 when you press the f1 key 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.790
 will do the pin to say it like that and look how 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.130
 you leave the pipe and I have it 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.100
 put in the is because it catches me to the side 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.710
 of the w to run and that and look you have 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.540
 have to shoot three times to empty everything 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.540
 The charger are three times eye 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.950
 if you give more than once, the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.770
 gun like recharging looks look 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.780
 and maybe you get stuck or something but 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.409
 good as you have seen soar very 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.269
 fast bullets 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.039
 look at the difference, now I 'm going to 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:54.339
 shoot as fast as you can with the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.339
 mouse 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.420
 and now I will shoot with the wine 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.229
 is very good but what is wrong is 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.600
 because it's a cheto and well I have it 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.039
 to have fun with friends and 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.039
 then the second one came 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.250
 is the double tap that is this 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.349
 I have it on the mouse wheel 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.029
 when I click on the mouse wheel and 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.129
 many will ask and how do you put 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:32.390
 that key then you have to put mouse 3 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:37.450
 and it will be exposed when you click on the mouse 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.450
 look what we put in the console 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.259
 when I applied the mouse wheel 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.569
 does the double tap only which goes very 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.260
 well because if you do back you shoot 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.420
 before and do 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.250
 otherwise he would have to wait for 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.010
 do the whole process and shoot again 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.560
 and good enough for when you read 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.650
 make us coach with someone going fucking 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.430
 mother 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.139
 and then another thing that I can teach 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.740
 since it's getting pretty short 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.650
 of this is to put texts in color by 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.289
 example I have this text in color 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.880
 actions rules or the one of zas in all the 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.040
 mouth 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.830
 I put them whenever I want because the 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.410
 I have on the keys 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.620
 well now I go back and I explain how 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.620
 make 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.850
 Okay we are here and good to put 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.630
 and some text in color is like a bin 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.410
 as well 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.380
 You must put the bing bar and here where 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.230
 It puts lyrics the letter that you want 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.990
 where when you push it to be that 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.030
 key for example I have it put in 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.590
 the f 1 and in the f 2 now I'm going to do 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:58.040
 one in f 3 you put efe 3 and you put 6 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.750
 ok and now the colors come 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.140
 colors as you see on the screen the 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.780
 number one is red number two is 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.480
 green number three I'll leave it in the 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.639
 description but in front of each number 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.350
 you have to put 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:16.720
 this little symbol that I do not know what it's called 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.700
 let's put it 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.730
 you have to put this little symbol and 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.280
 example the number to see let's look 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:27.190
 a color the white we are going to put the 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.830
 white that was the u and that little memory 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.830
 I have the 7 so I put 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.240
 text test 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.670
 not forgotten the number you have to put 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.200
 the number and then the text and 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:47.639
 then close the quotes 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:51.900
 copies paste it into the console 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:57.289
 control v you give intro and now when 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:59.779
 press f3 will leave text test 

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:02.389
 well this has been all kid I hope 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:04.399
 that you liked it if I discover some 

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:07.879
 more of this type 

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:10.580
 I will do a tutorial if you like and good 

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:14.740
 I hope you liked it we'll see you in 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.740
 the next video and water acts
