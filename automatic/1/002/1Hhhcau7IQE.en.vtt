00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 a wonderful good evening to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.809
 new video yes I have just one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.309
 get help that something with that 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.870
 Tool left are not like that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.870
 works as it should 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.439
 the problem is that one 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 that seems a bit wrong 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 he understands that he still has it 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 video of me in it was not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 right as I said that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.329
 was yes then I said out like it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
 how it works properly 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.770
 I have now shown in the new video 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 I do not know if it does not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.430
 was looked at or not right 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.629
 was looked at because otherwise it would have 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.660
 definitely works on now 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 a new 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.840
 we have the pc nc open we have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.020
 a reference bike performed 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.539
 blabla we go on machine functions 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.850
 have length measurement and compensation and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.600
 secure push button blog actively 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 okay that has to be restarted once 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 be activated with that as well 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.049
 is we gonna get that length 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.430
 We are not interested anymore 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.350
 We are not interested in that now 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 That's about the tool length too 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 measured and we need that first 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.450
 not that at some point 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.530
 interesting but at the moment for the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.740
 at the beginning absolutely uninteresting 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 So we just shut it up incompetent 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 I already have mine now 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.530
 Tool left sensor brought you have 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.790
 maybe you are another 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 not bad, everything is the same 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.220
 really only a button so me 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.210
 was said what did he write about 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.299
 had pressed 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.149
 Too much a length of 31 something else and 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.509
 down from 30 and 09 honors the measure 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.149
 30.09 taken and that with him the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.280
 Z-axis goes down very fast too 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.780
 does not start up anymore 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.819
 she would slow down with me 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 drive yes because I'm not up here 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.690
 clique under presumptuous clique 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.700
 I did that before that 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.090
 but also paints quickly and then 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.760
 slowly you have but over a millimeter 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.730
 air and he also drives fast 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.290
 down and that's just the mistake 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.730
 I'll show it again now we have to 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.110
 the depressed state have so meiners 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.550
 I take my caliper 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:47.430
 just keep it up at the bottom 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:53.850
 I'm worth seeing this crazy 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.730
 is of course very smart 43.59 should 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.870
 We remember this value and now 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.740
 we also go to parameter coordinates and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.440
 now we have down here it occurs 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.820
 Calling button measure that I would have 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:18.320
 secure now put on 43 59 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.320
 Ok, now we have the button 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.620
 lowered programmed because I had 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.650
 next thing 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.570
 I have to change you a bit 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.480
 we have the workpieces surface here 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.250
 Here is our machine table say now 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.220
 times the victim burst at me now 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.230
 we take the mountain to sound 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.540
 touch keys anyway set the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.280
 now right here on the surface 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
 you should be careful that that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.410
 material is not high here but 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.980
 it is really flat if it is not 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.080
 does 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.910
 Take double sided tape once 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.330
 and on the victim plate with it sticking 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.760
 finished almost three place offers itself 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.110
 ever like to go up and then 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.040
 not that one 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.400
 That's just how we drive now 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.400
 grope 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.640
 approximately 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:27.790
 over there can also be a so 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:29.470
 I had to change now 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.180
 everything in the previous video ever 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.980
 apparently the videos will be shown 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.080
 not looked so it will 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.970
 function 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.530
 I do not understand what is wrong 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.320
 is that if not understood correctly 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.810
 becomes 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.340
 but I'll try it again and again 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.600
 then it should be too 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.010
 I work mine with me 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.070
 It works so well we have 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.320
 approach the point down here 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.850
 there we go now to zero point me 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.970
 click that right now 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:06.660
 but I hold meanwhile on the button there 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.080
 we have the buttons i click now 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.300
 he is slowly setting 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.300
 until the button is pressed 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.629
 therefore moves slowly to the exact 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.629
 position to find 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.360
 there we can do that 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.600
 Tool left sensor and take that 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.600
 whole is presumptuous now we see too 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:41.240
 Coordination 48 works there 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:45.460
 let's say 47 should be down 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.460
 driving works , the cars works like this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.460
 fast 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.360
 Now we also see a tenant 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.480
 would have to be room yes that's even 15 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.880
 mm 15 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.130
 roughly it is the second I did not 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.650
 stuck stuck therefore the lock 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.780
 little bent upwards and when pressing 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.669
 pressed first material so synonymous again 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.090
 under that would have to consider now 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.090
 just 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.550
 I do not know what to say 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:24.680
 i just do not know i hope it is 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.030
 understandable, otherwise I know too 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.770
 not what I should do I have it 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.220
 tries to explain in the 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.220
 last video 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.360
 I try the whole video now 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.550
 to upload the same as it then at 19 o'clock 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.930
 fitting uploaded is even more 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:45.530
 I can not do that earlier and more 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:49.790
 say that is now that was it 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:52.600
 can say and if that's right now 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.669
 that's up to you 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.060
 I can not come before you as 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:02.710
 You have to do the rest yourself like me 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.710
 Thank you for watching skin in
