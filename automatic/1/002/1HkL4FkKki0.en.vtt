1.7.2 and for minecraft 1.7.10 I'm
currently<00:02:34.000> showing<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.480> version<00:02:35.010> 1.7.2

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
currently showing you version 1.7.2

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.740 
currently showing you version 1.7.2
simply<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.850> camera<00:02:37.120> mod<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.510> use

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
simply because the camera mod that I use

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.070 
simply because the camera mod that I use
for<00:02:37.959> this<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:39.030> 1.7.2<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.570> according<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
between the two is in 1.7.2 when you

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.400 
between the two is in 1.7.2 when you
generate<00:02:46.030> your<00:02:46.360> world<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.750> make<00:02:47.230> no<00:02:47.380> mistake

the upper left hand corner which gives

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.930 
the upper left hand corner which gives
you<00:03:13.080> some<00:03:13.350> basic<00:03:13.680> information<00:03:13.920> like<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.670> name

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
you some basic information like the name

gives you a couple of little information

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.770 
gives you a couple of little information
but<00:03:23.340> slight<00:03:23.580> weight<00:03:23.790> makes<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.180> lot<00:03:24.330> easier<00:03:24.660> to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
but slight weight makes a lot easier to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.840 
but slight weight makes a lot easier to
see<00:03:25.019> where<00:03:25.170> you're<00:03:25.290> at<00:03:25.489> instead<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.640> pressing

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850

the f3 key we went ahead and reorganized

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.650 
the f3 key we went ahead and reorganized
the<00:03:30.810> village<00:03:31.350> spawning<00:03:31.890> generation<00:03:32.640> code<00:03:33.360> as

the village spawning generation code as

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.290 
the village spawning generation code as
well<00:03:33.920> villages<00:03:34.920> will<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.310> spawn<00:03:35.730> using

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
well villages will now spawn using

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.600 
well villages will now spawn using

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.759 
biomes specific building materials
that's<00:03:38.850> right<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.390> whenever<00:03:39.630> one<00:03:40.050> generates

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
that's right so whenever one generates

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.880 
that's right so whenever one generates
in<00:03:41.010> one<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.580> new<00:03:41.790> biomes<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.750> will<00:03:42.930> use<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
in one of the new biomes it will use the

how frequently the new biomes generate

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.400 
how frequently the new biomes generate
well<00:04:15.120> that's<00:04:15.239> about<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.480> for<00:04:15.690> me<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:15.989> now<00:04:16.109> so

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
well that's about it for me for now so

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.990 
well that's about it for me for now so
why<00:04:16.530> don't<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.680> go<00:04:16.859> ahead<00:04:16.950> kick<00:04:17.280> back<00:04:17.549> listen

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
why don't you go ahead kick back listen
