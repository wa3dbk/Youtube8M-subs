00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.230
 me

 Hmm

 ni

 rar 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.390

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.390
 ashandan 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.940
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.780
 car 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 th 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.180
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.950
 Hi there bass pro It is counted to the country of the tap 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.979
 This time motive car latest work 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.979
 I will send you a report of primal impulse 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.850
 This impulse to be released this time 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:18.130
 With a sense of fortunate grip centered on the medium position 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.170
 It can be said that it has reaction characteristics 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.990
 Become the first motive car 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.140
 The combination of Inpan spar Ow in the two words 2 groups 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.569
 rg is 2.60 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.090
 Elder g outputs 0.05 zero 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:40.220
 It sustained a pan-type Pato mix sfp 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.040
 Skid Flick Pearl Reactive Ow 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.219
 While keeping the par release 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.219
 It is connected when there is a back end reaction as slick 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:03:01.620
 The image I pitched is as it is named in Perth 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:08.300
 Notes that the skit &amp; clip was felt that sale performance hammered out over the entire surface 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:11.630
 Its intention can be seen from the cover speed characteristics and high rg 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.050
 Interesting especially Isao Yamamoto professional Ow 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:21.660
 I felt different from me, so let me introduce 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:27.400
 Yamamoto Heritage Professional has better oil catch than myth 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.430
 I also felt the best bend width by catching from the front 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.780
 Also 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:40.840
 p Action is also softer than Sigma 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.840
 I received a report that a ball with a high rg felt a rally so high 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:50.530
 It is far from being understood even if you look at the plan before planned breathing 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.569
 I use the image that the in- house primer bends 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.000
 Yamao Pro Woo 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:02.790
 I throw in the image that the direction of impulse goes up 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.420
 Of course at the me and the mountain but the difference also type 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.420
 The type of bowler that rolls in strongly 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:16.329
 More likely to have the same low impressions and at the mountain 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:21.239
 The aura like me that does not have a strong sense of rolling in the width 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.239
 It seems to have an image with a sense of flick 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:31.640
 Also this impulse is 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.640
 We can not miss that it is a unique color scheme unmatched by other manufacturers 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.190
 There is no image that color scheme disturbs the hand now 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.080
 Pick up by appearance 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:48.759
 It is also a good color you want to throw 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.759
 Please change your impression of throwing this impulse 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.300
 Atomics sfp 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:59.270
 Skit flipper Riya' are gar 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.930
 If it makes me feel a killer child with a sharp sense from skit 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.960
 Unique core 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:09.699
 Unique dentist 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.699
 Please try unique reactions unique to Monty 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.370
 Ah ah ah ah
