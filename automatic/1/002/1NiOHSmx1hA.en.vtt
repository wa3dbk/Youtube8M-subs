that<00:00:02.689> just<00:00:03.689> pull<00:00:03.959> those<00:00:04.170> shadows<00:00:04.740> around<00:00:05.040> a

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
that just pull those shadows around a

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.320 
that just pull those shadows around a
bit<00:00:05.339> like<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:06.410> and<00:00:07.410> then<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.490> light<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
bit like that and then the light on the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.959 
bit like that and then the light on the
bottom<00:00:09.840> lip<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.710> side<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.730> goes

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
bottom lip on one side and that goes

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.810 
bottom lip on one side and that goes
here<00:00:16.100> there<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
here there like that

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.150 
here there like that
and<00:00:17.970> again<00:00:18.270> that's<00:00:18.930> blending<00:00:19.560> wetting<00:00:20.010> wet

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and again that's blending wetting wet

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.830 
and again that's blending wetting wet
there<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.760> we've<00:00:20.939> kept<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.390> nice<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
there because we've kept that nice and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290 
there because we've kept that nice and
wet<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.769> light<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.160> comes<00:00:23.789> down<00:00:23.910> here

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
wet this light just comes down here

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.540 
wet this light just comes down here
basically<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.250> how

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
basically like that and you can see how

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.839 
basically like that and you can see how
the<00:00:27.330> form<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> getting<00:00:28.470> closer<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.279> closer<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the form is getting closer and closer to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.360 
the form is getting closer and closer to
the<00:00:29.939> subject<00:00:33.079> I'll<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.440> show<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.070> little

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the subject I'll just show you a little

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.430 
the subject I'll just show you a little
bit<00:00:35.489> more<00:00:35.610> blending<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.750> forms<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
bit more blending with these forms here

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
bit more blending with these forms here
I'm<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> spend<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:39.030> lot<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.270> time

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time
trying<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:40.379> accurate<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
trying to be more accurate with the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
trying to be more accurate with the
actual<00:00:41.850> portrait<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> would<00:00:43.410> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
actual portrait of it but I would like

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.139 
actual portrait of it but I would like
to<00:00:43.680> definitely<00:00:44.070> show<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> keep

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
to definitely show you how to keep

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.240 
to definitely show you how to keep
blending<00:00:45.690> these<00:00:45.870> lights<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> darks<00:00:46.920> what's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
blending these lights and darks what's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
blending these lights and darks what's
important<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.300> eye<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:49.200> example<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
important about an eye for example is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160 
important about an eye for example is
not<00:00:50.550> doing<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> eyelashes<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.989> doing

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
not doing all the eyelashes and doing

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
not doing all the eyelashes and doing
the<00:00:52.260> white<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.680> eye<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> pupil<00:00:53.820> nice

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the white of the eye and the pupil nice

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
the white of the eye and the pupil nice
little<00:00:54.449> black<00:00:54.600> dot<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> nice<00:00:55.469> sparkly

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
little black dot and then a nice sparkly

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.139 
little black dot and then a nice sparkly
highlight<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:57.030> look<00:00:57.090> very

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
highlight that would look very

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
highlight that would look very
artificial<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> be

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
artificial what you want to be

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
artificial what you want to be
concentrating<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.910> moment<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
concentrating on this moment is just the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
concentrating on this moment is just the
shapes<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.920> light<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.370> dark<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.850> we've<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
shapes of light and dark so we've got a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
shapes of light and dark so we've got a
little<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> light<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.320> comes<00:01:04.559> down<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
little bit of light that comes down this

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.920 
little bit of light that comes down this
side<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.600> far<00:01:06.900> more

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
side like that and that is far more

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
side like that and that is far more
important<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.490> first<00:01:08.880> before

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
important to get in first before

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.320 
important to get in first before
fiddling<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.350> anything<00:01:10.710> else<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
fiddling that with anything else and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.520 
fiddling that with anything else and
again<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.600> you've<00:01:12.720> done<00:01:12.930> something<00:01:12.990> like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
again when you've done something like

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
again when you've done something like
that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.950> always<00:01:14.130> push<00:01:14.520> back<00:01:14.820> because

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that you can always push back because

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
that you can always push back because
it's<00:01:15.420> nice<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> wet<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.439> glasses<00:01:16.770> glasses

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it's nice and wet with glasses glasses

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's nice and wet with glasses glasses
refract<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> light<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.810> therefore<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.350> get

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
refract the light and therefore you get

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.300 
refract the light and therefore you get
this<00:01:19.799> light<00:01:20.280> coming<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
this light coming out over there and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
this light coming out over there and
then<00:01:23.310> being<00:01:23.640> picked<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.150> again<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> cheek

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
then being picked up again on the cheek

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.950 
then being picked up again on the cheek
there<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.409> fact<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:26.070> line<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.640> broken<00:01:27.030> by<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
there in fact that line is broken by the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.340 
there in fact that line is broken by the
refraction<00:01:29.390> then<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:31.259> bit

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
refraction then just with a little bit

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
refraction then just with a little bit
of<00:01:31.470> strong<00:01:31.860> dark<00:01:32.159> red<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of strong dark red we can just put a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
of strong dark red we can just put a
little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.350> edge<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.460> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
little bit on this edge here and that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
little bit on this edge here and that
starts<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> indicate<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.409> shape<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
starts to indicate the right shape and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.030 
starts to indicate the right shape and
colors<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> light<00:01:39.329> around<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> eye<00:01:40.040> down

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
colors and light around the eye down

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.280 
colors and light around the eye down
here<00:01:41.460> we've<00:01:41.670> already<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:43.170> bit

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
here we've already got that little bit

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
here we've already got that little bit
of<00:01:43.320> blending<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> chin

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
of blending we can do just on the chin

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.679 
of blending we can do just on the chin
to<00:01:45.299> show<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.649> want<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.390> find<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> little

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to show you as I want to find a little

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.569 
to show you as I want to find a little
bit<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:51.450> I've<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.320> harsh<00:01:52.710> light

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
bit is here I've got a very harsh light

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.760 
bit is here I've got a very harsh light
and<00:01:53.820> dark<00:01:54.060> transition<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and dark transition there and in the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.580 
and dark transition there and in the
photograph<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.000> harsh<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.840> even

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
photograph it's not harsh so even

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
photograph it's not harsh so even
without<00:01:58.710> putting<00:01:59.100> any<00:01:59.340> more<00:01:59.520> paint<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.909> here

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
without putting any more paint on here

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.719 
without putting any more paint on here
just<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.600> I've<00:02:00.840> managed<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.729> rehydrate

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
just because I've managed to rehydrate

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
just because I've managed to rehydrate
it<00:02:02.939> using<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.780> spray<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> just

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it using this spray then I can just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.410 
it using this spray then I can just
soften<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> transition<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
soften that transition out like this and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.760 
soften that transition out like this and
that's<00:02:09.420> something<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.379> only<00:02:10.470> do

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
that's something that you can only do

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.260 
that's something that you can only do
with<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.129> paints

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
with these paints

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.980 
with these paints
like<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:14.880> soften<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.000> transition<00:02:16.690> here

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
like that soften this transition here

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.590 
like that soften this transition here
and<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.950> what<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.160> mean<00:02:18.400> by<00:02:18.460> sculpting<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and this is what I mean by sculpting the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.710 
and this is what I mean by sculpting the
light<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.770> dog<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.700> sculpt<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> light<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
light and dog you sculpt the light and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.320 
light and dog you sculpt the light and
art<00:02:22.960> like<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.530> going<00:02:24.280> around<00:02:24.640> working<00:02:24.970> with

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
art like this going around working with

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.260 
art like this going around working with
transitions<00:02:26.340> rather<00:02:27.340> than<00:02:27.730> adding<00:02:27.880> fresh

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
transitions rather than adding fresh

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.170 
transitions rather than adding fresh
paint<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:30.010> can<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.310> keep<00:02:30.580> adding<00:02:30.820> more

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
paint on you can just keep adding more

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.380 
paint on you can just keep adding more
and<00:02:31.360> more<00:02:32.520> blending<00:02:33.520> these<00:02:33.670> transitions

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and more blending these transitions

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.420 
and more blending these transitions
around<00:02:34.510> until<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.710> them<00:02:35.890> about<00:02:36.160> where

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
around until you get them about where

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.400 
around until you get them about where
you<00:02:36.580> want<00:02:36.820> them<00:02:36.940> be<00:02:37.120> sometimes<00:02:37.960> that<00:02:38.200> means

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
you want them be sometimes that means

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.710 
you want them be sometimes that means
moving<00:02:38.710> them<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.100> little<00:02:39.340> bit<00:02:39.490> but<00:02:40.150> gradually

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
moving them a little bit but gradually

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.320 
moving them a little bit but gradually
the<00:02:41.140> portrait<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:41.860> drop<00:02:42.130> into<00:02:42.310> place<00:02:42.640> as

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
the portrait will drop into place as

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.880 
the portrait will drop into place as
long<00:02:43.630> as<00:02:43.780> you've<00:02:43.930> started<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.620> big

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
long as you've started with big

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.940 
long as you've started with big
proportions<00:02:45.520> first<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.270> then<00:02:46.870> slowly<00:02:47.560> work

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
proportions first and then slowly work

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.720 
proportions first and then slowly work
your<00:02:47.980> way<00:02:48.370> towards<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.120> smaller<00:02:49.660> proportions

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
your way towards the smaller proportions

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.660 
your way towards the smaller proportions
just<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.850> little<00:02:52.090> touch<00:02:52.360> down<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.960> this<00:02:53.080> lip

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
just a little touch down here this lip

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.810 
just a little touch down here this lip
actually<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.730> noticed<00:02:55.300> does<00:02:55.540> go<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:56.490> here<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.730> I

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
actually I noticed does go up here and I

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.900 
actually I noticed does go up here and I
think<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.300> quite<00:02:58.690> nice<00:02:59.340> like<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
think that's quite nice like that and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.480 
think that's quite nice like that and
here<00:03:01.830> underneath<00:03:02.830> there<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.670> little<00:03:04.270> bit<00:03:04.570> of

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
here underneath there this little bit of

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.000 
here underneath there this little bit of
on<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:07.420> cheek<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.260> chin<00:03:08.290> there<00:03:08.740> does

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
on the cheek and the chin there does

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.550 
on the cheek and the chin there does
that<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.390> we<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.630> even<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.140> add<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> little

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that and we can even just add a little

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.740 
that and we can even just add a little
bit<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.920> redness<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.640> there<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.360> can<00:03:13.480> see<00:03:13.600> now

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
bit of redness in there you can see now

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.140 
bit of redness in there you can see now
it<00:03:13.870> gets<00:03:14.020> more<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.440> more<00:03:14.710> refined<00:03:14.980> as<00:03:15.640> we<00:03:16.000> go

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
it gets more and more refined as we go

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.210 
it gets more and more refined as we go
along<00:03:16.240> I've<00:03:16.780> spent<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.410> time<00:03:17.620> working<00:03:17.980> on

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
along I've spent the time working on

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.130 
along I've spent the time working on
this<00:03:18.370> area<00:03:18.820> not<00:03:19.180> bothered<00:03:19.540> with<00:03:19.630> assure<00:03:19.960> to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
this area not bothered with assure to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.230 
this area not bothered with assure to
all<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.470> but<00:03:20.920> these<00:03:21.250> are<00:03:21.580> already<00:03:22.000> in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
all that but these are already in

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.790 
all that but these are already in
proportion<00:03:22.900> they've<00:03:23.080> got<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.440> right<00:03:23.560> light

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
proportion they've got the right light

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.580 
proportion they've got the right light
and<00:03:24.040> dark<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.490> so<00:03:24.940> by<00:03:25.570> working<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.320> area

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and dark on so by working on this area

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.850 
and dark on so by working on this area
you<00:03:27.550> managed<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.880> get<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.690> effect<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.440> is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
you managed to get the effect that is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.620 
you managed to get the effect that is
the<00:03:30.040> most<00:03:30.190> important<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.940> focus<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the most important the focus of the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.450 
the most important the focus of the
picture<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.200> that's<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.740> features<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.220> you

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
picture and that's the features that you

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.670 
picture and that's the features that you
want<00:03:33.490> you<00:03:33.820> want<00:03:34.120> those<00:03:34.300> in<00:03:34.510> proportion<00:03:35.110> if

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
want you want those in proportion if

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.350 
want you want those in proportion if
you've<00:03:35.920> got<00:03:36.190> those<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.550> proportion<00:03:37.150> and

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
you've got those in proportion and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.840 
you've got those in proportion and
molded<00:03:37.780> them<00:03:37.930> around<00:03:38.170> worked<00:03:38.920> by<00:03:39.280> spraying

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
molded them around worked by spraying

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.970 
molded them around worked by spraying
the<00:03:40.060> paint<00:03:40.390> get<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.230> paint<00:03:41.440> moist<00:03:41.710> again

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the paint get the paint moist again

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.460 
the paint get the paint moist again
spray<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.170> work<00:03:44.410> with

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
spray it so that you can work with

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.650 
spray it so that you can work with
transitions<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.820> these<00:03:45.940> half<00:03:46.240> tones

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
transitions to get these half tones

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.780 
transitions to get these half tones
pushing<00:03:47.530> them<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.740> little<00:03:48.040> bit<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.340> millimeter

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
pushing them a little bit a millimeter

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.420 
pushing them a little bit a millimeter
to<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.030> left<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.420> millimeter<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.080> right

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
to the left a millimeter to the right

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.430 
to the left a millimeter to the right
gradually<00:03:51.430> getting<00:03:51.670> these<00:03:52.020> proportions<00:03:53.020> of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
gradually getting these proportions of

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.560 
gradually getting these proportions of
light<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.800> dark<00:03:53.980> closer<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.610> closer<00:03:54.850> when

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
light and dark closer and closer when
