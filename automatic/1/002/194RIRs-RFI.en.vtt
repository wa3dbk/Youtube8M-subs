00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.519
 as the last sentence regularly the ears 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.009
 control his dog to see 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.330
 whether for example inflammations or of 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.890
 duty are dirty 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.620
 It is important that you really do that 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.810
 caught regularly with his untrained 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.100
 that with the one really good and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.300
 of course, after you look at therefore a 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.380
 a little easier if the supreme and 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.750
 just accepted the weak bonus 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.400
 more often has that one time 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.930
 a bit dirty have their ears or 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.000
 stop an inflammation that's why you should 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.130
 always look awry when you go back 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.660
 Cage attracts the Swiss It has a lot 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.240
 clean 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.829
 then we said but make important 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.840
 still make ears clean is not so 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.430
 often above all, I clearly with your when 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.350
 This cheese is in protection 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.960
 always go through another damp cloth 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.239
 It is absolutely okay Europe should be 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.850
 use once every eight weeks 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.130
 it is simply preserved in it 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 natural no flora and then of course 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.360
 every three days somehow the ears office 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 some destroyed made of 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.260
 flora native and then can 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.070
 Of course no sit down to do that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.900
 also a good tip if you like that 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.550
 want to go deep but the worry has 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.800
 that finds us is the orbit 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.270
 make a clean because it is natural 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.630
 bit difficult for me when you're in 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.330
 a discourse as dirty and risks 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.690
 Of course, then I can not do anything 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.410
 say 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.030
 what's the matter in august we are watching 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.020
 Let's look at vision dogs only from 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.090
 inside looks 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.220
 Here you can hear the horn 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.660
 see if we at the vet 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.010
 of course we are still looking at it 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.840
 times with moto scope in and then also 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.550
 really to assess the eardrum 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.470
 Of course you can do that as a dog owner 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.110
 not and you can already see that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.270
 is there something red is there something 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 Dirty when you clean the order 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.390
 you want to use only a few of them 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.760
 there's a good shot once directly 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 into the ear 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.020
 then you happen that sounds nice 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.770
 always such a nice pain 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.910
 noise that you the dog once they 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.740
 shaking often does that sometimes 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.390
 not in this case would want that 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.430
 I do not shake but do too 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.010
 nothing if they have shaken 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.360
 then you normally see it 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.730
 up here then the track through the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.080
 play with raised is that cleans 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.580
 then just with one 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.470
 wet cloth or such a mat pad and 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.970
 then the ear is important as clean 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.970
 pet owner page please no longer 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.520
 Chopsticks in the hand around in the process 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.020
 here you can hurt in and with it and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.280
 Of course it can also be that one 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.620
 you actually take out 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.970
 wanted to push further down like that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.130
 so you can just ears of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.600
 a customer 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.880
 and as I said when you go home a lot 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.420
 There are both the dog and the dog 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.420
 times the tea
