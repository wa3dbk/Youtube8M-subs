 and it has been a success but I imagine in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 the dresses of years are precious for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.680

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 You can tell us about the fabrics 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.160
 designs how was the whole process good 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 It was a long design because we wanted 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 dabble but from the big 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.980
 then all the fabrics are typical of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 we send to sublimate the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.480
 prints to give a very Hindu touch 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.060
 we add accessories 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.800
 we want to believe and we are sure of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.600
 that people already tired of going to the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.820
 common beach of the normal beach then 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 we want to create a total lifestyle 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 to go to the beach that I say okay 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.520
 I leave ready to go to the beach 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.700
 Cartagena is a beautiful city all the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.990
 There is tourism all the time 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.960
 I have not gone super well we had a 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.820
