00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
infusion it's a little bit little I'm

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
infusion it's a little bit little I'm
adding<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> butter

boiling otherwise above the bottom might
separate<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:56.909> little<00:01:57.909> bit<00:01:58.000> more<00:01:58.149> butter<00:01:58.329> now

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740 

okay<00:02:02.740> I'm<00:02:02.829> using<00:02:03.009> cold<00:02:03.310> butter<00:02:03.520> because<00:02:04.450> if

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
okay I'm using cold butter because if

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.960 
okay I'm using cold butter because if
you<00:02:04.840> use<00:02:05.020> butter<00:02:05.319> which<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.950> room<00:02:06.460> temperature

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
you use butter which is room temperature

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.759 
you use butter which is room temperature
it<00:02:07.149> will<00:02:07.240> effectively<00:02:07.630> melt<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.319> your<00:02:08.530> sauce

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
it will effectively melt and your sauce

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.889 
it will effectively melt and your sauce
will<00:02:09.009> end<00:02:09.190> up<00:02:09.369> separating<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.509> turning<00:02:10.780> into

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
will end up separating and turning into

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.470 
will end up separating and turning into
a<00:02:11.349> pot<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.739> melted<00:02:12.250> butter<00:02:12.300> whereas<00:02:13.300> if<00:02:13.420> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
a pot of melted butter whereas if you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.479 
a pot of melted butter whereas if you
