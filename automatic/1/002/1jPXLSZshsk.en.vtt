with<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> hemp<00:00:11.969> force<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.450> looked<00:00:13.019> at<00:00:13.139> what<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
with the hemp force I looked at what the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
with the hemp force I looked at what the
hemp<00:00:13.590> protein<00:00:13.740> could<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.280> great<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.420> know

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
hemp protein could do great you know

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.390 
hemp protein could do great you know
great<00:00:15.570> amino<00:00:16.139> acid<00:00:16.470> profile<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
great amino acid profile at all the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099 
great amino acid profile at all the
amino<00:00:17.640> acids<00:00:18.000> covered<00:00:18.330> complete<00:00:18.690> spectrum

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
amino acids covered complete spectrum

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.929 
amino acids covered complete spectrum
and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.740> also<00:00:19.890> had<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.340> omega<00:00:20.670> fatty

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and it also had a lot of omega fatty

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.429 
and it also had a lot of omega fatty
acids<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> knew<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> liked<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> there<00:00:22.230> and

acids so I knew I liked it there and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.259 
acids so I knew I liked it there and
it's<00:00:22.949> hemp<00:00:23.160> which<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> awesome<00:00:24.150> as

it's hemp which is kind of awesome as
well<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:26.160> compounds<00:00:26.760> inside

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
well and you know two compounds inside

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.910 
well and you know two compounds inside
the<00:00:27.240> hemp<00:00:27.420> force<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.779> Destin<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.230> albumin<00:00:28.740> are

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the hemp force a Destin and albumin are

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.009 
the hemp force a Destin and albumin are
two<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> compounds<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.029> human<00:00:30.269> muscle<00:00:30.599> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
two of the compounds at human muscle so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.450 
two of the compounds at human muscle so
the<00:00:31.320> reports<00:00:31.710> were<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.160> very

pinch it's so strong and the beautiful
thing<00:01:25.020> about<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:25.860> sweet<00:01:26.520> but

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
thing about it is it's really sweet but

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
thing about it is it's really sweet but
with<00:01:27.060> none<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> effects<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> sugar<00:01:28.049> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
with none of the effects of sugar so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.100 
with none of the effects of sugar so
when<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.520> serving<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> hemp<00:01:30.869> force

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
when you have a serving of hemp force

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
when you have a serving of hemp force
protein<00:01:31.560> you're<00:01:31.890> getting<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.400> gram<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> sugar

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
protein you're getting one gram of sugar

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
protein you're getting one gram of sugar
which<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> incredible<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.979> mean<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.579> just

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
which is incredible I mean that's just

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.749 
which is incredible I mean that's just
natural<00:01:36.030> sugars<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:37.259> beautiful<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
natural sugars it's beautiful and the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.899 
natural sugars it's beautiful and the
ability<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.600> digest<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
ability to just digest it and go on and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
ability to just digest it and go on and
not<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.720> feel<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.439> you

people like I find that to be the
easiest<00:01:49.950> most<00:01:50.369> adjustable<00:01:50.909> form<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> protein

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
easiest most adjustable form of protein

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.109 
easiest most adjustable form of protein

but if you eat poppy seed bagels
you<00:02:43.370> can<00:02:43.550> test<00:02:43.820> positive<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.420> heroin<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.590> be

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you can test positive for heroin so be

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.110 
you can test positive for heroin so be
aware<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.640> that

that's<00:02:47.330> how<00:02:47.480> goofy<00:02:47.960> these<00:02:48.230> tests<00:02:48.620> are<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> trace

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that's how goofy these tests are a trace

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.880 
that's how goofy these tests are a trace
amount<00:02:49.250> will<00:02:50.090> show<00:02:50.330> up<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.840> copy<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.770> know

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
amount will show up of a copy you know

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.740 
amount will show up of a copy you know
every<00:02:52.670> batch<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:52.880> comes<00:02:53.300> across<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.720> border

time being we have to import it we

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.120 
time being we have to import it we
import<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.880> highest-quality<00:03:17.480> hemp<00:03:18.320> there's

import the highest-quality hemp there's
there's<00:03:19.550> a<00:03:19.610> big<00:03:19.910> difference<00:03:20.390> between<00:03:20.540> the

cheap hemp cheaper hemp but we made a

cheap hemp cheaper hemp but we made a

highest quality stuff it's much finer

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.520 
highest quality stuff it's much finer
much<00:03:35.060> easy<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.480> digest<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:36.170> much<00:03:36.350> higher
