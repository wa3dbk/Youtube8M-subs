00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
believe there is anything else besides

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.590 
believe there is anything else besides
that<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:33.210> help<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.960> find<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.600> slime

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that it could help you find a slime

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.920

chunks<00:01:37.259> nether<00:01:37.799> fortresses<00:01:38.700> I'm<00:01:39.030> guessing

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
chunks nether fortresses I'm guessing

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.390 
chunks nether fortresses I'm guessing
that's<00:01:40.049> where<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> build<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> portal<00:01:41.250> at

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that's where you build the portal at

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.649 
that's where you build the portal at
though<00:01:43.310> due<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> fact<00:01:44.970> since<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.509> know

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
though due to the fact since you know

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
though due to the fact since you know
you<00:01:45.720> can't<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.140> find<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> real

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you can't actually find it in the real

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.660 
you can't actually find it in the real
world<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.270> simple<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> use<00:01:52.670> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
world so it's pretty simple to use if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.780 
world so it's pretty simple to use if
you<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.119> teleport<00:01:56.240> we're<00:01:57.240> gonna<00:01:58.490> wear

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you want a teleport we're gonna wear

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.330 
you want a teleport we're gonna wear
I<00:01:59.820> forgot<00:02:00.689> how<00:02:00.930> did<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:05.159> not

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I forgot how did you do this it's not

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.410 
I forgot how did you do this it's not

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
well usually you'll be able to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.580 
well usually you'll be able to
right-click<00:02:13.950> right<00:02:14.580> now<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.170> some

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
right-click right now but for some

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.750 
right-click right now but for some
reason<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.490> letting<00:02:18.860> me<00:02:19.860> do<00:02:20.160> any<00:02:20.520> of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
reason it is not letting me do any of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.670 
reason it is not letting me do any of
that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
