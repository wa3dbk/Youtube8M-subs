00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.259
 Hi, I'm an angel today, I did this 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.700
 makeup 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.889
 apparently they will ask what is it 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.619
 What does it say to me? Well, it's a very trick 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.840
 easy and very fast so that your eyelashes 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.840
 look much longer 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.400
 without it being noticed that they bring something this was 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.970
 a request from my friend Alex Oxford of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.600
 facebook I hope you like it and good 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.920
 I leave you with the video we will start 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.460
 first remember it you have to perform 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.460
 tabs 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.570
 later I will apply a mask 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.460
 of tabs to make it a 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.770
 very very natural way 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.210
 we're just going to apply a layer 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.210
 what do you know about the root 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.629
 towards the tips 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.089
 if you see the difference of one eye with another 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 but 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.560
 it looks a lot that I bring the mask of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.830
 eyelashes or rime so I'm going to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.400
 use a brush like this 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.980
 with this one missing a tooth I'm going to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.720
 use this if you do not have one like this 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.820
 that they can get it very easy in 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.910
 either side can use a brush 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.920
 teeth there is no problem with this 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:34.320
 part that is the brush we are going to 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 remove excess to blur 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.750
 and I'm not sure if you appreciate the difference 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.750
 between one eye and another 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.130
 already the eyelashes look much longer 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.470
 from this side 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.750
 of this one 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.080
 and it really looks very natural 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 then nobody will suspect that they bring 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.830
 mascara and it looks really good 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 they must be very careful that they do not 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.150
 you ask them lashes that do not remain 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.160
 lumps precisely to give that effect 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.450
 natural because if not if it's going to be noticed 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.240
 they bring something in the eyelashes 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.920
 and good 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.330
 now I already believe in the difference between a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 eye and another I'm going to do both 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.620
 and that's how the lashes were 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.450
 they look longer 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.420
 but they look very natural 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.940
 that's it and see you in the next 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.940
 goodbye video
