when the system breaks down whether it's
running<00:02:55.340> back<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.640> forth<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.150> creating<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
running back and forth and creating a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.300 
running back and forth and creating a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
play or just having fun with it we have

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.490 
play or just having fun with it we have
tons<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.880> highlights<00:02:59.269> touchdown<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.200> whatnot

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
tons of highlights touchdown and whatnot

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500 
tons of highlights touchdown and whatnot
of<00:03:00.709> us<00:03:00.890> doing<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.329> just

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
of us doing that and I think that just

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.699 
of us doing that and I think that just
goes<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.690> show<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.959> we're<00:03:03.230> not<00:03:03.350> just<00:03:03.410> a

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
goes to show that we're not just a

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.170 
goes to show that we're not just a
system<00:03:04.040> football<00:03:04.400> team<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:04.670> I'm<00:03:04.760> not<00:03:04.910> just<00:03:05.060> a

system football team and I'm not just a

system football team and I'm not just a
system<00:03:05.540> for<00:03:05.690> today<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.459> get<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.489> few<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.880> will

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:22.870 
system for today I get a few this will
be<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:20.709> but<00:03:21.709> if<00:03:21.829> its<00:03:21.980> statistics<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:22.640> want

be right but if its statistics you want

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.490 
be right but if its statistics you want
you<00:03:23.090> need<00:03:23.239> only<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.569> look<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> accuracy

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
you need only to look at the accuracy
