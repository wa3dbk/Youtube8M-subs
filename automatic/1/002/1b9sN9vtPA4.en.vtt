00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
lap band has been present for 10 years

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.089 
lap band has been present for 10 years
or<00:00:29.910> longer<00:00:30.410> since<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> came<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> United

or longer since it came to the United

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.200 
or longer since it came to the United
States<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.239> higher<00:00:33.690> rate<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.940> lap<00:00:35.940> band

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
States is the higher rate of lap band

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.540 
States is the higher rate of lap band
failures<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.899> basically<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.010> happens<00:00:38.399> over

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
failures and basically what happens over

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
failures and basically what happens over
time<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:40.079> longer<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.680> follow<00:00:40.980> lap<00:00:41.280> band

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
time is the longer you follow lap band

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
time is the longer you follow lap band
patients<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.809> more<00:00:42.989> failures<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
patients the more and more failures that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.700 
patients the more and more failures that
we're<00:00:43.739> seeing<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.390> our<00:00:45.719> patients

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

Kali our clinic for lap band removal the
good<00:01:01.890> news<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.399> lap<00:01:02.550> band<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> fairly<00:01:03.239> easy

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
good news is the lap band is fairly easy

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
good news is the lap band is fairly easy
to<00:01:03.660> remove<00:01:04.100> usually<00:01:05.100> adds<00:01:05.280> about<00:01:05.489> 10<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> 20

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
to remove usually adds about 10 to 20

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
to remove usually adds about 10 to 20
minutes<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> mini<00:01:06.840> gastric<00:01:07.229> bypass<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
minutes to the mini gastric bypass and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
minutes to the mini gastric bypass and
usually<00:01:08.760> those<00:01:08.820> patients<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.630> be

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
usually those patients then can be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
usually those patients then can be
relieved<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> complications<00:01:10.890> associated

relieved of the complications associated
with<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> Lap<00:01:12.060> Band<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> real

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
with the Lap Band and that's a real

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.780 
with the Lap Band and that's a real
positive<00:01:13.680> compared<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> ruined<00:01:14.700> why

positive compared to the ruined why

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
positive compared to the ruined why
gastric<00:01:15.270> bypass<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> pretty

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
gastric bypass which really is pretty

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
gastric bypass which really is pretty
much<00:01:17.460> irreversible<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> hear<00:01:20.189> some

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
much irreversible and you can hear some

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
much irreversible and you can hear some
surgeons<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.720> patients<00:01:21.960> who<00:01:22.259> claim<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
surgeons in some patients who claim that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
surgeons in some patients who claim that
the<00:01:23.070> roux<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.310> why<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.580> reversible<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> good

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the roux and why is reversible a good

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
the roux and why is reversible a good
way<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> test<00:01:25.350> whether<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
way to test whether that's really the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
way to test whether that's really the
case<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:27.439> just<00:01:28.439> call<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.950> your<00:01:29.130> local

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
case is just call up your local

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and why that needs a revision and see if
