00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
I mean we know it she's a little wobbly

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.340 
I mean we know it she's a little wobbly
when<00:02:22.780> she<00:02:22.930> landed<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:24.450> yeah<00:02:25.450> all<00:02:26.230> right

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
let's try the jump again

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.760 
let's try the jump again
let's<00:02:28.120> try<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.420> more<00:02:28.450> time

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.130 

I<00:02:35.800> think<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:36.970> gonna<00:02:37.120> take<00:02:37.360> more<00:02:37.600> practice

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
I think it's gonna take more practice

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.370 
I think it's gonna take more practice
yeah<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.460> didn't<00:02:39.910> better<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.660> arms<00:02:41.110> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
yeah we didn't better on the arms the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.400 
yeah we didn't better on the arms the
first<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:42.160> think<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.200> like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
first I think so but I really like

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.080 
first I think so but I really like
laying<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.890> dogs<00:02:45.070> down<00:02:45.430> onto<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.790> table

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
laying the dogs down onto the table

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.430 
laying the dogs down onto the table
because<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:46.690> know<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:46.930> nothing<00:02:47.020> about<00:02:47.260> them

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
because you know what nothing about them

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.350 
because you know what nothing about them
balancing<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.730> can<00:02:48.850> make<00:02:48.940> them<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.180> all

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
balancing and we can make them do all

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.730 
balancing and we can make them do all
kinds<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.750> cool<00:02:49.930> things<00:02:49.960> like<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:50.500> did<00:02:50.650> with

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740
