 which has anti-inflammatory action 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.729
 there are in this we have positioned corticoids 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.729
 they have the term I'm selling estero ideos 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.129
 as analgesics are characterized by not belonging to the class of narcotics 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.410
 and act by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins are those that generate the 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.199
 pain 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.370
 sahin is in addition to the physical can present other effects 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.370
 as antipyretic

 as an analgesic 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.470
 the locally released prostaglandin are pain mediators 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.860
 and in that direct action on the nerve terminals

 us and seventh 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.560
 psuv is active other local pain mediators that prevent it 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.620
 inflammation like histamine

 the airplanes 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.639
 by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins control pain 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.749
 Sahin is effective for the control of peripheral pains 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.389
 and in general of mild or moderate intensity 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:06.299
 at high doses some inÃ©s can control the most intense pains 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.740

 the action of substances but genera in the hypothalamus stimulates the neurons 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.789
 thermo regulators, which generates fever 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.629
 this function is mediated by prostaglandins 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:27.559
 the airs by blocking prostaglandins 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:31.349

 the anti-inflammatory action of swans 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.620
 Prostaglandins are the local mediators of the mechanisms of

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.789

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.899
 like histamine or bradykinin 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:54.259
 the anes by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins control these 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:55.770
 phenomena 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.839
 good people this
