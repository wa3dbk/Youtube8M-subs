00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.040 
that there is this gold lead here that
was<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.309> close<00:00:32.489> game<00:00:32.550> coast<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.510> know

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
was a very close game coast I know

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
was a very close game coast I know
you're<00:00:34.290> thinking<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.800> well<00:00:34.950> yeah

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you're thinking about it as well yeah

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670 
you're thinking about it as well yeah
every<00:00:36.000> single<00:00:36.239> game<00:00:36.570> Coast<00:00:37.410> has<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
every single game Coast has a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.660 
every single game Coast has a
respectable<00:00:38.489> lead<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> then

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
respectable lead at some point and then

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
respectable lead at some point and then
and<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> disappears<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:43.020> until<00:00:43.440> they

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and then it disappears up until they

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
and then it disappears up until they
lose<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> game<00:00:44.100> they're<00:00:44.370> winning<00:00:44.579> uh<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.660> got

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
lose the game they're winning uh you got

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
lose the game they're winning uh you got
to<00:00:45.899> bring<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.079> back<00:00:46.230> again<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.489> true

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
to bring it back again but it's so true

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.940 
to bring it back again but it's so true
this<00:00:48.390> team<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:48.930> seems<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> struggle<00:00:49.680> with

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this team really seems to struggle with

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
this team really seems to struggle with
their<00:00:50.070> late-game<00:00:50.309> shotcalling<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> playing

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
their late-game shotcalling and playing

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
their late-game shotcalling and playing
to<00:00:51.539> their<00:00:51.660> wind<00:00:51.870> conditions<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> closing<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to their wind conditions and closing a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.580 
to their wind conditions and closing a
game<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.719> give<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.289> too

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
game out they really just give up too

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
game out they really just give up too
much<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.820> crucial<00:00:57.300> parts<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
much and these very crucial parts of the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
much and these very crucial parts of the
game<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.170> debt<00:00:58.320> timers<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.800> too<00:00:59.010> long

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
game when your debt timers are too long

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.950 
game when your debt timers are too long
it<00:00:59.640> seems<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.149> generally<00:01:00.629> being<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.840> bit

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it seems to be generally being a bit

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
it seems to be generally being a bit
over<00:01:01.140> aggressive<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.770> getting<00:01:01.980> caught<00:01:02.129> out

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
over aggressive I'm getting caught out

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
over aggressive I'm getting caught out
the<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.449> win<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:05.180> these<00:01:06.180> guys<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.780> no<00:01:06.810> I'm

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the one win that these guys have no I'm

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.510 
the one win that these guys have no I'm
actually<00:01:07.260> blinking<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.340> thought<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
actually blinking because I thought it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually blinking because I thought it
was<00:01:08.640> against<00:01:08.909> ding-dongs<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.420> not

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
was against ding-dongs but it's not

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.030 
was against ding-dongs but it's not
obviously<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> their

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
obviously that was actually one of their

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640 
obviously that was actually one of their
big<00:01:11.159> tosses<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.049> basically<00:01:13.049> yeah<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.409> coast

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

just had this horrible time of making
the<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.700> choices<00:01:18.030> until<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:18.960> end<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the good choices until the very end the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109
