00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.120 

at<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.910> end<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.270> day<00:00:12.450> Erik<00:00:13.379> Jones<00:00:13.710> has

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
at the end of the day Erik Jones has

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.519 
at the end of the day Erik Jones has
come<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> conclusion<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.840> the<00:00:16.230> flag

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
come to the conclusion that the flag

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.690 
come to the conclusion that the flag
waved<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.700> David<00:00:18.150> Scott<00:00:18.450> had<00:00:18.599> brushed<00:00:18.840> it

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
waved because David Scott had brushed it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.939 
waved because David Scott had brushed it
but<00:00:20.700> it<00:00:20.790> seems<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.300> Jones<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.590> problems

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
but it seems that Jones can see problems

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.450 
but it seems that Jones can see problems
of<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.400> theory<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> estimated<00:00:28.590> PLSS

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of this theory the estimated PLSS

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
of this theory the estimated PLSS
locations<00:00:30.029> make<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> possible<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.840> Dave's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
locations make it possible that Dave's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
locations make it possible that Dave's
elbow<00:00:31.619> could<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.920> touched<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> flag<00:00:32.550> but

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
elbow could have touched the flag but

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.390 
elbow could have touched the flag but
just<00:00:33.629> barely<00:00:34.110> if<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:36.589> it<00:00:37.589> is<00:00:37.799> quite<00:00:38.159> easy

just barely if at all it is quite easy

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.600 
just barely if at all it is quite easy
to<00:00:38.820> prove<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.449> no<00:00:39.989> physical<00:00:40.500> contact<00:00:40.710> caused
