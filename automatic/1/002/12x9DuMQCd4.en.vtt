00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:23.590
 Today we will knit such a border 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:28.449
 the number of loops must be a multiple of 6 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.449
 + 1 at the edge 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:36.769
 first we need to tie the mesh 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.980
 from the complex columns that we already 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:46.960
 learned to knit on one of the previous 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:57.439
 lessons and linking two rows of such a mesh 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:01:02.989
 Next, we collect 3 air loops for 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:05.439
 lifting and then tying 3 columns with 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.220
 one crochet under 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:20.530
 previous air loop 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:20.530
 1 row with double crochet 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:38.020
 second and third single crochet 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:47.780
 then knit pico of 4 air loops 1 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 2 3 4 and complete the connecting peak 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:04.720
 loop further again knit 3 columns with 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.720
 one nakida in the same point 1 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.470
 2 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.650
 and three and further the pattern is repeated doing 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.420
 hook hook 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.700
 then skip one air loop 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.989
 which we have at the base and 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.579
 under the next air loop we will 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.909
 knit the same item 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.909
 3 single crochet 1 posts 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.540
 2 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.230
 three then 4 air loops 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:28.609
 connecting loop and again 3 columns 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.609
 with one crochet at the same point 1 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.280
 2 and 3 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.680
 now repeat the same thing skip 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.010
 one air loop and knit it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.670
 same element under the following 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.650
 we have a loop of air 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:09.440
 the base and so it turns out 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:12.050
 very graceful and beautiful border 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.290
