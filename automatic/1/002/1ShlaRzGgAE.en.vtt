00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 if in the course of this video here behind 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.560
 should fly around or me 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.040
 something is honest then it is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.300
 just because it storms outside 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 Nonetheless, there is mine today 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.940
 favorites from the last few weeks so 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:25.320
 from the more than the march the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.990
 Spring month more we start with 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 this wonderful product which I 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.790
 am just so pushed back again 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.399
 because my complete foundations are mine 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.200
 complete make-up is way too dark 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.780
 at the moment I can not believe it 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.579
 and that was the only one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.789
 emergency solution in the moment for me 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.950
 the new native foundation of hits 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.530
 in color 130 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.039
 i have them in april last year in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.020
 I bought it in London and I did too 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.079
 fair skin and then I thought so 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 has to be there in april march real im 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.649
 april actually bought the foundation 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.489
 You would have to be so bright then 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.619
 have been 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 This is a make up which is very easy 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.320
 that also means new york so fastnight 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.210
 So I'm the order then mine 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 redness for the most part already 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 disappeared I have such an even 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.939
 picture but she is not super blanket and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.189
 the only downside is that they are 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.770
 at least on my skin 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.540
 I put it all dry 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.180
 in the face and that is sick 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.619
 so my voice can be dry yet 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 normal does not ask me I do not have any 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.640
 I've never had a dry one before 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.530
 hour never when I get that somewhere 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.630
 should find between pacers or something 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.610
 there's yes and then I will give you and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 link that is a foundation the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 I super long keeps the skin looks very much 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.220
 very nice in moderate from the is not 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 but she is not fat either 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 does not slip around 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.460
 So I like very much ascom 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 I'm glad to see you 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 to show, and indeed as if by the way 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.460
 you somehow hear noises that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.340
 the wind here is not open and 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.190
 still bang and me the doors 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.800
 You asked me so on this way 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.929
 I posted it to you on facebook 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.380
 By the way, facebook is also down below 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.390
 if you are not active there yes 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.360
 i have facebook and i post you a lot 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.459
 there and also regularly I have him 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.450
 applied more often this is the box of 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.269
 mac i got this lipstick up 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.209
 bought last year because he had and 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.709
 at the ina the fabulous and me 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.720
 somehow do not have summer at all 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.040
 So it's good for my tanned skin 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.720
 somehow not nice at all and 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.940
 I have it now in the winter months 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.590
 are much more than me again 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.489
 I love him 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.230
 that's such a nice pink but nothing 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.920
 and crass baby pink you know what I mean 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.950
 my son so a nice bear 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.530
 pink somehow and the finish is that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.600
 I watch amplified that is very much 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.870
 long lasting such a mixture 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.790
 Creamy matt I would say 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.269
 and yes he dry but not at all 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.110
 but he keeps eternity and me 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.150
 love him 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.310
 today's problem is what we have 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.390
 hope it is not a bit following and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.459
 Although I'll show you one right away 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.280
 popular of which I do not know if I am 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.450
 not him the last favorites 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.060
 I have to show again 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.519
 look it up yes I just want 45 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.769
 and repeat with the eyeshadow 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.110
 ceo from mc i delivered this 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.820
 only actually worn 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.040
 white super super easy I go 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.769
 In the morning, in part, really no buck 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.329
 sit down and with the basic color 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.890
 too but now verizon has got and 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.750
 blinded and then darker again 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.910
 teams serve young blue i believe 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.590
 No guys setup on the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.160
 flat brush on complete song 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.930
 given 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.640
 nicely faded up and then 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.049
 a little bit on the edge 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.019
 here at the outer corner of the eye with it 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.010
 first in depth and I was done 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.040
 and I wear it again today 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.920
 such a beautiful eyeshadow is such a 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.879
 a little popper raging already says that 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:12.349
 name has its light purple brown 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.690
 So it was a miracle that was so beautiful 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.329
 Then we come to a drugstore 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.859
 product and that is the camouflage 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.419
 from patrice that is in my opinion 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.260
 a new product in the new assortment 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.360
 available in the color 010 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.370
 Euro 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.320
 I like to use mine 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.270
 eyes the fit with concealer or mine 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.520
 mac concealer and I have been since 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.110
 Never come camouflage nose 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.500
 meat did not deserve this 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.300
 really know is virtually a concealer 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.330
 but again then cover again 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.479
 creamier richer and that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.270
 here by patrice this product is 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.010
 super super opaque but not so 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.960
 that you feel at the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.960
 have spread that can be drawn her so 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.360
 and that's me, why kleister at all 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.100
 It's not a mix of pretty tight 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.470
 and creamy and can be characterized as 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.270
 super well into the skin a train 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.780
 I have not had that at all yet 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.150
 feel that somehow mine is in here 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.500
 wrinkled in my few eyes wrinkles 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.610
 especially if I had 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.590
 again very fast with powder 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.780
 pass the camouflage too 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.330
 really where she is here we would have 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.070
 A buddy who did not announce himself 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.039
 had just come and a giant 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.000
 oracle 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.590
 I get it with the normal one 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.870
 concealer not filed so at least 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.270
 not with the hit me with this one 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.940
 definitely so you see, of course, stops 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.370
 Eggsports there is something big years 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.010
 recommendation from me for all those in the 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.250
 drogerie after something already ears 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.720
 Now we come to something I do not 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.490
 thought that I would like it 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.990
 I have to be honest with you because of me 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.860
 just no good experiences with 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.020
 mascara has not had it so far 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.210
 waterproof they were so I use 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.340
 only waterproof mascara because mine 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.790
 eyelashes just go completely 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.520
 below 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.690
 I've bent with the eyelash curler 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.940
 then the show only holds with water resistance 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.040
 mascara of this mascara made in 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.140
 new york the power channel fuller 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.230
 eyelash fan I had in two 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.390
 execution in my mailbox mailbox 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.790
 one would not say so to speak 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.250
 if you are completely up to date with the language 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.920
 that was sandro for you so i got that 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.620
 get sent without knowing it 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.060
 so to speak, and then I thought so horny 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.230
 not waterproof, you can do the same 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.510
 you do not need to give away 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.850
 I can try with compromises 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.920
 is off for more than that again 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.070
 You can not do that, I have to say 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.970
 I like her very much, so watch out 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.460
 I always eyelashes and that though 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.470
 enough and really enough and 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.720
 if I go for it then they stay 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.480
 not 100 percent where my eyelashes 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.300
 or not as they were born 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.930
 but they do not go completely at all 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.490
 downward 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.580
 So I do not know if you know that 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.540
 but with not waterproof mascara was 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.720
 that with me the rod really the 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.270
 were really like this and that is here 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.100
 it so the stand then bent so and 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:18.110
 if you like them and me just so cool 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.240
