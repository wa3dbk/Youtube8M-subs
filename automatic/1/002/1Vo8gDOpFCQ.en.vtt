00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.589
 the fisherman cooking corn from a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.590
 way never seen 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.920
 Hello fisher fishermen let's show 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.250
 a new way of cooking corn that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.510
 you will never miss the point of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 Sodium cooking with logics this new 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 process is from one day to the next or 12 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.019
 hours 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.480
 but there is always an easier way to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.610
 You cook without worrying. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.190
 you will get very overcooked or too much 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 less cooked does not need to be replaced either 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.750
 water is more important than you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 will save a lot of gas or firewood and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.210
 You will not have to stay all the time. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
 looking beyond is over or is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.160
 lacking water 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.890
 one part corn and one part water 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 always in the same by proportionality 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.110
 corn will be geraldo will not leave 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.840
 When it comes to risk, it will get cooked in the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 right point never take food of the day 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.720
 anterior or sour to not attract 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.040
 butcher three pints of pacu cd 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.049
 and evil 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.610
 unless you want to search the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.530
 even when returning in the afternoon from fishing to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.799
 the camp for a ranch that is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.259
 prepare for another day in this mode if 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.229
 using hydrosedetion, which is the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.320
 For example, a new senator will spend 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.860
 on average per day 7.500 kernel of maize 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 or five liters of cooked corn to give 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 right this new process the quantity 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.960
 minimum must be six liters of 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.700
 dry corn with 6 liter of water 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 if you want to know why later 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.219
 power may ask 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.060
 place the dried corn in the can 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:07.469
 with the same proportion of water 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.420
 fire until both open boil and let 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.140
 boil for another 5 minutes 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 it does not fit in one container breaks 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.460
 While 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.510
 you want as long as they all fit 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.810
 in a single styrofoam and the containers have to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.840
 be capped and one more novelty 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.830
 The fisherman is you put your head in a 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 canister 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.090
 these six liters of corn that would be 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.700
 minimum quantity now maximum has not 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.270
 amount since it is really 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.360
 proportionality of water does not 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.130
 problem, and search always knows the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.490
 Selling bowls on the fire for cooking 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.890
 all at once to open the boil 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.610
 of these six liters of corn with 6 liters 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.880
 of water 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.890
 the response went beyond the opportunities only 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.960
 and you line the styrofoam bottom with a 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.430
 piece of wood or cook pan 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.730
 lean against the sides that will not 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.070
 burn and leave it covered with 12 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.530
 hours of the day that get up early to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.720
 Go fishing is ready for you. 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.900
 use then we will show 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.800
 It's more or less there, what's going to be the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:24.510
 process of Styrofoam and it is 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:28.760
 much and is very easy and picking styrofoam 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.760
 in a field where you wish 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:41.070
 there you were the pieces of wood 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:43.320
 If you have the woods you put there. 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.100
 sharing in the pots in the hair in a 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.130
 only 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.470
 notice the pot and proportionality 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.550
 more or less equal voids are in a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.910
 covered and can earn media 1 million will 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.340
 put in the pan sicoob 2011 and admitted 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.870
 which is placed two liters of water 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.220
 it also depends on the pané, because 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.520
 always has to fit the same 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.740
 proportionality of maize with water 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.080
 can never put three liters of emídio 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.670
 and put two liters of water or four 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.459
 of water has been proportionality 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.590
 sure that the team of the 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.660
 boiled from the stand 5 minutes and served in the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.120
 fire you put all the pots of 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.069
 once to oppose it 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.110
 if only ever in a pan 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:32.199
 you put it in 2002 and puts it in 31 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.650
 also 3 put 4 but always the same 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.259
 proportionality of water to corn and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.110
 all once in the fire after all the same 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.300
 around Styrofoam cover right 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.819
 and leave for 12 hours the other day that 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.310
 get up early to go fishing 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:51.460
 You'll get the pan with fresh corn. 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.169
 even in the hour and it will even take 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.020
 the panela can already lose in the 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.380
 neighborhood because you actually use it 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.630
 The new fish handler is you. 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.970
 bother and basic cows in full of 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.650
 corn dubai do everything in defense 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.840
 football is in the agency 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.720
 you can use little amount the egg o 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.699
 secret is quality is not quantity 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.310
 so if you watch with love, hill 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.960
 fresh corn cooked corn right you go 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.099
 keep oscar dominated in the line of your 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.949
 and with much less dem - cost and 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.409
 in fact if you use cooked corn 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.570
 fresh and will never attract meat fish 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.759
 beings without counting on it that everyone 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.610
 You know if you ate rotten food you 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.500
 gives bad stage you sick and gives more 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.560
 lot of problem animals one 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.780
 different from us a yes after all the fish is 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.860
 an animal is also as a food 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.570
 that is spoiled 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.909
 if it is the food he ate in. 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.860
 water actually the organisms in the 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.210
 book that has in this fruit to recommend 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.819
 was generated in water 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.219
 now moisten the microorganisms that 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.699
 will have in it making out of the water will 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.949
 to be 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.599
 is different from what is in the water then 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.639
 fish organism will not recognize 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.460
 to make the defense and will not make you sick 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.610
 evil is is when he eats a little and 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.620
 caco cute cat there you stay there trying 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.719
 catching the fish is not accompanied 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.610
 now have a game unless the new 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.120
 videos doctor fisherman 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.120
 thank you
