00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
bit it only takes a crack or so to slip

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.549 
all right on the other end the back end
of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.730> defense<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.390> defensive<00:01:04.019> backs<00:01:04.260> I've

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of the defense of defensive backs I've

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910 
of the defense of defensive backs I've
got<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.129> believe<00:01:05.330> we<00:01:06.330> need<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.990> make<00:01:07.200> contact

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
got to believe we need to make contact

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580 
got to believe we need to make contact
with<00:01:08.189> their<00:01:08.400> receivers<00:01:09.060> early<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.049> throw<00:01:10.350> off

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
with their receivers early to throw off

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
with their receivers early to throw off
the<00:01:10.830> timing<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.939> disrupt

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the timing a little bit disrupt

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.010 
the timing a little bit disrupt
Manning's<00:01:13.680> timing<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.490> his<00:01:14.700> receivers<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Manning's timing with his receivers you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
Manning's timing with his receivers you
only<00:01:16.229> allowed<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.950> contact<00:01:17.670> within<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
only allowed one contact within that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.859 
only allowed one contact within that
five<00:01:18.479> yard<00:01:18.869> area<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.009> expect<00:01:20.580> especially

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
five yard area and I expect especially

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
five yard area and I expect especially

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Cromartie to use more physicality than

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.890 
Cromartie to use more physicality than
he<00:01:24.270> has<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.200> past<00:01:25.580> all<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.720> we're
