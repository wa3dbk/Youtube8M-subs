mid<00:00:47.120> foot<00:00:47.360> it's<00:00:47.780> very<00:00:48.170> very<00:00:48.410> natural<00:00:49.010> if<00:00:49.250> you

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
mid foot it's very very natural if you

had the shoes off and you run that way

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.369 
had the shoes off and you run that way
then<00:00:52.610> why<00:00:52.879> would<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.120> run<00:00:53.450> differently<00:00:54.110> when

you put shoes on and run on concrete and
asphalt<00:00:56.390> well<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:57.260> true<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:57.500> there's

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
asphalt well that's true and there's

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.190 
asphalt well that's true and there's
various<00:00:58.430> reasons<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:59.270> in<00:00:59.480> barefoot<00:00:59.960> running

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
various reasons that in barefoot running

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.930 
various reasons that in barefoot running
you<00:01:00.710> don't<00:01:00.920> run<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.129> your<00:01:01.370> heel<00:01:01.610> if<00:01:01.820> you

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
you don't run on your heel if you

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.819 
you don't run on your heel if you
imagine<00:01:02.120> running<00:01:02.690> along<00:01:03.020> this<00:01:03.140> concrete<00:01:03.500> path

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
imagine running along this concrete path

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.680 
imagine running along this concrete path
striking<00:01:04.489> with<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.640> heel<00:01:04.970> you'd<00:01:05.420> end<00:01:05.600> up

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
striking with the heel you'd end up

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.270 
striking with the heel you'd end up
breaking<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.259> bones<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.680> your<00:01:06.770> body<00:01:06.950> pretty

movement that shock absorbency and now

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.110 
movement that shock absorbency and now
just<00:02:17.090> take<00:02:17.329> off

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
just take off

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.729 
just take off
when<00:02:19.660> I'm<00:02:19.780> out<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:20.080> running<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.500> feels

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
when I'm out there running it feels

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.250 
when I'm out there running it feels
really<00:02:21.040> natural<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.880> run<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.360> think<00:02:22.720> about

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
really natural to just run I think about

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.370 
really natural to just run I think about
staying<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.160> my<00:02:24.280> forefoot<00:02:24.910> being<00:02:25.599> relaxed<00:02:26.260> in

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
staying on my forefoot being relaxed in

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.620 
staying on my forefoot being relaxed in
the<00:02:26.500> upper<00:02:26.770> body<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.459> slight<00:02:27.760> lean<00:02:28.000> forward

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
the upper body and a slight lean forward

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.670 
the upper body and a slight lean forward
and<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:28.930> you're<00:02:29.080> out<00:02:29.200> there<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.560> you're<00:02:29.650> just

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
and if you're out there and you're just

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.949 
and if you're out there and you're just
thinking<00:02:30.010> about<00:02:30.400> those<00:02:30.580> three<00:02:31.000> things<00:02:31.209> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
thinking about those three things the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.690 
thinking about those three things the
form<00:02:32.260> just<00:02:32.440> takes<00:02:32.770> care<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:33.040> itself<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
form just takes care of itself it

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.699 
form just takes care of itself it
becomes<00:02:33.790> very<00:02:34.209> natural<00:02:34.780> when<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.230> get<00:02:35.470> tired

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
becomes very natural when I get tired

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.890 
becomes very natural when I get tired
and<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.190> start<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.849> see<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> weaknesses<00:02:37.599> in<00:02:37.660> my

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
and I start to see the weaknesses in my

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.470 
and I start to see the weaknesses in my
form<00:02:38.260> come<00:02:38.530> out<00:02:38.709> it's<00:02:39.010> generally<00:02:39.640> leaning

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
form come out it's generally leaning

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600 
form come out it's generally leaning
back<00:02:40.720> getting<00:02:41.380> really<00:02:42.040> tight<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.519> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
back getting really tight in the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.759 
back getting really tight in the
shoulders<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.480> notice<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.260> recognize

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
shoulders if I notice that and recognize

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.100 
shoulders if I notice that and recognize
that<00:02:44.800> that's<00:02:45.069> happening<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.420> rectify<00:02:47.050> it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that that's happening I can rectify it

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.259 
that that's happening I can rectify it
by<00:02:47.319> that<00:02:47.500> slight<00:02:47.769> lean<00:02:47.920> forward<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.459> then<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
by that slight lean forward and then the

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.949 
by that slight lean forward and then the
running<00:02:49.510> takes<00:02:49.780> care<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.080> itself<00:02:51.959> an

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
running takes care of itself an

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.500 
running takes care of itself an

just think you don't have to focus on

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.589 
just think you don't have to focus on
running<00:03:21.340> technique<00:03:21.700> at<00:03:21.970> all<00:03:22.090> but<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:22.420> so

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
running technique at all but it's so

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.150 
running technique at all but it's so

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
