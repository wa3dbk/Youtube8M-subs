 computer then gentlemen hello to everyone 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.590
 today let's see how they update 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 the programs on our computer what 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.699
 simple and easy in this case me 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.990
 I put two I repeat two programs that 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.359
 suffers from inscription in a few words 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.699
 let's go with the first the first one is called 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 I assume we go with his with del 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.440
 second is called optech kicker finished 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 thank you all, I am all cool 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 I recommend thumb on joke 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.940
 then under description skies e 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 let's go to the smoke 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 I put this link precisely here 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.949
 here once on sumo sumo on the site you 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 left the link description we go 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.370
 and we look for the software sumo e 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.039
 click on download and download it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.570
 here it is rather done this 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.070
 we install and equate the sumo icon 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.450
 same thing we do with each other 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.880
 software that he recommended to do 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.400
 of the description indy click on 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.250
 download now and have it once 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 downloaded here you have the link 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.020
 okay this is peace anyway now 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 let's go see the let's say first 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 kicker software gup because why 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.689
 this software does not find everyone 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.020
 all the software in our 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.520
 computer but let's say they are the most 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 important and above all it takes almost 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 always the free ones we click two 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.450
 sometimes we wait for him to do his 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.799
 scan because then later 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.340
 will open the inter 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.850
 here they are three relevant updates 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.409
 I am black ccleaner that I in between 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 brackets still played 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.259
 07 I use brackets to buy everything 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 when I use dry black because as I say 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.520
 always don't have the software anymore 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 updated depends on what you need 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.700
 do that I owe you with black 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.299
 burn lariso burn data is 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.280
 copy cd dvd finished these three options 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.819
 and apple tree 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.650
 yet too much that is already big with e 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.720
 software to do these three operations 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.739
 so as I say always excuse the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.870
 software that fits yours 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.420
 needs 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.069
 then it's up to you to update 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.019
 superantispyware by clicking on 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.040
 darts as you are seeing it says 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:42.170
 download now then if we go down there 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.090
 beta updates are also in days 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.530
 beta as always I do not recommend less 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.420
 that the object of the geeks or stuff 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.609
 the kind usually not the beta 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.099
 I have clearly told you 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.579
 I also only drivers per day 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.970
 relevant and just now we move on to 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.349
 sumo software as you have seen is not that 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.260
 in my complete there are only these 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.420
 sea ​​programs take those yes to 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.160
 payment to the cousin some cases like 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.230
 black and that a fee is taken to 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.900
 payment but it takes especially to those 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.299
 the more we paint important that it considers for 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.940
 the computer as important as you are seeing 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.959
 the adobe air flash player etcetera 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.419

 sumo forgive me so much or if you 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.640

 sumo who fucks them 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.360
 There are two software has even more 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.880
 valid that one reviewed the first e 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.120
 driver easy the second is driver envelopes 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.750
 those recommend them from the drivers 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.340
 sumo boutade does not make any text 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.520
 second 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.870
 worth cups when denali reigns when 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.240

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.880
 trump that is zero 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.169
 ok here you can do this 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.790
 updates as they are made 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.830
 updates cyclically with the button 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.979
 right on any update in 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.690
 this case we go on adobe air and come on 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.970
 adobe bridge there are also these here are 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.760

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.070
 download update and here it is the 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.290
 council then you are seeing 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.540
 also that there is the current version vi 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.120
 also indicates the current version is le 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.590
 beta versions as well in this case the 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.210
 I repeat the beta versions I don't read in 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.970
 where you can download the software 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:15.250
 because then there are more than one league 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:19.000
 I usually use set and sergio files 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.500
 filehippo usually advice use the 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.590
 Council this that we always return 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:27.250
 on the software of the first in brackets that is 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:31.060

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.570
 I have recommended for the two software I have 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.160
 recommended to update drivers in the 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.150
 our computer driver and software in the 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.800

 I know but there are so many that I don't 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.419
 I can try them all because these 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.590
 I use things here for work too 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:28.090

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.480
 changed from life in this case is a 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.690
 comparison of 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:44.440
 opinions here is called comparison of 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.810
 opinions between users so write in
