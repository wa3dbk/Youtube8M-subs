00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:10.730
 we still need breakfast eggs cheese 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.730
 won 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:28.550
 Of course, I do not mean glass best 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.550
 I take it shut 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 then we take as a tomato here is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:01:01.280
 our chic tomatoes head red martin 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.280
 cut small 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.770
 Of course, that's just little click 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.950
 lose again 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:40.640
 Although this is a compliance 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:40.640
 Everything is so much smarter 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.070
 now I could at least meter 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:02:07.830
 creates the most meaningful part of life 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:23.070
 really pure climbed naturally that 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:25.350
 was a bit me now i have 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:35.180
 then a problem but I think injects 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:35.180
 a little bit immediately 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.060
 how do i know exactly 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.510
 I 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.879
 that are now the same length is one 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.480
 little stupid 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.480
 yes but that is somehow 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:40.000
 chives I give cases to the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:57.519
 do not cut whole while cutting the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:02.220
 sayings not so now is all dag too 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:19.199
 expensive because eggs are important because of that 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:19.199
 a glass of 144 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.970
 it tastes great 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.910
 now active a whole history is yes 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.550
 that one also wonderful as well as the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.110
 can take work and then you stop 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.200
 Breakfast or something you wanted 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:59.320
 need for an immediate only 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:08.440
 a microwave looks right again 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:09.190
 do not go out so you can 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:17.170
 look into 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:21.460
 By the way, they are yes you could 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.080
 you could lure the whole thing 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.420
 now we can close quickly 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.830
 or was more so on the 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.090
 work, take the bags 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.730
 Okay, now I have to try after several 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.580
 found out that the whole at high 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:41.920
 temperature takes about five minutes 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.550
 Of course that is really nice and hot 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.550
 oven cloth 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:52.410
 but that's a look I think 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.410
 that very 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.660
 The whole thing is easy now 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:04.400
 hinstellen that goes fast the fix 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.400
 made and tastes great
