00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.730
 no no no 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.680
 hello to all my friends from youtube like 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.180
 they are today I bring you a new video 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.180
 tutorial where are we going to be doing 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.460
 totally hidden stairs that 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.800
 they go down and go up very fast as they see that 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.050
 Here I have done the example 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.879
 just standing in them and good ones me 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.610
 have asked how to hide the lever 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.230
 so that they do not see it easy we put a 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.710
 key block for example a corner with 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.360
 a blog are we count the pictures that are 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.670
 from where the mechanism is activated and one 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.980
 here for example here are four and one of 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.930
 right and we remove it not then the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.730
 next we have four 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.920
 frames for back to the right as in 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.050
 this box to the right and there we put 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.570
 the lever in this kind of localism does not 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.430
 It works well, I do not know why but 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.340
 they can put it in another kind of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.800
 mechanism and hide its lever and good 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.350
 as bbk I have today has made the story 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.060
 as in there they are lowered and opened like 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.830
 stairs not very fast that is the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.440
 chest can keep whatever they can 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.040
 even be a secret base 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.910
 and well, it does not close 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.480
 and so it closes and well it will have sung 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.120
 with him it is very fast and it is the action that 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.110
 he does it is very fast action and good 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.300
 the tutorial will be explained right now 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.010
 good for the tutorial first they will have 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.070
 to put a lever I recommend them well 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.120
 as blocks to some air as well as 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.150
 like this and good at the lever a 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.729
 block down we're going to put a base like this 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.250
 of two we can challenges are good others 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.100
 blocks below the redstone we put to 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.710
 every repeater and this good there is this 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.140
 from the left to two tips then here 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.800
 let's put another base a torch of 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.020
 repsol red are 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.780
 and here we are going to put another torch that 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.110
 It has to be off and here we go to 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.700
 put two repeaters so good already of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.250
 there all the repeaters have us 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.500
 that put the pistons up and the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.430
 repeater good one up the repeater 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.670
 here as you see, we remove the block from the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.660
 corner and here we put redstone so 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.150
 from simple 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 and good and get the other part I'm 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.480
 the first part where they go to 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.000
 stairs for the other part we have to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 lower a block with the redstone torch 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.450
 of repsol we are going to 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.550
 doing it has been going to extend it from the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.860
 reds torch with a put square 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.040
 repsol and here we are going to download it to work 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.310
 so let's put a repeater do a 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.069
 base of 3 let's put three repeaters 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.830
 and here we are going to put the return on everything 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.900
 this all starts here so we are 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.550
 the repeated to the staff to confuse and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.500
 we put repsol as you see here water we are going to 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.989
 keep here we put a torch of 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.080
 resistol that has to be turned off let's 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.390
 put now a repeater and let's put 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.750
 pistons like that over that repeated 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.180
 something like that 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.080
 here we remove this let's put a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.000
 base of 6 well 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.180
 so let's put pistons watching for 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.909
 above 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.219
 but the pistons looking up and 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.459
 good as the pumpkin of 6 or it is not 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:41.920
 well and another this is so watching the local 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.379
 opposite of the other pistons then 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.799
 let's make a kind x or something like that 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.950
 as in here we put repsol we put here 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.260
 another block down we're going to put repsol 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.629
 let's block the signal of these and 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.389
 let's put another signal block here 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.670
 as it came and there activates the block what 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.620
 departed to the redstone and activates the other in 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.810
 estonia if all the good one stays a 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.879
 little bit how do we lock that up? 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.459
 put stairs here and it's supposed to 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.950
 It would have to work and I forgot 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.409
 something like they see no longer working just 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.169
 I forgot some little things more we will have 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.169
 that put blocks here in the repeaters 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.300
 not so for they acquire the block and the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.280
 block activates the piston this also what 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.590
 they can make a more advanced block 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.449
 all that repeaters are and good 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.580
 she would have something like that and 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.610
 we put the stairs and they would be 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.580
 something very beautiful as you see it closes 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.800
 what is totally hidden the action is 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.689
 very fast that of the pistons and how 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.030
 You see , I already finished it because 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.189
 well it was going to take a long time so 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.689
 already try it on our part and as you see 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.819
 is that there is something if we follow these 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.810
 Gentlemen let's put the lever aside and there it goes 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.400
 down and well the same here closes 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.539
 same has tried with the lever opens 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.000
 very fast here is the chest or a good one 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.090
 we can have a chest with belongings 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 valuable to a concrete base here good 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.949
 to come down we come again 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.990
 and we jump again so that it does not 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.379
 block anything from mechanism or something by the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.319
 style 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:16.180
 then we will be finishing and just 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.069
 I would cover it and use your imagination and your 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.129
 decoration I want to tell you thank you
