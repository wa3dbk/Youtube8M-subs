00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.190
 hi everyone knows and harkat 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.320
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.420
 new glitch video on gt5 online 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.699
 update 1.16 to be able to win 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.529
 unlimited money after all 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.510
 matches so to start this after 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.519
 patch you will have to start with you 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.080
 find on the internet and go 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.609
 pretending to buy a vehicle 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.930
 so here I recommend the karin 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.429
 rebels helped that they ask you the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.870
 question in which garage do you 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.880
 want him to book you well 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.770
 there you will simply have to go 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.690
 against this little toolbox 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.000
 red and you'll just have to 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.399
 move for afterwards is fine 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.950
 are used to move your 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.870
 vehicles car rockstar on patch and the 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.440
 method to move our 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.969
 vehicles 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.289
 so now and low the only 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.600
 method that we stay low for 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.100
 well moved our vehicles and 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.629
 afterwards and hand as I have you 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.039
 said you will use the cashier 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.440
 to tools to push your 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.629
 vehicle based that the door 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.550
 passenger of your vehicle either on the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.380
 little blue circle that will allow you 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.180
 to go later in the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.439
 vehicle manager so once 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.750
 that you have move the vehicle 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.520
 with broken red tools close 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.200
 little blue circle and balla you go 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.229
 can start the same manipulation 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.180
 that ben that before so your friend 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.460
 will have to open the door of your vehicle 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.229
 is well blocked there by putting itself well 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.000
 before and after and well you 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.650
 you will have to find yourself on the internet 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.080
 and this time you are actually going 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.700
 bought the karine greubel and we can 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.530
 not you bought it and ben you go 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.180
 you move away from your vehicle and you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.520
 press triangle and so your 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.500
 character will go into your 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 vehicle and as soon as he enters 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.090
 ever you will have to do very quickly 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.619
 right arrow for you to go 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.119
 in the billion home of vehicles and 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.890
 so normally you will be pretty buggy 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.360
 your friend will see you in your vehicle 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.159
 but in fact you will be in the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.909
 vehicle manager and by the 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.920
 suite is hurting you have everything 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.850
 simply having to change your vehicle 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.290
 in which you are 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.329
 and with which you made the glitch 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.590
 so me it was malden torno by the 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.320
 karine grobel you just come 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.240

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.340
 to see that your vehicles are going 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.079
 well and truly duplicate itself and therefore a 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.250
 once your vehicles are duplicated and 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.140
 well there you will only 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.190
 get into your vehicle with which 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.780
 you did the blick 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.400
 so whoever is near the circle 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.030
 blue and then tomorrow you go 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 to go inside 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.720
 on the passenger side so well and truly 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.870
 passenger side and not the driver because 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.860
 this name your vehicle will disappear and 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.410
 once you are well and truly 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.850
 go back through the passenger door and ben 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.070
 there he goes you will be able to get out of 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.020
 your garage with your vehicle and you 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.400

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.890
 just show once in the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.520
 maximum money and low once 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.040
 you have duplicate to the vehicle you 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.840
 just have to get out of your garage with 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.420
 the original vehicle through the door of the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.590
 passenger and you go directly 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.240
 tucked in and comes into your 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.740
 garage and frees your vehicle is going 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.110

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.730
 then wait for the delivery of the 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.720
