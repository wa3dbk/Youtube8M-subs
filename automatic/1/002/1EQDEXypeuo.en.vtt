00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
 all right 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.960
 hello how I'm bad in this video 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.650
 I'm going to show you how to make the point 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.690
 slipped also known as dwarf or 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.870
 as a very low point 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.090
 this is a very simple point but it has 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.200
 very useful in all the garments that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.870
 you are going to knit 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.610
 here I already have a base in round that already 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.360
 in a previous video I showed you how 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.180
 do what 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.990
 well here to close 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.960
 to close our round 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.830
 is that we are going to make the slipped point 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.540
 or dwarf only consists of putting the 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.180
 hook and take out 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.410
 that is the slipped point 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 It also helps us to move 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.820
 length of some woven garment that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.670
 I need to move forward if I do not want to start 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 my tissue as I would normally do here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.380
 with three chains going up 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.550
 the only thing I have to do for ourselves 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.710
 I need to start the round there 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.460
 advance in the tissue with a dwarf point 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:39.730
 or slipped this is just I'm going to take out and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.730
 put in and see how I'm going to move forward 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.130
 and it's called dwarf because it gets us up 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130
 Turn up the volume 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.480
 you do not notice 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.620
 and I can move here let's show 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.960
 I start my fabric 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.240
 I can do some here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.650
 some varetas 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.650
 high point 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.730
 this also helps you to make flowers 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.730
 in the flowers you can advance the tissue 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.520
 here I already have 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.270
 some suitcases and I'm going to slide to another 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.819
 part of me from my garment with the point 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.900
 slipped 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.900
 and that advanced 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.340
 since I can go back up 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.400
 and do what you pledge ask you 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.830
 remember this nothing else is the sample of 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.530
 how to make the point no we are not 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:07.080
 making any project ok 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.080
 then I do the same again 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.019
 and I'm going to move forward with the dwarf point 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.890
 that is all the grace of the dwarf point 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.060
 but it is very useful because it is used a lot in 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.060
 all the plants that we weave 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.460
 do not take the fairies 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.240
 you only put 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.010
 and you take 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.010
 here I'm going to make another climb 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.560
 this is a slippery point here or dwarf 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.290
 that's all put and take 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.920
 now let's move forward we can move forward 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.920
 here 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.480
 and you see that you do not notice your garment for being 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.780
 same 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:25.090
 and here we have advanced in the fabric with 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.090
 our dwarf or slipped point 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.830
 I hope you have served this video 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.500

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.909
 or some item to be done 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.909
 that's all we'll see each other until the next
