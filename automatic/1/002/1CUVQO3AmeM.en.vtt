really focusing on weatherproof and this
particular<00:00:37.530> speaker<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:39.090> feature<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
particular speaker the feature that I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.940 
particular speaker the feature that I
think<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> nicest<00:00:40.170> about<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
think is the nicest about this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.250 
think is the nicest about this
particular<00:00:41.579> speaker<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> has<00:00:42.960> an

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
particular speaker is that it has an

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160 
particular speaker is that it has an
output<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> means<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.989> not

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
output on it and what that means is not

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
output on it and what that means is not
an<00:00:46.320> audio<00:00:46.559> output<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:47.070> actually<00:00:47.430> an

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
an audio output that's actually an

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.010 
an audio output that's actually an
electric<00:00:48.000> output<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.870> charge

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
electric output and you can charge

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about being a durable all-weather

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
about being a durable all-weather
speaker<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.479> no<00:01:24.659> other<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> market<00:01:25.200> and

they managed to pull it off pretty well
we<00:01:28.409> also<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> speaker<00:01:29.250> sounds

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
we also think that the speaker sounds

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520 
we also think that the speaker sounds
great<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.090> has<00:01:30.270> stereo<00:01:30.960> speakers<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
great it has stereo speakers in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.100 
great it has stereo speakers in the
front<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.430> three<00:01:32.850> watts<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> power<00:01:33.659> per

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
front and with three watts of power per

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
front and with three watts of power per
channel<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> passive<00:01:35.130> subwoofer<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.820> was

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
channel with a passive subwoofer I was

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.520 
channel with a passive subwoofer I was
really<00:01:36.659> surprised<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.290> well<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
really surprised at how well it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
really surprised at how well it
performed<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> actually<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.090> speaker
