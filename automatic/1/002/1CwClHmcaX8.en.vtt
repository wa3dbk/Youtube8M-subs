00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:02.600
 Bechen course took 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.580
 when warming up a lot everyone 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.220
 the FIS wants the player-coach not at the price why 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.959
 only with heaviest 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.759
 the immense need of every okay for water detailed way i am there 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.980
 just a lot to see with examples the benches attracted lucky tourists as well as those 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 Defense of the head of FC Bayern Vances put papers fire for this week 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.810
 look what happened and on St Lucia okay maybe the voice 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.170
 For him, Jenny Bank Manager says 90 kilos defender 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:32.850
 Canada 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.000
 and that should ultimately not guarantee the success of Opel - 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.980
 in the first storm Peter Scharff and opposite April in the save them 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.430
 made sure that the wife ultimately earned the ice as the winner 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.570
 left 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.380
 in the first third a bad game of the much praised by Jamie 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.270
 Defensive man who shaped 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.190
 that's how beautiful it is so delightful 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.639
 summoning exactly two minutes before the end of the third 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:58.490
 but still that 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.480
 one to zero for the RV under strong using the gate Roland 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.030
 Schleichardt 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.630
 the second third began with a bang and a super year 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.680
 Move that before him 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.320
 the first storm the first defense on the ice Interaction Peter Scharff 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.320
 Red Bull goes for the second one 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.270
 it was an action 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 Everything was under control now probably thought among the thousand spectators in Schweinfurt 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.540
 Ice stadium but far from the point winner in the second third of RC see 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.870
 By the way, the 1 2 2 was outnumbered by a total of ten penalty minutes for Selb 6 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.890
 for the Schweinfurt and in the 37 minutes 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.200
 quite unhappy 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 the equalizer to 2 2 through Milan 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.869
 that's actually absurd 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.009
 is also in the third of tournaments that is first minute of the game in the last 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.340
 section 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 for the BVB the shooter of course 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.930
 Munich - and therefore the know-how 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.380
 for the BRC itself 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.490
 because with the 3 to 2 opened the Canadian center forward one 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.490
 Torrausch the shot putters 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.079
 as well Jan Delay has ManU 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.609
 his character defender with striker qualities will be in the 50th minute 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.150
 Hits for 4 to 2 and after the Olympics in Alba wants to 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.489
 watching the first current maybe now maybe to look against it maybe 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.489
 take a close look 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.479
 The ProB continues in quick succession 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.509
 into the gate that he seldom 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.359
 so would the honorary rescue be mentioned that the penalty bench in the last third 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.770
 We seldom had players ourselves 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.240
 they owe that 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.630
 who himself with exaggerated severity on a poor performance of 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.659
 Chief Judge Dornberg 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.929
 Do you mean that foul? 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.209
 we are looking for 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.819
 there were two minutes 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.509
 after the five to two by one and Altmann and the sex to 2 by Stefan 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.979
 Rinck for a change once again a goal of 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.969
 Marino from his photo is such a 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.199
 7 to 2 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.409
 Again "a wonderful combination in the interplay in the first storm equal 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.569
 see several times 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.949
 and Altmann plays in Puebla - under apparently as the last training 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:20.669
 would 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 looks up in Dieburg 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.459
 it's done 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.669
 was the match winner 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.109
 Thomas Hohmann is still the roof to two friends of agricultural machinery 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.499
 made the final score for yourself 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.019
 he disappeared, scoring eight goals IRC rarely three goals 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.430
 It would have thought before the start
