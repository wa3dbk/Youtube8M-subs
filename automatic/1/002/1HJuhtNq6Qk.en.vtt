 is cheese from Holland taught from 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:06:00.360
 logically, that is, it tastes 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:07.080
 After almost nothing becomes so easy 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.940
 but that is very nice so that 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.490
 is not a bad cheese because of that 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.409

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.930

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:23.880
