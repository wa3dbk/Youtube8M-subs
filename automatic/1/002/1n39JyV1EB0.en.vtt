this is gonna be answering a question we

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.950 
this is gonna be answering a question we
got<00:00:10.520> on<00:00:10.639> the<00:00:10.730> website<00:00:10.910> which<00:00:11.299> is<00:00:11.510> what<00:00:11.690> is<00:00:11.809> the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
got on the website which is what is the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.170 
got on the website which is what is the
proper<00:00:12.379> footwork<00:00:12.799> for<00:00:13.369> the<00:00:13.459> return<00:00:13.820> of<00:00:13.850> serve

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
proper footwork for the return of serve

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.090 
proper footwork for the return of serve
it's<00:00:15.110> an<00:00:15.200> interesting<00:00:15.410> question<00:00:15.709> because<00:00:16.070> a

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
it's an interesting question because a

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.890 
it's an interesting question because a
lot<00:00:16.250> of<00:00:16.280> people<00:00:16.580> think<00:00:16.820> you're<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.630> you're

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
lot of people think you're the you're

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.930 
lot of people think you're the you're
still<00:00:18.320> use<00:00:18.530> really<00:00:18.890> not<00:00:19.070> you<00:00:19.190> don't<00:00:19.340> run<00:00:19.580> to<00:00:19.610> it

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
still use really not you don't run to it

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.220 
still use really not you don't run to it
because<00:00:20.090> they<00:00:20.390> pretty<00:00:20.540> much<00:00:20.720> have<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.050> serve

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
because they pretty much have to serve

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.990 
because they pretty much have to serve
to<00:00:21.440> you<00:00:21.560> but<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:22.100> think<00:00:22.340> it's<00:00:22.460> very<00:00:22.490> important

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
to you but I think it's very important

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.790 
to you but I think it's very important
to<00:00:23.030> get<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:23.330> right<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.290> way<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.440> like<00:00:24.770> to

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
to get this right so the way I like to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800 
to get this right so the way I like to
think<00:00:25.130> about<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.610> return<00:00:26.000> of<00:00:26.180> serve<00:00:26.330> footwork

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
think about the return of serve footwork

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.890 
think about the return of serve footwork
is<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.380> use<00:00:27.860> a<00:00:27.890> phrase<00:00:28.250> called<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.670> Y<00:00:28.850> theory<00:00:29.420> so

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
is I use a phrase called the Y theory so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.720 
is I use a phrase called the Y theory so
if<00:00:30.170> I<00:00:30.320> were<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.650> return<00:00:30.830> serve<00:00:31.280> and<00:00:31.520> I'm<00:00:31.610> gonna

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
if I were to return serve and I'm gonna

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.360 
if I were to return serve and I'm gonna
let's<00:00:32.329> say<00:00:32.450> I<00:00:32.509> feel<00:00:33.050> like<00:00:33.260> based<00:00:33.860> on<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.070> power

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
let's say I feel like based on the power

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.860 
let's say I feel like based on the power
of<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.730> incoming<00:00:35.090> server<00:00:35.329> I<00:00:35.539> want<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.780> be

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
of the incoming server I want to be

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.380 
of the incoming server I want to be
about<00:00:36.079> here<00:00:36.409> when<00:00:36.559> I<00:00:36.589> serve<00:00:36.949> or<00:00:37.370> return<00:00:38.120> I

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
about here when I serve or return I

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.139 
about here when I serve or return I
don't<00:00:39.050> necessarily<00:00:39.260> start<00:00:40.039> here<00:00:40.280> I<00:00:40.429> want<00:00:41.059> to

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
don't necessarily start here I want to

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.509 
don't necessarily start here I want to
release<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.480> few<00:00:41.780> steps<00:00:42.109> so<00:00:42.769> that<00:00:42.949> as<00:00:43.129> the

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
release a few steps so that as the

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.549 
release a few steps so that as the
person<00:00:43.730> is<00:00:44.059> in<00:00:44.210> their<00:00:44.359> motion<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:44.960> can<00:00:45.440> be

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
person is in their motion I can be

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.459 
person is in their motion I can be
creeping<00:00:46.069> up<00:00:46.249> so<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.210> Y<00:00:47.420> theory<00:00:47.929> is<00:00:48.019> just<00:00:48.050> this

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
creeping up so the Y theory is just this

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.649 
creeping up so the Y theory is just this
imagine<00:00:49.039> there's<00:00:49.219> a<00:00:49.280> Y<00:00:49.519> painted<00:00:50.179> on<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.420> floor

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
imagine there's a Y painted on the floor

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.630 
imagine there's a Y painted on the floor
right<00:00:50.929> in<00:00:50.989> front<00:00:51.229> of<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:51.710> then<00:00:52.399> right

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
right in front of you and then right

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.910 
right in front of you and then right
where<00:00:52.819> you<00:00:52.909> split<00:00:53.179> step<00:00:53.510> maybe<00:00:53.989> here<00:00:54.409> that

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
where you split step maybe here that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.739 
where you split step maybe here that
would<00:00:55.100> be<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.789> split<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:56.089> can<00:00:56.389> go<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.690> way

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
would be the split you can go that way

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.459 
would be the split you can go that way
and<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.170> Y<00:00:57.319> or<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.769> way<00:00:57.979> in<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.190> Y<00:00:58.309> Carly<00:00:58.729> so

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
and the Y or that way in the Y Carly so

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.739 
and the Y or that way in the Y Carly so
notice<00:01:00.469> it's<00:01:00.649> not<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.800> T<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.639> it's<00:01:02.510> not<00:01:02.629> an

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
notice it's not a T and it's not an

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:04.539 
notice it's not a T and it's not an
arrow<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.260> want<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.649> split<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:04.430> go

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
arrow you want to split and then go

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.240 
arrow you want to split and then go
forward<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.330> cut<00:01:05.570> things<00:01:05.750> off<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.290> some

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
forward and cut things off so some

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.550 
forward and cut things off so some
people<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.690> again<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.260> range<00:01:09.470> of

people and this is again in the range of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.130

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
time out and I got to get a head start

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.710 
time out and I got to get a head start
and<00:01:48.290> say<00:01:48.530> go<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.820> course<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.270> would<00:01:50.420> get<00:01:50.570> out<00:01:50.690> of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
and say go of course I would get out of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.420 
and say go of course I would get out of
the<00:01:50.840> blocks<00:01:51.140> quicker<00:01:51.590> because<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.950> wasn't<00:01:52.310> at<00:01:52.400> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
the blocks quicker because I wasn't at a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.340 
the blocks quicker because I wasn't at a
dead<00:01:52.670> standstill<00:01:52.910> same<00:01:53.660> thing<00:01:53.840> if<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.050> was<00:01:54.170> in<00:01:54.290> a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
dead standstill same thing if I was in a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.530 
dead standstill same thing if I was in a
car<00:01:54.620> at<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.490> red<00:01:55.580> light<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.120> I<00:01:56.210> got<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> little

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
car at a red light and I got a little

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.330 
car at a red light and I got a little
junker<00:01:56.960> car<00:01:57.170> if<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.800> car<00:01:57.980> that's<00:01:58.190> not

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
junker car if the car that's not

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.860 
junker car if the car that's not
completely<00:01:58.850> still<00:01:59.180> it's<00:01:59.300> gonna<00:01:59.390> hit<00:01:59.600> be<00:01:59.750> out

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
completely still it's gonna hit be out

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.810 
completely still it's gonna hit be out
of<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.050> box<00:02:00.200> quicker<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.190> one<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.610> things

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
of the box quicker so one of the things

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.550 
of the box quicker so one of the things
you<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.090> look<00:02:02.300> for<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.870> make<00:02:03.200> sure<00:02:03.350> you're

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
you can look for to make sure you're

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.920 
you can look for to make sure you're
doing<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.980> is<00:02:04.240> your<00:02:05.240> racket<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.720> hand

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
doing that is your racket and hand

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.440 
doing that is your racket and hand
should<00:02:06.080> go<00:02:06.170> together<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:07.130> can<00:02:07.700> tell<00:02:07.909> from<00:02:08.090> very

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
should go together I can tell from very

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.149 
should go together I can tell from very
far<00:02:08.690> away<00:02:08.840> when<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.289> not<00:02:09.470> working<00:02:09.860> properly

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
far away when it's not working properly

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.190 
far away when it's not working properly
for<00:02:10.610> one<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.849> my<00:02:10.879> students<00:02:11.360> because<00:02:12.019> they'll

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
for one of my students because they'll

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.559 
for one of my students because they'll
be<00:02:12.230> planted<00:02:13.100> they're<00:02:13.490> ready<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.120> only<00:02:14.480> in

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
be planted they're ready really only in

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.930 
be planted they're ready really only in
the<00:02:14.690> upper<00:02:14.930> body<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.430> what<00:02:16.580> I'll<00:02:16.700> see

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the upper body and this is what I'll see

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.680 
the upper body and this is what I'll see
the<00:02:17.420> ball

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the ball

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.840

one is gonna have a little bit of creep
a<00:02:25.820> split<00:02:26.720> right<00:02:26.990> when<00:02:27.140> they<00:02:27.260> hit<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.650> then

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
a split right when they hit and then

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.320 
a split right when they hit and then

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
that was more compact let's do one more

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.960 
that was more compact let's do one more
than<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> got<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:57.020> tip<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.410> you<00:03:00.250> okay<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.760> I'm

than I got a tip for you okay so I'm

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.520 
than I got a tip for you okay so I'm
gonna<00:03:02.090> try<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.330> break<00:03:02.570> these<00:03:02.750> down<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.350> in

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
gonna try to break these down for you in

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.340 
gonna try to break these down for you in
two<00:03:03.770> two<00:03:04.340> ways<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.700> look<00:03:04.850> at<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.330> call<00:03:06.080> them

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
two two ways to look at it I call them

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.560 
two two ways to look at it I call them
for<00:03:06.620> lack<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.130> better<00:03:07.190> word<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:08.120> singles

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
for lack of a better word the singles

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.080 
for lack of a better word the singles
return<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.440> doubles<00:03:09.770> return<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.370> single

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
return and a doubles return a single

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.410 
return and a doubles return a single
return<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:12.320> swing<00:03:12.650> itself<00:03:13.160> still<00:03:14.060> might<00:03:14.300> be

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
return the swing itself still might be

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.510 
return the swing itself still might be
quite<00:03:14.690> big<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:15.380> lot<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.040> power<00:03:16.220> maybe

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
quite big so a lot of the power maybe

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.130 
quite big so a lot of the power maybe
80%<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.300> power<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.630> coming<00:03:17.810> from<00:03:18.020> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
80% of the power is coming from the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.410 
80% of the power is coming from the
swing<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.860> still<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.280> some<00:03:19.490> movement<00:03:19.910> but

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
swing you still have some movement but

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.900 
swing you still have some movement but
you're<00:03:20.600> not<00:03:20.750> really<00:03:21.080> totally<00:03:21.820> crashing<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
you're not really totally crashing the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.970 
you're not really totally crashing the
net<00:03:22.940> afterwards<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:23.930> still<00:03:24.170> primarily<00:03:24.650> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
net afterwards so it's still primarily a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.090 
net afterwards so it's still primarily a
swing<00:03:25.280> shot<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.760> doubles<00:03:26.510> return<00:03:26.959> is<00:03:27.230> maybe

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
swing shot a doubles return is maybe

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.800 
swing shot a doubles return is maybe
gonna<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.610> different<00:03:28.820> ratios<00:03:29.180> more<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
gonna have different ratios more the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.410 
gonna have different ratios more the
power<00:03:30.050> will<00:03:30.739> come<00:03:30.920> from<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.370> body<00:03:31.610> which

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
power will come from the body which

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.940 
power will come from the body which
means<00:03:32.630> you're<00:03:32.840> going<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:32.989> close<00:03:33.230> harder<00:03:33.680> so

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
means you're going to close harder so

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.370 
means you're going to close harder so
example<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.910> would<00:03:35.090> be<00:03:35.209> maybe<00:03:35.390> me<00:03:35.690> moving

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
example this would be maybe me moving

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.280 
example this would be maybe me moving
for<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.620> singles<00:03:37.010> return<00:03:37.480> okay<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.720> this<00:03:39.050> might

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
for a singles return okay and this might

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.050 
for a singles return okay and this might
be<00:03:39.320> moving<00:03:39.830> for<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.160> doubles<00:03:40.489> return<00:03:40.820> where<00:03:41.030> I

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
be moving for a doubles return where I

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.000 
be moving for a doubles return where I
start<00:03:41.300> creeping<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.900> I'm<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.650> I'm<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.860> lot

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.550 
start creeping and I'm in and I'm a lot
I'm<00:03:43.760> not<00:03:43.970> more<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.300> here<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> more<00:03:45.380> you

have<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.080> soften<00:03:48.320> up<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.860> see<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.580> lot<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.850> players

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
have to soften up I see a lot of players

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.120 
have to soften up I see a lot of players
try<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.390> do<00:03:50.600> this<00:03:50.750> why<00:03:50.930> theory<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.560> they<00:03:51.980> keep

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
try to do this why theory and they keep

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.550 
try to do this why theory and they keep
the<00:03:52.310> same<00:03:52.610> old<00:03:52.820> giant<00:03:53.239> swing<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:54.260> now<00:03:54.380> they're

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the same old giant swing but now they're

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.900 
the same old giant swing but now they're
a<00:03:54.590> lot<00:03:54.739> closer<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.340> ball<00:03:55.489> they<00:03:55.640> move

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
a lot closer to the ball they move

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.790 
a lot closer to the ball they move
forward<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.690> timing<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.200> tough<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.590> let<00:03:57.709> me

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
forward so the timing is tough so let me

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.620 
forward so the timing is tough so let me
see<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.430> want<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.880> see<00:03:58.940> your<00:03:59.060> really<00:03:59.420> let

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.390 

okay<00:04:10.570> good<00:04:10.810> good<00:04:11.050> good<00:04:11.110> now<00:04:11.890> let's<00:04:12.220> pretend

okay good good good now let's pretend
this<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:12.940> doubles<00:04:13.330> match<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.930> know<00:04:14.140> they're

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
this is a doubles match you know they're

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.229 
this is a doubles match you know they're
coming<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:14.860> yeah<00:04:15.670> look<00:04:15.940> at<00:04:16.060> where<00:04:16.150> you're

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
coming in yeah look at where you're

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.819 
coming in yeah look at where you're
gonna<00:04:16.299> take<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:16.870> she<00:04:16.930> starts<00:04:17.350> way<00:04:17.560> further

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
gonna take it so she starts way further

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.140 
gonna take it so she starts way further
in<00:04:18.100> there's<00:04:18.280> still<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.459> little<00:04:18.609> bit<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> why

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
in there's still a little bit of a why

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.740 
in there's still a little bit of a why
notice<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.170> compact<00:04:20.739> swing<00:04:20.980> here<00:04:21.400> boom<00:04:22.390> and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
notice the compact swing here boom and

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.100 
notice the compact swing here boom and
that's<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.620> huge<00:04:23.830> difference<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:25.110> that

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
that's a huge difference so I think that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.960 
that's a huge difference so I think that
I'd<00:04:26.320> like<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.830> everybody<00:04:27.430> have<00:04:27.730> both

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
deep pockets as a returner you should

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.040 
deep pockets as a returner you should
have<00:04:39.370> more<00:04:39.580> than<00:04:39.640> one<00:04:39.910> option<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.450> we're<00:04:40.930> not

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
have more than one option and we're not

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.570 
have more than one option and we're not
even<00:04:41.260> talking<00:04:41.380> about<00:04:41.590> all<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.980> alternative

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
even talking about all the alternative

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.160 
even talking about all the alternative
options<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.120> chip<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.930> LOB<00:04:44.140> and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
options of the chip and the LOB and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.020 
options of the chip and the LOB and
stuff<00:04:44.500> like<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:44.890> as<00:04:45.160> far<00:04:45.310> as<00:04:45.370> volley<00:04:45.730> or

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
stuff like that so as far as volley or

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.390 
stuff like that so as far as volley or
return<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:46.750> serve<00:04:46.930> footwork<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.620> think<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.250> all

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
return of serve footwork I think it all

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.520 
return of serve footwork I think it all
starts<00:04:48.700> with<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> y<00:04:49.090> theory<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:49.720> split<00:04:50.260> steps

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
starts with a y theory and split steps

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.440 
starts with a y theory and split steps
