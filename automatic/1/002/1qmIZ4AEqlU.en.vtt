00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.460
 the third match in the psv a1 poll 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.720
 the own at the top tournament went against 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.630
 FC Twente 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.519
 The team from Enschede had a point PSV 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.049
 still 0 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 de en cds took up that point 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.400
 Anderlecht and PSV 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 moreover, not scored yet had to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.680
 and so would change 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.180
 a great attack via weimans here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 that is just trying to find something 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.789
 he does n't do that in the stupid either 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.010
 not 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.510
 great educated opportunity for the tour van 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.850
 a pascal jansen 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.190
 so i start phase of the first half 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 mountain with a spiral slightly mountain my very 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 actively great possibility this the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.739
 opening goal he tries more 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 operate 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.000
 that could not have been better themselves 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 shoot but psv remains eager here 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 the ball is captured 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.719
 and weimans was hurried by with a throw-in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 do not smil nothing fine that is the duo 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 the most danger founded the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.789
 left outer pull in with right 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.710
 great rescue then full of goalkeeper drum and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.760
 that's how it is halfway through the first half 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 always 0 0 against all ratios 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.290
 and psv must actually win for the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.900
 competition to be in place 5 safely 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.369
 and the tree is a teacher there 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 justly 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.890
 Matthew's unions from Denmark are moving 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.259
 team ahead but this is great 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.900
 we boris face and something shows in between 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.560
 two men and serves those unions 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 perfect and that does not hesitate for a moment 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.860
 do not stand a chance of psv on the track 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.329
 head Start 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.490
 during a gentleman himself that on 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.880
 leads way traffic 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.439
 were on the right side over the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.960
 construction finds blonde with the cross and that 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.950
 everything should be fine but the keeper 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.670
 is in the way fine attack good again 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.219
 opportunity enforced by psv de hoekse 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.710
 rebelliously rolling with the cross and there 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.450
 is alberto at the second post and immediately 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.060
 from rest this was the perfect choice 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.140
 possibility to be google 2 0 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.179
 put 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.370
 that does not work halfway through so still 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.140
 a zero but also in the second half 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.360
 there is only 1 team that plays football 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.170
 great pass from rommens to the current 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.240
 action of unions and there it is 2 0 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.630
 man with number five participated in also large 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.000
 home is the bad luck he works the ball into 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.209
 own purpose and otherwise bea de stood there 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.890
 ready to tap in and it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.930
 actually the decision in the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 competition because FC Twente had nothing to do with it 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.530
 bring 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.070
 good boss on mountain wine 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.989
 who does everything well inwards 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.290
 but goalkeeper both drunk from FC Twente 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.120
 keeps his team going and keeps the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.760
 damage is limited 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.840
 here dani from the boat and again that keeper 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 and so are all chances for psv a1 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.370
 but failed team of Pascal Jansen 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.200
 the field proportions in goals 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 to express the last chance of the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.290
 contest is for boris you don't mail him 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.510
 tries it nicely 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.100
 it doesn't work it stays beautiful 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.100
 played PSV to place 5
