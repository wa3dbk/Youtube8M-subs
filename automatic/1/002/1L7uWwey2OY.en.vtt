the<00:00:18.130> first<00:00:18.430> category<00:00:18.910> is<00:00:19.570> for<00:00:19.930> best<00:00:20.200> strategy

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
the first category is for best strategy

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.990 
the first category is for best strategy
and<00:00:21.160> simulation<00:00:21.730> game<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:22.210> 2006<00:00:23.200> and<00:00:24.000> this

and simulation game of 2006 and this

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.390 
and simulation game of 2006 and this
probably<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.740> didn't<00:00:27.040> come<00:00:27.160> as<00:00:27.280> a<00:00:27.370> huge

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
probably this didn't come as a huge

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.510 
probably this didn't come as a huge
surprise<00:00:27.640> but<00:00:28.270> I<00:00:28.420> I<00:00:28.840> loved<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:29.410> in<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.280> winner

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
surprise but I I loved it in the winner

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.970 
surprise but I I loved it in the winner
is<00:00:30.670> virtual<00:00:31.060> villagers<00:00:31.349> develop<00:00:32.349> my<00:00:32.500> last<00:00:32.800> day

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
is virtual villagers develop my last day

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:50.290 
is virtual villagers develop my last day
work

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:04.399 

Oh

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.719 

we<00:01:05.409> always<00:01:05.680> felt<00:01:06.040> when<00:01:06.400> we<00:01:06.490> were<00:01:06.580> working

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
we always felt when we were working

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.670 
we always felt when we were working
virtual<00:01:07.180> villagers<00:01:07.299> when<00:01:08.080> we<00:01:08.170> started<00:01:08.560> it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
virtual villagers when we started it

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.850 
virtual villagers when we started it
that<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:09.100> could<00:01:09.340> be<00:01:09.430> something<00:01:09.640> special<00:01:09.850> we<00:01:10.860> we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
that it could be something special we we

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.010 
that it could be something special we we
put<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> lot<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.490> love<00:01:12.700> into<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.000> we<00:01:13.270> we<00:01:13.780> felt

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
put a lot of love into it we we felt

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.560 
put a lot of love into it we we felt
like<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.200> had<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.590> certain<00:01:14.770> magic<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.880> feel

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
like it had a certain magic and I feel

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.660 
like it had a certain magic and I feel
like<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:17.380> look<00:01:17.530> back<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.799> we<00:01:18.190> knew<00:01:18.340> something

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
like we look back and we knew something

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.830 
like we look back and we knew something
was<00:01:18.759> going<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.939> happen<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.390> when<00:01:19.509> this<00:01:19.630> came

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
was going to happen that when this came

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.770 
was going to happen that when this came
out<00:01:20.369> making<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.460> game<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.850> simulates<00:01:22.149> life

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
out making a game that simulates life

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.980 
out making a game that simulates life
like<00:01:23.049> this<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:25.090> easy<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.570> start<00:01:25.780> doing

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
like this is is is easy to start doing

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.050 
like this is is is easy to start doing
but<00:01:26.440> then<00:01:26.680> if<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.190> want<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.520> be<00:01:27.610> realistic

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
but then if you want it to be realistic

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.850 
but then if you want it to be realistic
you<00:01:28.149> have<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.479> leave<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.049> lot<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:29.350> flexibility

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
you have to leave a lot of flexibility

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.020 
you have to leave a lot of flexibility
in<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.100> code<00:01:30.280> there<00:01:30.549> has<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.759> be<00:01:30.789> a<00:01:30.850> lot<00:01:31.000> of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
in the code there has to be a lot of

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.180 
in the code there has to be a lot of
emergent<00:01:31.450> behavior<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:32.080> when<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:32.979> pay<00:01:33.159> your

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
emergent behavior and when you pay your

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.710 
emergent behavior and when you pay your
bills<00:01:33.549> is<00:01:33.850> when<00:01:34.000> it's<00:01:34.119> time<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.270> test<00:01:34.539> and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
bills is when it's time to test and

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.020 
bills is when it's time to test and
debug<00:01:34.810> it's<00:01:35.500> very<00:01:35.799> difficult<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.490> recreate

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
debug it's very difficult to recreate

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.370 
debug it's very difficult to recreate
bugs<00:01:37.390> everything<00:01:37.929> happens<00:01:38.229> differently

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
bugs everything happens differently

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.559 
bugs everything happens differently
every<00:01:38.710> time<00:01:38.830> that's<00:01:39.460> part<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.789> fun<00:01:39.819> but<00:01:40.479> it

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
every time that's part of the fun but it

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.830 
every time that's part of the fun but it
makes<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:40.840> very<00:01:40.869> challenging<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.560> develop<00:01:41.830> I

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
makes it very challenging to develop I

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.270 
makes it very challenging to develop I
think<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.050> classifying<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.890> game<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.250> a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
think that classifying this game is a

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.850 
think that classifying this game is a
strategy<00:01:45.759> game<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:46.149> is<00:01:46.960> only<00:01:47.409> one<00:01:47.649> way<00:01:47.800> to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
strategy game is is only one way to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.649 
strategy game is is only one way to
classify<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.759> lot<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.060> people<00:01:49.270> call<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.569> a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
classify it a lot of people call it a

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.059 
classify it a lot of people call it a
virtual<00:01:49.810> pet<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.289> lot<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.530> people<00:01:50.740> call<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.039> a

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
virtual pet a lot of people call it a

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.940 
virtual pet a lot of people call it a
sim<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.610> lot<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.880> people<00:01:52.060> car<00:01:52.240> an<00:01:52.450> RTS<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:53.229> think

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
sim a lot of people car an RTS I think

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.320 
sim a lot of people car an RTS I think
that<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.429> different<00:01:54.819> games<00:01:54.940> two<00:01:55.030> different

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
that it's different games two different

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.430 
that it's different games two different
people<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:55.780> can<00:01:55.869> be<00:01:55.899> played<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.200> lot<00:01:56.409> of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
people and it can be played a lot of

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.490 
people and it can be played a lot of
different<00:01:56.530> ways<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:58.030> didn't<00:01:58.659> change<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.229> core

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
different ways we didn't change the core

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.740 
different ways we didn't change the core
but<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.860> core<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.069> the<00:02:00.250> game<00:02:00.429> is<00:02:00.610> very<00:02:00.759> open<00:02:01.149> in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
but the core of the game is very open in

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.359 
but the core of the game is very open in
virtual<00:02:02.080> villagers<00:02:02.170> too<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.890> we<00:02:03.009> tried<00:02:03.220> to

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
virtual villagers too so we tried to

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.520 
virtual villagers too so we tried to
keep<00:02:03.549> we<00:02:04.479> tried<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.750> keep<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.020> game<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.319> same

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
keep we tried to keep the game the same

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.009 
keep we tried to keep the game the same
but<00:02:06.250> we<00:02:06.580> added<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.940> bunch<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.390> new<00:02:07.539> toys<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
but we added a bunch of new toys in the

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.020 
but we added a bunch of new toys in the
sandbox<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:09.070> threw<00:02:09.489> in<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.670> bunch<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.910> new

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
sandbox we threw in a bunch of new

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.330 
sandbox we threw in a bunch of new
mechanics<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.320> players<00:02:11.769> not<00:02:11.950> forced<00:02:12.280> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
mechanics but the players not forced to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.670 
mechanics but the players not forced to
do<00:02:12.459> anything<00:02:12.489> there<00:02:13.420> they're<00:02:13.780> exposed<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.620> a
