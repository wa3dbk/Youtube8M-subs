that up Mike's gun is a lifesaver it's
gone<00:02:47.500> lays<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.010> paint<00:02:48.310> down<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.550> hell<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.880> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
gone lays that paint down a hell of a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.560 
gone lays that paint down a hell of a
lot<00:02:49.210> nicer<00:02:49.450> than<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.900> finish<00:02:50.350> line<00:02:50.560> does<00:02:50.860> but

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
lot nicer than that finish line does but

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.760 
lot nicer than that finish line does but
it's<00:02:52.570> kind<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.780> hard<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.080> compare<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> two

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
it's kind of hard to compare the two

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.550 
it's kind of hard to compare the two
guns<00:02:54.070> ones<00:02:54.510> 175<00:02:55.510> dollars<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.170> other<00:02:56.290> ones<00:02:56.470> a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
guns ones 175 dollars the other ones a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.199 
guns ones 175 dollars the other ones a
seven<00:02:56.920> hundred<00:02:57.070> dollar<00:02:57.430> billing<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.060> it's

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
seven hundred dollar billing so it's

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.699 
seven hundred dollar billing so it's
kind<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.570> not<00:02:58.690> even<00:02:58.900> fair<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.230> compare<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
kind of not even fair to compare the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.580 
kind of not even fair to compare the
deep<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.750> could<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:01.840> probably<00:03:01.959> got<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.320> down

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
deep I could have probably got it down

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.290 
deep I could have probably got it down
with<00:03:02.800> my<00:03:02.890> chief<00:03:03.130> gun<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:03.700> I'd<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:03.940> had<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> lot

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
with my chief gun but I'd have had a lot

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.090 
with my chief gun but I'd have had a lot
more<00:03:04.360> headaches<00:03:07.709> tomorrow<00:03:08.709> would<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:09.010> been

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
more headaches tomorrow would have been

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.180 
more headaches tomorrow would have been
the<00:03:09.190> real<00:03:09.370> test<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.910> gun<00:03:10.150> at<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.470> finish

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
the real test of the gun at that finish

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.790 
the real test of the gun at that finish
line<00:03:12.459> gun<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.000> i<00:03:13.060> bought<00:03:13.270> it<00:03:14.170> spray<00:03:14.620> would

line gun that i bought it spray would
have<00:03:14.920> probably<00:03:15.130> struggled<00:03:15.790> really<00:03:16.060> hard<00:03:16.330> with

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420
