00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
statin and lowers them under 160 has

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.009 
statin and lowers them under 160 has
been<00:00:58.449> associated<00:00:58.839> with<00:00:59.320> depression

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019

aggression and suicide and if you add

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.469 
aggression and suicide and if you add
stress<00:01:06.760> in<00:01:07.060> there<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:09.130> how<00:01:10.000> do<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.210> make

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
stress in there well how do you make

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.020 
stress in there well how do you make
stress<00:01:10.840> hormones<00:01:11.350> like<00:01:11.530> cortisol<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.789> come

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
stress hormones like cortisol that come

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.450 
stress hormones like cortisol that come
from<00:01:13.240> cholesterol<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.950> if<00:01:15.039> you<00:01:15.130> have<00:01:15.250> low

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
from cholesterol so if you have low

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.569 
from cholesterol so if you have low
cholesterol<00:01:15.969> levels<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.130> you're<00:01:18.130> stressed

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
cholesterol levels and you're stressed

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.660 
cholesterol levels and you're stressed
you<00:01:19.450> have<00:01:19.630> no<00:01:20.020> material<00:01:20.320> left<00:01:21.070> over<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.640> make

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
you have no material left over to make

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.669 
you have no material left over to make
estrogen<00:01:22.359> progesterone<00:01:22.899> or<00:01:23.229> testosterone

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
estrogen progesterone or testosterone

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.950 
estrogen progesterone or testosterone
and<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.600> learning<00:01:26.140> how<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:27.509> manage<00:01:28.509> your
