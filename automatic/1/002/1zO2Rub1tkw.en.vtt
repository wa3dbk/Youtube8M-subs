00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
make this fast so I have a broad the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.209

Little<00:00:32.489> Miss<00:00:32.610> Sunshine<00:00:32.790> soundtrack<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:34.890> want

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
Little Miss Sunshine soundtrack we want

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.959 
Little Miss Sunshine soundtrack we want
to<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.780> together<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:38.550> would<00:00:38.730> choose

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
to use that together and I would choose

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.190 
to use that together and I would choose
this<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.660> their<00:00:40.140> lyrics<00:00:40.559> are<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:42.170> risque

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this but their lyrics are kind of risque

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.799 
this but their lyrics are kind of risque
dirty<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> figured<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> wouldn't<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
dirty so I figured that wouldn't be a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.700 
dirty so I figured that wouldn't be a
good<00:00:45.930> idea<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.820> big<00:00:47.820> band

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
good idea and big band

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.990 
good idea and big band

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
lame is the musical figured that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.910 
lame is the musical figured that
wouldn't<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.600> right<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:01.230> uh<00:01:01.680> oceans<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.699> love

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
