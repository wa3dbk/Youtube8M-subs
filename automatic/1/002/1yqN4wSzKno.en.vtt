00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.510
 the front premium brands were sold 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.100
 land rover and jack involving the indian 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.690
 right 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.480
 Martin was taken over by one 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.130
 group of investors and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.830
 perseverance ended up with chinese 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.010
 you depend on the law 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.510
 common technique 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.650
 but now they are almost five years 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 further 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.610
 now comes or comes with a real one 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.210
 own platform and scalable 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.040
 architecture the first car to it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 new platforms this completely new one 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.910
 xc90 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
 this replaces the previous generation xc90 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.870
 who sat with him for thirteen years already 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 for nature environment once so 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.800
 very tall and beautiful she is build in man 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.880
 China still passing by for the local 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 market 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.119
 but good for us we are 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 completely new he is still 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.899
 clearer but our volvo 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.630
 tight straightforward 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.560
 Scandinavian design but then 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 all the way 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 many women 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.140
 sober the design we think so too 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.390
 back in the interior and the used 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.580
 materials wood leather 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.590
 really scandinavia that is design 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.149
 incidentally, the yes purely focused on 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.159
 functionality but on a whole 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.799
 nice way but that car can be 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.990
 very intuitive operation 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.689
 at the center of it were large but also 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.210
 especially fast-acting touchscreen in the middle 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.479
 the dashboard or then it comes to 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.140
 seat heating steering heating 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.720
 climate control 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.100
 traffic sign recognition to it 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.259
 settings 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.410
 it's all very simple and it 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.340
 responds well yes the really see if 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.340
 zelda of this level 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.150
 we always follow safety and pushing 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.710
 been a spearhead and that is with this 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.060
 car drives no different 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.710
 is a list of safety features 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 from too long to fun video from too 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.120
 so we would do that 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.500
 he zooms in but nice to mention 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.620
 fast it 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.880
 we have their offroad protection system that 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.630
 takes effect the moment you turn off 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.010
 hits the road 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.840
 of course to all other systems 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.160
 still have attempted to get you on that 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.050
 to keep away but good was there then 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.209
 still wrong then yes then make sure system 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.220
 that all passengers as much as possible 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.620
 be protected with the impact that way 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.860
 minimal is another nice one 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.600
 system what ensures that when you 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.320
 for example, turn left into a cross 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.790
 cross 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.770
 current system in the go vlog 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.780
 oncoming traffic arrives and was allowed 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.239
 That being the case, the car seizes 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.880
 silent and must prevent the collision 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.360
 be that is all part of it 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.050
 great program that has volvo to go to 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.110
 2020 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.060
 Having 0 dead on his conscience and 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.239
 people with then follows a piece en route 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.239
 to be 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
 Oh 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.400
 nb 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.580
 and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.019
 the previous generation was far behind 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.760
 of course the maximum you get 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.510
 but that is not there this time 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.650
 center 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.420
 said before we are not going anymore 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.159
 Continue four cylinders and then hold 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.409
 the me you with also applies to this car 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.819
 what can be thought is back to 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.720
 t4 is t5 is t8 or d4 is d5 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.170
 in basic and yet all 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.519
 four-wheel drive today 4 to one 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.609
 prefer to float 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.079
 well we are now on the road with the d5 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.849
 yes that is very nice car 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.239
 who actually has little trouble getting around 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.880
 this car nice and comfortable going 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.840
 bring and hold 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.940
 it looks a bit nice with it 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.460
 chassis with and comfortable 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.350
 He is absolutely nothing wrong with that and yes 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.240
 not overly noisy 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.800
 yes should it disturb that sound 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.530
 pops with the push of a button 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.510
 briefly transform the car into it 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.440
 Gothenburg Concert Hall 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.870
 because they also have it in the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.660
 sound system stopped but good thing 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.180
 money to say no really what it is about 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.650
 is yes it is actually the ideal 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:54.060
 engine for the sober Dutchman are 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:56.160
 so at first sight say how about 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.270
 t overnight with its muscles actual 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.190
 old for the sober Dutchman 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.099
 maybe their say and you for it 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.110
 the calculated awkward because there is one 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.110
 plug to it is a plug-in hybrid 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.770
 and then this means case 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.310
 addition percentage for the business 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.260
 14% driver only after tracking 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.970
 of course as a party 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.650
 especially if you remember to order the hood 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.380
 a four-cylinder petrol engine comes with 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.030
 318 hp at the rear axle 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.310
 electric motor with 82 hp 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.630
 yes on paper it looks like it 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.250
 that it's okay 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.820
 but well the farther away it is than going 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.820
 we give them a try 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.430
 according to full van you need this car 40km 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.190
 can drive electrically but that 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.660
 believe west but we did not succeed 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.730
 and I actually have a reason to 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.710
 rand well there 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.110
 petrol engine and the electric motor 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.280
 working together purely as a madman 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.170
 by 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.550
 within six sets are 100 and yes 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.030
 and intermediate prints also it all goes 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.570
 so smooth and easy yes you have more 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.590
 not necessary 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.590
 and that for 14 percent additional tax 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.620
 the only thing with the plug-in hybrid of 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.610
 inside otherwise that is actually the 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.080
 gear stick 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.130
 who will have pulled out of the 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.130
 or crystal 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.420
 want to use video too closely or 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.860
 nice and ecological in the hallway we go 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.450
 you do need concessions on interior space 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.590
 impossible 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.910
 from the first sketches for 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.490
 platform they have a 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.590
 Battery pack kept them neat and tidy 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.790
 concealed in the middle tunnel 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.670
 and therefore he is also like 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.210
 plug-in hybrid just a seven-seater 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.160
 That 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.470
 seats 6 and 7 is in heaven in the back 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.180
 And yes often you can barely have children 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.830
 lost but that falls with this car 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.810
 by the way another one up to a meter 70 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.970
 you can sit comfortably in the back 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.130
 you sometimes see it differently and so do he 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.800
 another reasonable 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.320
 luggage oven you usually have the 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.490
 seven is not much more than 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.850
 place for a couple of sandwich bag but 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.320
 no yes you can still put a few bags in it 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.640
 if you still want to take more with you 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.610
 can also buy a trailer 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.280
 hanging behind because there may be as many as 22 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.260
 100 pounds pull this t8 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.980
 well it is sometimes to 500 pounds 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.060
 less than what the d5 is allowed to do 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.640
 will naturally timid absolutely no 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.920
 carts behind are allowed so that they have nice 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.550
 for each other and all in all we can 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.000
 feel free to say this t8 and the v8 live 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.000
 must forget 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.080
 and
