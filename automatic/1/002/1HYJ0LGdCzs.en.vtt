is<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.949> another<00:01:05.100> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> mech<00:01:05.790> build

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is going for another kind of mech build

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
is going for another kind of mech build
here<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:06.900> surprised<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.560> didn't<00:01:07.799> work

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
here I'm very surprised it didn't work

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
here I'm very surprised it didn't work
out<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.159> flash<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.150> sure<00:01:09.390> why<00:01:09.570> he's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
out for flash so I'm not sure why he's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.649 
out for flash so I'm not sure why he's
trying<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:11.390> think<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.570> have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
trying it here I think it would have

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210 
trying it here I think it would have
been<00:01:12.720> better<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.260> medic<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.950> Marines

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
been better to go for medic and Marines

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.410 
been better to go for medic and Marines
but<00:01:14.520> we'll<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.000> happens

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
but we'll see what happens

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.980 
but we'll see what happens
scourge<00:01:16.580> almost<00:01:17.580> let's<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> scourge

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
scourge almost let's see if the scourge

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.450 
scourge almost let's see if the scourge
will<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.500> able<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:19.950> Valkyrie<00:01:20.369> it

up there we'll see if he pushes out soon
to<00:03:06.690> take<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.020> out<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:08.700> lot<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.880> overlords

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
to take it out and a lot of overlords

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.450 
to take it out and a lot of overlords
here<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> middle<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.380> we<00:03:10.680> couldn't<00:03:11.340> be

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
here in the middle so we couldn't be

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.910 
here in the middle so we couldn't be
seeing<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.760> drop<00:03:11.940> from<00:03:12.120> did<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.360> play<00:03:12.630> soon<00:03:12.920> he

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
probably realizes he can't break through

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.690 
probably realizes he can't break through
that<00:03:15.780> oh<00:03:16.050> not<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> good<00:03:16.500> time<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.950> drop<00:03:17.130> the

that oh not a good time to drop the
fantasy<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.600> moving<00:03:18.930> out<00:03:19.050> right<00:03:19.080> now<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.440> did

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
fantasy is moving out right now so did

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.620 
fantasy is moving out right now so did
you<00:03:19.980> play<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.250> gonna<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.700> drop<00:03:21.090> back<00:03:21.330> onto

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
you play is gonna have to drop back onto

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.800 
you play is gonna have to drop back onto
the<00:03:21.930> center<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.230> think<00:03:22.910> -<00:03:23.910> well<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.570> looks<00:03:24.750> like

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the center I think - well it looks like

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.690 
the center I think - well it looks like
he's<00:03:25.110> still<00:03:25.410> committing<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.040> drop<00:03:26.370> but

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
he's still committing to this drop but

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.460 
he's still committing to this drop but
fantasy<00:03:27.240> is<00:03:27.450> gonna<00:03:27.630> know<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.960> coming<00:03:28.290> those

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.040 
fantasy is gonna know it's coming those

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
Valkyries might eat up this drop oh no I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.720 
Valkyries might eat up this drop oh no I
think<00:03:31.260> those<00:03:31.470> overlords<00:03:31.980> are<00:03:32.190> gonna<00:03:32.370> go<00:03:32.550> down

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
think those overlords are gonna go down

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.220

at<00:03:32.910> least<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.240> Overlord<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.810> going<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.110> go

at least one Overlord is going to go
down<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:35.430> looks<00:03:35.580> like<00:03:35.730> he's<00:03:35.910> still<00:03:36.090> committing

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
down it looks like he's still committing

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.760 
down it looks like he's still committing
to<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.660> drop<00:03:36.960> though<00:03:37.140> going<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.500> push

from this I think fantasy might actually

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.430 
from this I think fantasy might actually
have<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.810> advantage<00:04:34.810> here<00:04:34.990> because<00:04:35.020> he<00:04:35.289> is

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
have the advantage here because he is

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.350 
have the advantage here because he is

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
too but managed to rip through three

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.230

games<00:06:56.870> in<00:06:57.050> a<00:06:57.140> row<00:06:57.170> we'll<00:06:57.500> see<00:06:57.740> if<00:06:57.860> he<00:06:58.010> can

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
games in a row we'll see if he can

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.690 
games in a row we'll see if he can
recapture<00:06:59.240> that<00:06:59.570> twice<00:07:00.100> this<00:07:01.100> has<00:07:01.280> been<00:07:01.490> nuke
