00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.340
 Welcome to the shop of rarities! What are you pleased? 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Thank you very much! Come again! 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 People from Zaia sometimes look to us. Their magicians heal our sick. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.500
 The products we produce here are sold all over the continent! 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 Feliciano 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.300
 II don't intend to go outside the village at all! 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.670
 I just wanted to say that if you are done with all the tasks, then we return to the inn. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.600
 I ask the locals a little more about the forest. 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.900
 I want you to stay in the room and look after things. Do not go anywhere! 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.300
 Yes sir! 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.000
 Fuh, well, finally I can get out. 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.330
 And it is convenient. So fade and appear, I mean. 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.000
 I was afraid that if I was visible, people would be able to notice me. 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.400
 It seems that Ger ... that is, Ludwig did not suspect anything. 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.000
 I was amazed how much Ludwig looked like my friend! He even has the same language! 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.480
 True? Maybe it's because we are alike, so our friends are alike too? 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.550
 By the way, I suddenly jumped at you with a request to take my place, that I did not even find out anything about you. 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.400
 I don't know much about you either. 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.500
 I wonder why I did not ask you a single question on the way here? 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.100
 It's not too late to catch up! Oh, where are you from? I come from Sapinia. 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.900
 Are you by any chance from Ragmenia? 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.600
 Uh ... no. 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.400
 From Avnir? Although it is quite far from here. 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.200
 I don’t think you will believe me, but in fact I’m not from this world at all. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.440
 I found myself in this world after I opened the book that the mysterious stranger gave me. 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.340
 And in fact, I really want to return to my world as soon as possible. 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.600
 (He probably thinks I'm crazy!) 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.500
 Fantasy! I first meet someone from another world! 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.840
 Do you believe me?! 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.900
 Long ago, we often contacted the inhabitants of other worlds. 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.800
 I'm so happy! I always wanted to see a person from another world! 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.140
 Don't you know how to move from one world to another? 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.020
 I want to go back to my world as soon as I finish fulfilling your request. 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.800
 Sorry. That was a long time ago. I don't know anything else. 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.930
 And I can never return? 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.500
 Perhaps, if you ask Elder of the village of Zaiya, will he tell you more? I heard he knows a lot! 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.400
 True?! Now I even had hope! 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.000
 I will help you back to your world too! 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.800
 Grazie, Feliciano! 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.470
 If you are from another world, then it is better for me to explain to you the geography and structure of our world. 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.900
 There is a map here, so I will tell and show. 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.100
 We are here now. This is Laithia. 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.100
 And this continent is called Leben, it is ruled by the Empire of Era. 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.360
 Zaiya, the goal of our journey, is in this area and is autonomy. 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.500
 That is why their culture is unique! 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.300
 I already mentioned the name of this continent - Avnir. On it is located the kingdom of Al. 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.100
 The north is covered with green forests, but the rest of the continent is desert. 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.000
 This continent is called the Past. It is ruled by the Empire of the Century. 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.300
 I have never been there, but I heard that there is nothing on it but snow. 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.600
 In short, I think everything. Although we have other cities. Do you want me to tell you about them? 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.500
 Let's stop at this. Even if you tell me something else, I still have everything out of my head. 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.430
 Thanks for the info, Feliciano! 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.200
 It seems that now to go into the forest is really too dangerous. There are not only wild beasts, but also chimeras. 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.400
 Outside the village, they were also, right? 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.400
 Damn it. So it is true that they are approaching the outskirts of Laithia. 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.600
 I wonder what they need ... 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.300
 All we know is that they certainly have an unnatural origin. I hope we will be able to enlist the support of Zaia. 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.500
 Elder Zaia - I wonder what he is? I hope that he will be a glorious little. 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.100
 I hope. 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.000
 Will we stay here for the night? 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.280
 Yes. We get up early tomorrow. Try now to relax. 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.700
 Italy looked into the wooden box! 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.290
 Found seafood!
