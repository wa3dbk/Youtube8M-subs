00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello we are the film crew 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.940
 speed bob 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.940
 welcome to the space far west 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.869
 Yes 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.699
 a year ago 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.529
 am bob explains the goal was to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.640
 cross a lot 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.860
 of environments has said everything 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.390
 we created a universe that 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.040
 mixed wild west and cinema 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.110
 operating from the 80s as a star 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 wars or trailing this as early as the phase of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.590
 concept we have created a wide panel 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.910
 the environment that associated with the universe 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.400
 tankers with his Kenyan and some 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.290
 reds as well as the spirit of the 60s 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.519
 good excuse for a shopping the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.199
 reaper to put to the image of bob 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.500
 and include the elements essential to its 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.659
 survival 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.970
 a 1-channel diesel engine manchester and 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.650
 beer and main challenge 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.120
 was the imposing heavy rand and 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.560
 functional once the bodywork 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.970
 make and create a stock of parts 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.990
 mechanical and hydraulic that I have 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.700
 assembled consistently 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.080
 this allowed to add detail there 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.970
 we needed it according to plans 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.799
 from the meadow to characterize it I 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.049
 created dust dirt mac 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.430
 grooves and greece once the textures 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.260
 finished I assembled the different 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.049
 layers of maya to have a maximum of 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.070
 control during the schedule the creature 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.280
 tavae treat yourself tent 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 she is a kind of crustacean with and 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.420
 offensive machine behavior 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.760
 they are nurtured by oil work 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.260
 so we added a language 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.910
 of state millions so she can 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.340
 catch his food 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.450
 the concept was done on this brooch 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.450
 shock shock 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.090
 it is then modeled on maya 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.120
 chat on a pin and textures and 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.570
 underwater cheddar in the hard cra and 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.000
 multilayer its own color and css 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.440
 as well as a layer of oil per fabric 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.520
 for animation 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.470
 we worked in collaboration 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.360
 with tintin birere students 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.710
 specialists in this shelter as well as 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.550
 three other students specializing in 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.710
 animations 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.050
 tristan and 20 arturo perez and guillaume 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.119
 the main challenge for 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.099
 the animation and and the ride plans must 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.860
 to be both homogeneous dynamics and 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.930
 understandable over long periods 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.610
 for animating creatures the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.380
 main reference was the cow in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.120
 his general behavior and the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.070
 grasshopper his jumps in the planes ride 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.420
 for bob he had to find a good 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.280
 compromise between the length and the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.080
 speed and since it's a brute 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 should not worry about damaging her 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.060
 jersey to catch the creature 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.010
 we will create a 3d environment 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.650
 according to the distance like that and that you 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.450
 gives we modeled and 18.8 of 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.209
 blame on this branch is textured 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.610
 with fifes Anthony married in tanguay 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.730
 homebox shop according to him a break or a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.350
 tube are once rotate sky and 30 late 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.970
 with ten pebbles we 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.770
 arrived added random on 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.110
 scenes of several kilometers we 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.670
 we also used the show that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.230
 we served to add a layer of 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.970
 details on the soils of the environments 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.650
 you very quickly and randomly 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.340
 if for certain environments like the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.320
 oil station 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.610
 we used two instant singh 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.350
 to go much faster 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.300
 remaining time being rendered very 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.950
 correct we asked to matter 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.660
 fine students specializing in 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.070
 environment to achieve for both of us 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.110
 fixed shots of the final sequence 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.430
 the lighting rendering phase was 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.110
 crucial I had to create a workflow 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.940
 effective to lose the least amount of time 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.799
 possible to adjust each new scene 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.209
 for that we have set up 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.200
 physically correct shader who 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.610
 react to any type 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.680
 lighting which allowed us 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.570
 save a lot of time when 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.700
 lighting to avoid blowing up 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.230
 rendering times we converted 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.090
 almost all environments 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.810
 we would see the cops proxy in speed 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.810
 bob that's it 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.519
 the fx of the movie were set up on the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.650
 different software nothing the blur for 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.510
 the oil the catho has for fumes 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.129
 light and the reactors and finally smoke 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.110
 fixed for explosions and flames 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.640
 the challenge of fx was the quantity 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.870
 without compromising the quality 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.580
 I had to set up to see flow 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.870
 fast and efficient to simulate the big 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.879
 number of destructions and explosions 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.260
 necessary to the film I worked in 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.060
 direct and permanent link with Benjamin 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.530
 compositing in order to win in 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.150
 efficiency and in time by having 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.680
 quick preview of fx in the clan 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.970
 for the needs of a complex plan 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.040
 we used sÃ©bastien bach 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.049
 these students specialize in fx jacques 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.400
 rey highlights a series of explosions that 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.919
 I then arranged in winter 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.360
 variant through the others I 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.010
 then made all this under contract 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.750
 allowing to cross the boxes 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.770
 of escape without detonating the tender 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.880
 for live shots 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.440
 it was necessary to build inside the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.950
 reaper then we pray her years and 15 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.950
 and in chemistry 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.740
 the goal was for us to make a 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.900
 filming course with little progress on 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.530
 the speed bob plan is the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.470
 testosterone 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.900
 the coup to compose it was necessary to soften 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.820
 as sublime and aestheticized to the maximum 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.010
 the plans siggi those plans had to 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.400
 also be connected to the maximum with 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.400
 live plans 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.930
 compositing was a very important step 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.300
 important of the film because it mattered 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.250
 a lot about the overall aesthetics the 2d 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.509
 was very useful in speed ball for the 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.330
 graphic design and the different networks of 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.919
 but especially for the extensions of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.080
 3d environments by adding 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.520
 mountains to extend the depth and 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.430
 of course also for fawns 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.990
 stars and planets it's blake 2d 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.039
 have been implemented thanks to 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.020
 3d nuke space 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.130
 thanks again to all the people who 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.870
 we followed and supported on this 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.259
 project hoping not to see art and 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.259
 your sensitivity
