00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
doing some stuff on an earlier I must

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.860 
doing some stuff on an earlier I must
have<00:02:15.840> walked<00:02:16.020> over<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:18.270> then<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.720> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
have walked over there but then as you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.690 
have walked over there but then as you
can<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.380> can<00:02:19.650> still<00:02:19.890> reap<00:02:20.190> line<00:02:20.430> they're

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
can see you can still reap line they're

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.260 
can see you can still reap line they're
all<00:02:20.880> from<00:02:22.370> here<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:25.280> kind<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.400> replant<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.220 

yeah<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.630> still<00:02:30.900> reap<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:33.200> nah<00:02:34.200> i

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
yeah you can still reap are now nah i

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.560 
yeah you can still reap are now nah i
cant<00:02:34.260> replant<00:02:35.100> now<00:02:35.720> what's<00:02:36.720> happened<00:02:41.570> pretty

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
cant replant now what's happened pretty

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.030 
cant replant now what's happened pretty
sure<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.290> reach<00:02:44.070> all<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.640> ah<00:02:45.920> i<00:02:46.920> see

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
sure you can reach all of this ah i see

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.850 
sure you can reach all of this ah i see
a<00:02:47.370> problem<00:02:48.500> I've<00:02:49.730> done<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.600> all<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.230> creative

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
a problem I've done this all in creative

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.620 
a problem I've done this all in creative
so<00:02:53.100> yeah<00:02:53.240> reach<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.510> slightly<00:02:55.260> longer<00:02:56.630> mmm

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
so yeah reach is slightly longer mmm

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.560 
so yeah reach is slightly longer mmm
could<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> little<00:02:58.350> problem<00:02:59.570> didn't

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
could have a little problem didn't

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.670 
could have a little problem didn't
realize<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:06.480> reach<00:03:06.690> most<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.560> it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
realize that you can reach most of it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.670 
realize that you can reach most of it
like<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.630> yeah<00:03:09.630> anyway<00:03:10.020> s<00:03:10.110> all<00:03:10.650> good<00:03:12.380> you'd<00:03:13.380> so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
like so yeah anyway s all good you'd so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.040 
like so yeah anyway s all good you'd so
basically<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.610> would<00:03:14.790> get<00:03:15.000> exactly<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.570> stack

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
basically you would get exactly a stack

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.890 
basically you would get exactly a stack
of<00:03:16.080> wheat<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.680> think<00:03:17.300> or<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:19.250> stack<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.460> one

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
of wheat I think or a stack and one

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.280 
of wheat I think or a stack and one
which<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.110> fairly<00:03:22.440> good<00:03:23.340> anyway<00:03:23.820> still<00:03:24.290> even

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
which is fairly good anyway still even

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.890 
which is fairly good anyway still even
though<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.440> can't<00:03:25.830> quite<00:03:26.310> reach<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.640> ohh<00:03:29.900> but

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
though you can't quite reach it ohh but

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.230 
though you can't quite reach it ohh but
yet<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.290> all<00:03:31.590> starts<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.400> stops<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.180> from

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
yet this all starts and stops you from

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.610 
yet this all starts and stops you from
walking<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:33.990> there's<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.440> high

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
walking on because there's a to high

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.830 
walking on because there's a to high
space<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.300> are<00:03:36.420> thinking<00:03:36.600> of

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
space here and if you are thinking of

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.210 
space here and if you are thinking of
building<00:03:36.990> this<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.350> have<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.710> that<00:03:37.920> one

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
building this you have to have that one

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.420 
building this you have to have that one
higher<00:03:38.520> of<00:03:38.730> wise<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.840> don't<00:03:40.110> hit<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.190> tube

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
higher of wise you don't hit the tube

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.180 
higher of wise you don't hit the tube
blocks<00:03:42.120> acres<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.660> already<00:03:42.990> in<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.800> two-block

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
blocks acres you already in a two-block

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.360 
blocks acres you already in a two-block
area<00:03:44.310> see<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.209> just<00:03:45.300> grew<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.890> bit<00:03:47.130> grow<00:03:47.310> as

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
area see I just grew that bit grow as

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.850 
area see I just grew that bit grow as
well<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:48.660> yeah<00:03:48.840> that's<00:03:48.959> good<00:03:49.260> if<00:03:49.410> we'll<00:03:49.709> go

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
well but yeah that's good if we'll go

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.270 
well but yeah that's good if we'll go
down<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.190> wiring<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:52.650> lock<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.220> I

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
down to the wiring just lock that I

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.330 
down to the wiring just lock that I
think<00:03:53.580> it's<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.880> lot<00:03:55.430> yet<00:03:56.430> down<00:03:56.670> is<00:03:56.880> locked<00:03:57.120> up<00:03:58.340> y

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
think it's a lot yet down is locked up y

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.050 
think it's a lot yet down is locked up y
SI<00:03:59.730> go<00:04:00.270> back<00:04:00.450> into<00:04:01.070> creative<00:04:02.070> downer<00:04:02.340> so

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
SI go back into creative downer so

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.699 
SI go back into creative downer so
basically<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.630> all<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> same<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.170> lot<00:04:04.470> neater

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
basically it's all the same a lot neater

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.640 
basically it's all the same a lot neater
though<00:04:05.010> I've<00:04:05.100> got<00:04:05.160> red<00:04:05.880> wall<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:07.410> is

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
though I've got red wall so this is

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.710 
though I've got red wall so this is
below<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.400> pressure<00:04:08.760> plate<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.540> gets

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
below the pressure plate and that gets

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.080 
below the pressure plate and that gets
activities<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.770> torch<00:04:11.130> off<00:04:11.490> which<00:04:11.820> turns

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
activities this torch off which turns

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.120 
activities this torch off which turns
this<00:04:12.330> off<00:04:12.570> which<00:04:13.020> allows<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.470> torch<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.950> come

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
this off which allows this torch to come

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.729 
this off which allows this torch to come
on<00:04:14.310> which<00:04:14.700> powers<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.720> then<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.440> torch

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
on which powers this and then this torch

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.590 
on which powers this and then this torch
can't<00:04:17.040> turn<00:04:17.310> back<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.870> okay<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.109> then<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.380> is

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
can't turn back on okay and then this is

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.650 
can't turn back on okay and then this is
basically<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.930> output<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.620> when<00:04:22.740> this<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.070> on

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
basically the output so when this is on

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.880 
basically the output so when this is on
when<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.750> tread<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.530> pressure<00:04:25.740> plate

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
when you tread on the pressure plate

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.260 
when you tread on the pressure plate
this<00:04:26.220> goes<00:04:26.460> off

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
this goes off

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.740 
this goes off
and<00:04:27.569> if<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.139> one's<00:04:28.379> off<00:04:28.590> as<00:04:28.770> well<00:04:29.009> which<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
and if that one's off as well which is

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.529 
and if that one's off as well which is
controlled<00:04:30.750> by<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:32.340> lever<00:04:32.580> which<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.300> up

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
controlled by the lever which is up

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.290 
controlled by the lever which is up
there<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.889> comes<00:04:35.039> down<00:04:35.310> here<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.940> reason<00:04:36.210> you

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
there it comes down here the reason you

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.760 
there it comes down here the reason you
have<00:04:36.389> to<00:04:36.479> have<00:04:36.569> them<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:36.900> wise<00:04:37.110> they<00:04:37.289> connect

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
have to have them of wise they connect

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.460 
have to have them of wise they connect
and<00:04:37.979> don't<00:04:38.250> work<00:04:38.629> yeah<00:04:39.629> that<00:04:39.870> comes<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.379> then

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
and don't work yeah that comes and then
