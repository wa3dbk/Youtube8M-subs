00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.830
 Skate Board Galley My Name Tells 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.600
 It's louis and today I'm going to comment on the game of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.189
 kitty online you played on our channel in 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
 partnership with the skateboarding voice and 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 a lot of people saw the video but understood 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.590
 How was I judged today? 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:21.449
 and make some additional comments 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 about the good first game maneuvers 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.560
 I'll explain how the game works. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.269
 we have assembled a secret group in the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.859
 facebook where we can the maneuvers of 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 video until the game is over 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 was drawn the order of skaters 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 randomly and the first to be 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 chosen was the year then the year had 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 two days to send the video of the maneuver 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 him and from the day he posts the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 video the other skaters had until 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
 three days to send a video hit 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 the same maneuver 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 if someone does not have this new has 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 some letter and thus complete if it spoke 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 skate is out of the game 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 that's why some of us have taken 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.379
 letters that a new one are wines and with 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 for example squirrel tolerating flip then 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.530
 letter that does not know how to make a new one 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 but he took letters because he did not deliver 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 the video good time 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.030
 Now come on, I'll comment on the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 maneuvers of our game 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.760
 the first maneuver of each one of us 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 we agreed that it could not be a work 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.610
 very advanced then when it started 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.610
 making a click 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.840
 soon after that the end fell and the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.840
 usual his first letter 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:44.750
 the first health club maneuver goes to 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:55.729
 show also fix to ride the first 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:57.679
 variable maneuver reverses second 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:06.140
 round the book of works has already disappeared and 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:08.209
 the first night maneuver was not 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.709
 resisting and then a little flip a 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.239
 a work that was very difficult for me 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.549
 because I have a lot of trouble 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.940
 some reason this worked out and after 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.940
 two days 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.330
 the defendant because a new clip and curiously 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.280
 this was the only work I did not record in 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.280
 door of the condo that is traveling 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.820
 then I had it varied on the flick and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.440
 At that time I bet many of you 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.570
 they did not understand anything because it 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.350
 Golf letter but will hit to the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.390
 golf 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.130
 this happened only sent to the flip 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.180
 time and I do not want to knit 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.950
 cool this kind of game is that you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.620
 force you to lose the words you do not know 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.269
 I would say that 50% of the maneuvers to be 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.680
 Their game was what I had to learn. 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.329
 just in time 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.370
 This is so cool that timóteo that 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.470
 you really want you can be any 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.540
 a new wish even if in the crap 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.130
 as for example goes where fipe that does not 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.410
 I knew how to do it but I left the camera. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.799
 recording and have a thousand times to accept more 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.840
 without ever having done before speaking in value 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.670
 from Philip the bus out there this maneuver 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.049
 It's a funny thing here in the group and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.120
 posted a video and showed the middle finger 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.150
 and will deposit the maneuver I found 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.160
 funny including final video 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.120
 now we are going to the semifinal in which the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.120
 squirrel israel 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.610
 I said I said that I had just 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.800
 learn all 62 good 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:43.750
 but who sent it done 360 ​​flip all 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:45.430
 world has also hit the beauty 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.350
 there already has complicated the work 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.240
 very creative the beque foot kasper 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.240
 filipe or anti castro son 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.430
 I then had the pre-show night suite 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:04.380
 flip that I learned especially for the 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.380
 video on the internet 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.430
 but who sent off flip a work that the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.360
 The defendant has a bit of difficulty but 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.490
 all right and then I jumped the window goes 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.430
 then start with that unit and button 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.890
 new suite clip and expensive or lousy 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.030
 Felipe suite maneuver and whiskey we take 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.030
 two new leadership 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.530
 I keep made them have a maneuver 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.330
 that doug does not lose only to Portuguese and 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.830
 finally resulted in a letter 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.630
 At that time I was relieved because I 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.160
 I knew that I was very good and I was 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.320
 as he is someone without taking any 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.790
 Legend also find out if you are 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.890
 watching this video you see something for 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.940
 You take that letter of what? 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.010
 The offender was relieved when a 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.600
 car 360 north fipe 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.670
 I liked to learn this maneuver 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.380
 and is an example of how this type of game 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.180
 that shows you can hit 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.530
 any maneuver and never thought that 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.530
 accept the 360 ​​flip 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.770
 I keep turning back a maneuver that 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.480
 It took me days trying to lose the squirrel. 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.470
 someone in this new one then me and rafael 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.470
 we went to the finals 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.330
 from now on the game is very 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.310
 at least it's foggy for me to send 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:30.700
 a trio fipe a new one that I almost 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:32.950
 sure but could not get back 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.370
 a line 540 that yielded a letter to 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.370
 Her too 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.870
 the real sent another suite owns it 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.650
 ratify and I did not even come 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.650
 to accept 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.560
 At this time I thought I 'd lose the game. 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.480
 so attractive to the maneuvers I 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.600
 I know that the body, for example without 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:01.330
 firm but also the success he had in 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.760
 back the raith dalfre by luck I 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:18.310
 I have also hit badly fitted but 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:19.870
 I got one more creative from Rafael 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.820
 Send me I get kicked with my feet. 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.820
 crossed the next June flu 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.740
 At this time I felt that the end is 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.520
 close and the boss is the last work of 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.820
 my dreams 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.620
 the fed flip then another letter from the 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.620
 Rafael and left the Argentine pepe 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.760
 on the back ray when beck football fpf 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.680
 always using the scheme he took 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.620
 means that we had already done 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.930
 improve a little by doing 366 flip 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.090
 that later the people of 9 bec futile 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.570
 team but if you prepare well 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:01.919
 were 365 flip a very blurry work 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.919
 who had never seen anyone doing 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.700
 also the last letter of this maneuver and the 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.080
 defendant was the champion of this game 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.820
 I was very happy for him because he 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.740
 deserved I was very happy 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.540
 the general game too many people were 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.220
 hot and the dog the maneuvers very poorly 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.620
 but if you think what I 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.630
 I spoke with 50% of all the maneuvers of this 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.240
 game we learned in three days or 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.620
 less was a very difficult game and required 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.660
 a lot of determination to get where 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.000
 arrived and I hope my experience 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.590
 with you this team and you also help 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.060
 of your friends that you will evolve 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.280
 enough 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.750
 who knows in the next game we'll call 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.700
 some of you registered for 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.470
 then stay connected here at 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.650
 channel that sign up so as not to lose 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.650
 this opportunity 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.630
 For today, it's only personal if you want to check it out. 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.500
 the channel of the defendant the skate is only a click 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.500
 in this image here 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.230
 is
