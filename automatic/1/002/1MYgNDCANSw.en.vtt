00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
definitely a cool back design however

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.970 
definitely a cool back design however
looking<00:06:31.060> at<00:06:31.240> the<00:06:31.390> decks<00:06:31.780> that<00:06:31.960> come<00:06:32.170> prior<00:06:32.950> to

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
looking at the decks that come prior to

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.870 
looking at the decks that come prior to
this<00:06:33.790> edition<00:06:34.060> of<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:34.630> blade<00:06:34.990> series<00:06:35.560> is<00:06:35.880> just

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
this edition of the blade series is just

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.999 
this edition of the blade series is just
a<00:06:37.030> little<00:06:37.270> disappointing

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
a little disappointing

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.579 
a little disappointing
so<00:06:38.759> the<00:06:39.089> overall<00:06:39.210> look<00:06:39.599> of<00:06:39.749> this<00:06:39.869> deck<00:06:40.139> I<00:06:40.379> would

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.589 
so the overall look of this deck I would

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:45.079 
so the overall look of this deck I would
have<00:06:40.860> to<00:06:41.159> give<00:06:41.339> a<00:06:42.139> 3<00:06:43.139> out<00:06:43.409> of<00:06:43.680> 5<00:06:43.979> the<00:06:44.699> handling

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
have to give a 3 out of 5 the handling

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.899 
have to give a 3 out of 5 the handling
feel<00:06:45.330> this<00:06:45.539> deck<00:06:45.779> is<00:06:45.990> really<00:06:46.889> nice<00:06:47.039> the<00:06:47.610> cards

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
feel this deck is really nice the cards

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:50.179 
feel this deck is really nice the cards
do<00:06:48.089> clump<00:06:48.389> in<00:06:48.539> some<00:06:48.719> areas<00:06:49.139> but<00:06:49.169> it's<00:06:49.680> minor

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
do clump in some areas but it's minor

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.389 
do clump in some areas but it's minor
the<00:06:50.909> the<00:06:51.689> deck<00:06:51.899> feels<00:06:52.139> really<00:06:52.559> soft<00:06:52.919> and<00:06:53.249> it

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:53.399 
the the deck feels really soft and it

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.079 
the the deck feels really soft and it
definitely<00:06:53.639> adds<00:06:53.879> to<00:06:54.599> the<00:06:55.050> overall<00:06:56.089> handling

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.089 
definitely adds to the overall handling

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:58.850 
definitely adds to the overall handling
of<00:06:57.240> the<00:06:57.360> deck<00:06:57.539> it<00:06:57.839> looks<00:06:58.050> really<00:06:58.379> nice<00:06:58.529> and

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
the handling and feel of this deck I

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.040 
the handling and feel of this deck I
