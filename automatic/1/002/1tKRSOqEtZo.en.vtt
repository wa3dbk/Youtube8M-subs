that<00:02:38.790> lava<00:02:39.030> hounds<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.390> changed<00:02:39.750> something

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that lava hounds have changed something

that lava hounds have changed something
in<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> game<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.890> think<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.250> other<00:02:41.370> hounds

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
in the game I think what other hounds

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.980 
in the game I think what other hounds
are<00:02:41.640> actually<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> pretty<00:02:42.300> important<00:02:42.750> troop

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
are actually a pretty important troop

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.080 
are actually a pretty important troop
looking<00:02:43.380> back<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:44.280> really<00:02:44.580> made<00:02:44.850> air

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
looking back they really made air

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.970 
looking back they really made air
attacks<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.690> lot<00:02:45.840> more<00:02:45.990> diversified<00:02:46.560> because

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
attacks a lot more diversified because

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530 
attacks a lot more diversified because
usually<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.520> was<00:02:47.580> just<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.880> math<00:02:48.090> dragons

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
usually it was just like math dragons

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
usually it was just like math dragons
maybe<00:02:48.750> balloon<00:02:49.110> minion<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.920> now<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.220> lot

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
maybe balloon minion but now with a lot

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.890 
maybe balloon minion but now with a lot
of<00:02:50.460> hounds<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:50.940> switch<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.480> lot<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
of hounds you can switch it up a lot the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.630 
of hounds you can switch it up a lot the
lava<00:02:52.110> hounds<00:02:52.410> are<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> golem<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
lava hounds are like a golem for the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.000 
lava hounds are like a golem for the
ground<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.420> lava<00:02:54.600> hounds<00:02:54.959> they<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.800> be

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
ground so the lava hounds they can be

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.800 
ground so the lava hounds they can be
used<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:56.430> dragons<00:02:56.970> they<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.270> be<00:02:57.510> used<00:02:57.720> with

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
used with dragons they can be used with

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.180 
used with dragons they can be used with
balloons<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.740> used<00:02:58.830> with<00:02:58.950> minions

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
balloons that can be used with minions

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.140 
balloons that can be used with minions
you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.580> use<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> ton<00:02:59.940> of<00:02:59.970> different

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you can use a ton of different

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.790 
you can use a ton of different
strategies<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:00.870> them<00:03:00.990> some<00:03:01.440> people<00:03:01.680> even

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
strategies with them some people even

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.280 
strategies with them some people even
use<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.190> golems<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.910> hog<00:03:03.660> riders<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.170> don't

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
use like golems and hog riders I don't

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.449 
use like golems and hog riders I don't
think<00:03:04.410> hog<00:03:04.530> riders<00:03:04.830> really<00:03:05.040> work<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.310> well

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
think hog riders really work that well

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.400 
think hog riders really work that well
but<00:03:05.640> some<00:03:05.820> hog<00:03:06.000> riders<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.230> bunch

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
but some hog riders and there's a bunch

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.930 
but some hog riders and there's a bunch
of<00:03:07.530> crazy<00:03:07.770> things<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.190> can<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.340> used<00:03:08.640> with<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
of crazy things that can be used with a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.430 
of crazy things that can be used with a
lot<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.240> hounds<00:03:09.630> as<00:03:09.720> well<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.110> can<00:03:10.200> switch

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
lot of hounds as well as you can switch

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.020 
lot of hounds as well as you can switch
around<00:03:10.560> how<00:03:10.830> many<00:03:10.980> lava<00:03:11.160> how<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.580> use<00:03:11.820> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
around how many lava how do you use and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.940 
around how many lava how do you use and
its<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.750> brought<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.050> lot<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.320> variety<00:03:13.800> to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
its really brought a lot of variety to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
its really brought a lot of variety to
air<00:03:14.100> attacks<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.850> think<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.150> changed<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.480> lot

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
air attacks so I think it changed a lot

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.970 
air attacks so I think it changed a lot
and<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.200> think<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.470> definitely<00:03:16.830> for<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
and I think it's definitely for the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.380 
and I think it's definitely for the
better<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.430> now<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.850> not<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.180> people

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
better and now it's not just people

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.120 
better and now it's not just people
spamming<00:03:18.600> ground<00:03:18.989> attacks<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.800> can<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
spamming ground attacks you can have the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.680 
spamming ground attacks you can have the
same<00:03:20.310> amount<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.670> success<00:03:20.850> being<00:03:21.269> able<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.600> get

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
same amount of success being able to get

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.300 
same amount of success being able to get
two<00:03:21.900> or<00:03:22.019> three<00:03:22.170> stars<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.560> air<00:03:22.769> attacks<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
two or three stars with air attacks and
