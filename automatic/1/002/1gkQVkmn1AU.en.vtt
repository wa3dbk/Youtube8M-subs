00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 and I talk like one here too 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.279
 impatient waterfall but that is 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.109
 just stop part of the format like that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.220
 just think it's really me 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.130
 personally, I just really enjoy it 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.820
 on it very funny idea and therefore 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.820
 it is done 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.369
 Good day to you and we are coming to you 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.689
 impatiently a new format which the 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.009
 format is now explained to us 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.140
 Just play normal game modes 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.410
 such as survival games and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.310
 will try as soon as possible 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.949
 to finish a round 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.239
 that means we do not attack everything 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.800
 niet and nagelfest is we fight only 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.180
 and where we are currently waiting but 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.930
 provided that the possibility still exists because 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 attack 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.710
 we will also become natural 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.640
 not now if our opponents 1 who 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.870
 then become like a wooden sword 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.540
 Of course not to run on the opponent 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.430
 and totally brings the stupid action 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.019
 but of course we will always be the one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.180
 situation okay now, of course, right 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.430
 well from this the situation accordingly 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.960
 act 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.489
 but it's mainly about it 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.260
 slaughter everyone as fast as possible 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.250
 So it works in this game mode like 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.689
 It's not just about winning 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.239
 but is also fast profit 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:09.799
 and here is our first our first 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.590
 Battle victims and the high as well 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.880
 directly the killer player 66 and us 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.020
 Just hope so fast really 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.189
 a compass get the compass 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.350
 Recently, the very play still avert 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.490
 to next opponents immediately go-out a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.409
 Kompass is finally what we are in 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.929
 impatient always have the fastest 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.479
 want and for that some more 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.219
 perfect with first what the type of without 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.079
 Armor is there that can be similar 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.450
 become dangerous because of that and first 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:38.030
 now this one 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 Halo is because he comes from behind you 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.850
 are the next or come one too 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.469
 of course now is the one with a sword 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.060
 situation has started and run away 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.640
 okay who of them is in the team 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.630
 And who is the type, China is behind 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.100
 we're okay with him we have one 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.320
 arrow we have been and three parts 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 ok, unfortunately, not enough heart around 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.630
 the types here so fast too 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.450
 defeat 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.979
 but who have it directly 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.509
 then it should be possible 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.410
 even a short on a right 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.180
 moment ok now we go on now 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.260
 we go on it as there it returns 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.239
 also expects that we will now 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.330
 come 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.470
 he knows what's going on in any case 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.940
 a little better armor would be natural 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.410
 still very nice, yes, a little bit 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.000
 better equip for the brand new 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.709
 but that's all right 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.470
 most important is as I said I find 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.730
 first a compass or have good 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.290
 ghosts last so and pants and better 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.450
 helm and then it goes on directly 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.800
 because we just have no patience we 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.750
 are impatient people here who that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.410
 format is too stressful turns rather 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.610
 from here it goes on and on me 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.080
 just try in these consequences 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.190
 Just make the rounds as short as possible 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.630
 Of course sometimes it can be possible 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.830
 still 20 minutes ahead 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.830
 coming opponents fight 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.269
 but if only five minutes full 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.040
 will be a five-minute sequence 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.019
 and I talk like one too 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.820
 impatient waterfall but that is 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.650
 just stop part of the format like that 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.940
 find that just real all me 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.090
 personally have simply right mood for 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.010
 Funny idea and that's why it is 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.690
 we have not got a compass yet 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.920
 that's why i just go up now 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.850
 suspect where most 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.049
 opponents are to be found 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.459
 I do not want it around here 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.989
 about cross-country skiing and we just kidron 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.500
 search because that's not the sense of 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.480
 formats but opponents are looking for opponents 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.680
 adversary opponent ok i have to do it all best 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.000
 look at walls must find somewhere names 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 ok i see somebody here somewhere 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.560
 but somebody hears 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.500
 there are still 13 players left alive 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.900
 of course switched off as soon as possible 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.800
 I just want to go straight to 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.130
 run next opponent 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.880
 but I can not see right now where are they 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.180
 next opponent 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.920
 if you ever need her men 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:02.150
 Auntie is just that the katy plays 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:07.220
 wow where the vulture is completely adversary 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.690
 this is perfect okay that gave me a go 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.450
 after that one dams the whole already 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:17.060
 on circle yes there's an okay there 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.100
 in front even several are perfect 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.639
 would say in the hot again now 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100
 track 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.840
 As I said so it makes sense here 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.250
 it really works faster and faster 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.080
 then come up with the right next opponent 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.790
 it's just a compass that has no food 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.380
 more so we must at right 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.690
 to find all these enemies quickly 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.840
 To create compass is just from the 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.860
 reason as practical as that would have thought 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.289
 a stone wood 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.500
 but hello 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.160
 OK 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.950
 demba ba will tnt 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.620
 but we're just not the front as 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.750
 is still someone running right here 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.510
 But the team is not a team 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.710
 is experiencing very good times tnt has 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.420
 So a bit away even installed 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.020
 I really need a lot on one 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.810
 stain perfect yes he will about it 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.950
 he is beaten over we have tested 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.850
 all got well and the tenth has 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:22.110
 again all still good he is with ohio 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.330
 from people here the party goes off 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.190
 only last now and still there 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.020
 by the way now gold on 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.220
 taste her right 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.300
 because the guy is going back there 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.310
 of course, now the hard way with 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:43.510
 against us try ok right on it 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:44.650
 hello you there hello I have again 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.550
 Meet age that's right 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.390
 impatient round 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.600
 the people are really like that 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.240
 fly 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.190
 we have to have a little bit more now 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.250
 Of course, it's hard to hit behind 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.540
 the fence of hearty 30 seconds so 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.640
 It was really fast round 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.640
 we are at about six minutes 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.350
 Of course he wants this on 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.010
 dearest all the time around the railing 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.030
 on legal 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.590
 then we do not pick ourselves up in deathmatch 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.850
 he would like to save his life 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.960
 then we'll just have a look 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.780
 time for something else 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800
 lie about 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.190
 here is nothing special but 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.400
 maybe there's a little something 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.530
 After all, tea does not matter 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.230
 impatient and therefore right on it 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.419
 had gone gold forgot bit went 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.790
 get it with this is that 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.669
 team brought 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.590
 okay that think wants the one has only 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.169
 another first with the company 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.210
 gold with the gold we here 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.729
 OK 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.919
 ok that is down and our last opponent 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:55.830
 and burn 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:58.440
 yes I have to say she was one 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:03.900
 impatient round and that was the first 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:05.639
 role that we have said here so the 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.509
 dearest like me 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:11.160
 imagine 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:13.199
 the whole time action and yes I need 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.690
 a place with the theme about cool so 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.860
 I found that really right king of 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.080
 Thirtieth will be the best laws 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.270
 to the train station and on taiwan lies the 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.470
 tt balaban right really cool me

 Hope you liked the round too 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.740
 I hope you are more up for it 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.060
 format if yes shows with the thumb 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.280
 upwards so with a positive 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.470
 evaluation if you say he's impatient for 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.120
 in between really cool if you buck 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.560
 In any case, I also have bock 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.300
 if you have other format to 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.360
 For example, if you're ready open round 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.909
 Bed was in an impatient round trouble 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.419
 in terrine trammell main wants or what 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:45.030
 always 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:48.900
 schwabl in minecraft what 's up here 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.030
 still everything whatever ender games in 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.560
 almost every one can be impatient 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.970
 play it is just about it 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.840
 as fast as possible the opponents 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.690
 slaughter 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.070
 and that's just the principle of 

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.930
 just type in this format below 

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.610
 a bit faster than normal 

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.599
 yes yes it has worked out quite well the first 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.039
 Round then directly again such a 

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.509
 really nice is classic because the 4 

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:07.889
 map that I just really like and like 

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:10.740
 really love a super first 

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:12.120
 follow, I'm always the planned 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.469
 because this is impatient just start there 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:18.440
 too long as it is okay 

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:18.440
 Three people will stay patient until later
