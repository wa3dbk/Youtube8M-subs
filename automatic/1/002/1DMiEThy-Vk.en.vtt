but<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.380> effective<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.950> can

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
but this one it's more effective you can

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.289 
but this one it's more effective you can
use<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> yet<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> thought<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> great

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
use this and yet I thought it's a great

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.960 
use this and yet I thought it's a great
fat<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.380> enter<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> next<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
fat so enter the next one is going to be

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.780 
fat so enter the next one is going to be
why<00:01:12.570> players<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.860> chemistry<00:01:14.250> shells<00:01:14.580> on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
why players have chemistry shells on

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
why players have chemistry shells on
them<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> pack<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.619> have

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
them when you pack them so if you have

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.530 
them when you pack them so if you have
not<00:01:17.189> realized<00:01:17.580> already<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> pack

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
not realized already when you pack

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
not realized already when you pack
certain<00:01:18.990> players<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.619> chemistry

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
certain players they have chemistry

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.859 
certain players they have chemistry
start<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.060> reason<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.689> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
start on them and the reason for this is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.440 
start on them and the reason for this is
they<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.439> had<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> previous<00:01:23.040> inform<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
they have had a previous inform and it's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.820 
they have had a previous inform and it's
not<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.780> every<00:01:25.110> single<00:01:25.259> person<00:01:25.710> that's

having informed otherwise everyone would

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.510 
having informed otherwise everyone would
have<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.509> chem<00:01:27.750> style<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.130> most<00:01:29.310> of

have a chem style but is with most of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.740 
have a chem style but is with most of
them<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.540> daughter

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
them so as you can see if so daughter

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.390 
them so as you can see if so daughter
had<00:01:31.020> had<00:01:31.229> an<00:01:31.350> informed<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.860> here's<00:01:32.280> a

chemistry style so I thought that was

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
chemistry style so I thought that was
pretty<00:01:34.229> interesting<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.759> thing<00:01:35.939> to

and that means players that have not had
it<00:01:55.560> form<00:01:55.890> throughout<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> whole<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.719> fifa

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it form throughout the whole of the fifa

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.499 
it form throughout the whole of the fifa
14<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.430> playing<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.329> well

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
14 but are playing really really well

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.090 
14 but are playing really really well
i'm<00:02:00.689> happy<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:01.140> consistent<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.770> their<00:02:01.860> game

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
i'm happy very consistent in their game

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520 
i'm happy very consistent in their game
so<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> best<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> Golan<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so the best one I think in the Golan is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.889 
so the best one I think in the Golan is
in<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> normal<00:02:05.310> team<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> season<00:02:06.450> Rooney<00:02:06.750> I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in a normal team of the season Rooney I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.869 
in a normal team of the season Rooney I
think<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.649> 90<00:02:08.099> rate<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.489> let<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
think that's 90 rate and let you and

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.180 
think that's 90 rate and let you and
rate<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.840> Civil<00:02:10.200> waves<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.890> Luke

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
rate it and the Civil waves do have Luke

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.800 
rate it and the Civil waves do have Luke
Shaw<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> place<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.150> there

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
Shaw a place like that there

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.540 
Shaw a place like that there
very<00:02:13.050> good<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.099> can<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.400> the

of all the best players in that the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.850 
of all the best players in that the
whole<00:02:39.540> team<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.080> season<00:02:40.410> toast<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.739> made

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
me run over five to 11 weeks I think

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.259 
me run over five to 11 weeks I think
that<00:02:43.860> he<00:02:43.950> was<00:02:44.040> Caesar<00:02:44.340> depending<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.150> they

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
that he was Caesar depending on if they

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.120 
that he was Caesar depending on if they
do<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.450> per<00:02:45.780> week<00:02:46.049> because<00:02:46.230> if<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.680> per<00:02:46.920> week

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
do a per week because if it is per week

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.970 
do a per week because if it is per week
that<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.940> 11<00:02:48.660> weeks<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.620> eight<00:02:49.950> weeks

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that is 11 weeks or eight weeks

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.660 
that is 11 weeks or eight weeks
including<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.120> three<00:02:51.360> consistence<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.340> to

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
including the three consistence so on to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.880 
including the three consistence so on to
another<00:02:54.000> random<00:02:54.480> factor<00:02:54.989> we<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.380> managers

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
another random factor we have managers

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.559 
another random factor we have managers
so<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> manager<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.360> pack

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
so when you get a manager on the pack

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.420 
so when you get a manager on the pack
that<00:02:57.750> don't<00:02:58.080> quit<00:02:58.440> sell<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.980> manager<00:02:59.280> I'm

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that don't quit sell the manager I'm

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.570 
telling you a don't click sell them
leave<00:03:01.260> me<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> club<00:03:01.769> even<00:03:02.099> if<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.280> need<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.459> do

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
leave me a club even if you need to do

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.610 
leave me a club even if you need to do
anything<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.180> leave<00:03:03.660> him<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.049> club<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
anything just leave him in your club and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.920 
anything just leave him in your club and
the<00:03:05.069> reason<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.450> managers

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the reason for this is the managers

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.140 
the reason for this is the managers
increase<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.680> contract<00:03:08.220> percentage<00:03:08.730> rate<00:03:08.940> so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
increase the contract percentage rate so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
increase the contract percentage rate so
if<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.690> contract<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.380> rare<00:03:10.620> gold

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
if you get a contract that's a rare gold

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.910 
if you get a contract that's a rare gold
one<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.340> normally<00:03:11.640> get<00:03:11.760> 28<00:03:12.360> contracts<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
one you normally get 28 contracts but it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.220 
one you normally get 28 contracts but it
automatically<00:03:14.670> says<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:15.360> 28<00:03:15.750> contracts

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230

and<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.799> managers<00:03:17.190> what<00:03:17.459> they<00:03:17.609> do<00:03:17.670> you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and with the managers what they do you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.819 
and with the managers what they do you
can<00:03:18.480> apply<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> manager<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.350> your<00:03:19.470> club<00:03:19.650> if

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you want to that may create efficiency

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.660 
you want to that may create efficiency
