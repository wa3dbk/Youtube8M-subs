out it was over $200 retail I think at

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
out it was over $200 retail I think at
the<00:00:33.030> time<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> got<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.230> $200

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.729 
the time that I got it it was about $200
retail<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.210> I'm<00:00:36.570> focusing<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.290> these<00:00:37.469> two

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
retail so I'm focusing on these two

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.000 
retail so I'm focusing on these two
here's<00:00:38.040> why<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> ascend<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.200> believe<00:00:40.829> it's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here's why the ascend I believe it's

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.380 
here's why the ascend I believe it's
probably<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.579> away<00:00:41.670> sometime<00:00:42.270> in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
probably going to go away sometime in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
probably going to go away sometime in
the<00:00:42.450> next<00:00:42.570> few<00:00:42.690> months<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.770> only<00:00:43.890> reason

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the next few months and the only reason

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
the next few months and the only reason
why<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> say<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.780> 99

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
why I say that is because if this is 99

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.100 
why I say that is because if this is 99
and<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> 79<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.120> ascend<00:00:48.510> hasn't

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and this is 79 and the ascend hasn't

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
and this is 79 and the ascend hasn't
been<00:00:49.230> reduced<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.800> price<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.300> would

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
been reduced in price I would I would

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
been reduced in price I would I would
assume<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.050> they're<00:00:52.559> probably<00:00:52.739> gonna<00:00:52.920> come

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
assume that they're probably gonna come

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.560 
assume that they're probably gonna come
out<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.550> model<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.360> maybe

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
out with a new model of it or maybe

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
out with a new model of it or maybe
they'll<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.809> come<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> brand<00:00:56.010> new

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
they'll just come up with a brand new

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
they'll just come up with a brand new
phone<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.550> maybe<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> replacement

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
phone or maybe this is the replacement

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
phone or maybe this is the replacement
I'm<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.739> sure<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.520> gonna

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I'm really not sure and I'm not gonna

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.420 
I'm really not sure and I'm not gonna
speculate<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.930> let's<00:01:01.649> focus<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.160> these<00:01:02.370> two

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
speculate but let's focus on these two

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.390 
speculate but let's focus on these two
phones<00:01:02.910> okay<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.500> clearly

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
there's a pretty big difference in size

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
there's a pretty big difference in size
I<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.070> said<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> last<00:01:08.670> video<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.030> I

as<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.000> did<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.420> mine<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:15.830> see<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.130> takes<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
as I did on mine you see it takes like a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.930 
as I did on mine you see it takes like a
couple<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.660> seconds<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.670> little

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
couple of seconds or like just a little

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.479 
couple of seconds or like just a little
bit<00:03:21.090> longer<00:03:21.360> for<00:03:22.260> those<00:03:22.380> screens<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:23.070> show<00:03:23.280> up

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
bit longer for those screens to show up

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.330 
bit longer for those screens to show up
so<00:03:23.730> there<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.450> little<00:03:24.959> bit<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.290> delay<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.860> the
