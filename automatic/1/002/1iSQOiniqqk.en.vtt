you a sense of where we are and these
hives<00:00:17.099> there<00:00:18.099> they<00:00:18.279> are<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.600> hive<00:00:19.810> on<00:00:20.020> the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
hives there they are the hive on the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.950 
hives there they are the hive on the
left<00:00:20.440> is<00:00:20.789> full<00:00:21.789> of<00:00:21.970> Italians<00:00:22.630> that<00:00:22.840> we

left is full of Italians that we

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.900 
left is full of Italians that we
introduced<00:00:23.410> as<00:00:23.560> a<00:00:23.590> nucleus<00:00:24.039> colony<00:00:24.490> this<00:00:24.670> past

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
introduced as a nucleus colony this past

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.370 
introduced as a nucleus colony this past
spring<00:00:25.270> in<00:00:26.369> early<00:00:27.369> May<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.930> hive<00:00:29.109> on<00:00:29.289> the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
spring in early May and the hive on the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.369 
spring in early May and the hive on the
left<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:30.789> Russian<00:00:31.150> colony<00:00:31.570> those<00:00:32.199> are

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
left is the Russian colony those are

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.900 
left is the Russian colony those are
Russian<00:00:32.710> bees<00:00:32.859> that<00:00:33.070> we<00:00:33.129> created<00:00:33.399> a<00:00:33.520> nucleus

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
Russian bees that we created a nucleus

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.469 
Russian bees that we created a nucleus
colony<00:00:34.270> out<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.539> with<00:00:34.660> our<00:00:34.890> April<00:00:35.890> fifteenth

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:36.479 
colony out of with our April fifteenth

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.200 
colony out of with our April fifteenth
our<00:00:37.479> April<00:00:37.809> fifteenth<00:00:39.030> installations<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.149> we

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
our April fifteenth installations and we

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.040 
our April fifteenth installations and we
brought<00:00:40.899> them<00:00:40.960> up<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:44.819> early<00:00:45.819> may<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.089> well<00:00:46.269> so

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
brought them up in early may as well so

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.660 
brought them up in early may as well so
both<00:00:47.229> colonies<00:00:47.679> are<00:00:47.799> thriving<00:00:48.039> but<00:00:48.399> I<00:00:48.429> think

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
both colonies are thriving but I think

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.950 
both colonies are thriving but I think
we've<00:00:48.789> got<00:00:48.940> some<00:00:49.120> real<00:00:49.269> harvestable<00:00:49.690> honey

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
we've got some real harvestable honey

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.959 
we've got some real harvestable honey
out<00:00:50.139> of<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.460> Italian<00:00:51.460> high<00:00:51.549> but<00:00:51.760> we're<00:00:51.879> going

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
out of the Italian high but we're going

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.939 
out of the Italian high but we're going
to<00:00:52.030> try<00:00:52.089> to<00:00:52.269> pull<00:00:53.019> a<00:00:53.049> couple<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.469> frames<00:00:53.679> and

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
to try to pull a couple of frames and

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.419 
to try to pull a couple of frames and
make<00:00:54.069> a<00:00:54.100> couple<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:54.940> quarts<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.829> our<00:00:56.949> access<00:00:57.280> to

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
make a couple of quarts so our access to

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:58.860 
make a couple of quarts so our access to
these<00:00:57.549> hives<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:57.999> little<00:00:58.299> difficult<00:00:58.479> we

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
these hives is a little difficult we

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.619 
these hives is a little difficult we
have<00:00:58.959> to<00:00:59.079> go<00:00:59.170> through<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.559> window<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.629> then

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
have to go through this window and then

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.960 
have to go through this window and then
they<00:01:01.719> sit<00:01:01.929> on<00:01:01.959> this<00:01:02.199> flat<00:01:02.469> roof<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.790> least

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
they sit on this flat roof and at least

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.010 
they sit on this flat roof and at least
there<00:01:07.120> in<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.300> shade<00:01:07.480> right<00:01:07.690> now<00:01:07.840> hopefully

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
there in the shade right now hopefully

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.120 
there in the shade right now hopefully
they'll<00:01:08.230> be<00:01:08.260> a<00:01:08.350> little<00:01:08.560> calm<00:01:08.740> these<00:01:08.980> are<00:01:09.070> the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
they'll be a little calm these are the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.280 
they'll be a little calm these are the
hives<00:01:09.310> that<00:01:09.670> ping<00:01:10.270> me<00:01:10.480> a<00:01:10.510> few<00:01:10.810> times<00:01:10.960> last

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.980

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
Birmingham then I've got this bucket

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.850 
Birmingham then I've got this bucket
here<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.290> clean<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:23.380> had<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.620> paint

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
here that I clean we had this paint

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
here that I clean we had this paint
scraper<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.880> we're<00:02:25.030> using<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.630> scrape<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
scraper that we're using to scrape the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:37.170 
scraper that we're using to scrape the
wax<00:02:26.470> off<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.220> plastic<00:02:27.640> foundation<00:02:36.180> you're

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
wax off the plastic foundation you're

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.060 
wax off the plastic foundation you're
getting<00:02:37.390> inside<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:37.990> head<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.010> it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
getting inside it to the head and so it

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.260 
getting inside it to the head and so it
comes<00:02:42.250> off<00:02:42.430> really<00:02:42.580> easily<00:02:42.820> that's<00:02:43.120> why<00:02:43.240> I

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
comes off really easily that's why I

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.890 
comes off really easily that's why I
like<00:02:43.360> these<00:02:43.750> platies<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:45.270> these<00:02:46.270> frames<00:02:46.570> with

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
like these platies of these frames with

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.110 
like these platies of these frames with
the<00:02:47.020> plastic<00:02:47.200> foundation<00:02:47.890> just<00:02:48.760> scrapes

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the plastic foundation just scrapes

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.640 
the plastic foundation just scrapes
right<00:02:49.330> off<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.660> we<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:49.930> pop<00:02:50.170> these<00:02:50.350> frames

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
right off and we just pop these frames

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.010 
right off and we just pop these frames
right<00:02:50.860> back<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.270> hive<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.750> hopefully

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
right back in to the hive and hopefully

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.980 
right back in to the hive and hopefully
they<00:02:53.140> will<00:02:53.260> build<00:02:53.440> them<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.650> again<00:02:54.990> certainly

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
they will build them out again certainly

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.210 
they will build them out again certainly
they<00:02:56.080> will<00:02:56.230> strip<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.590> honey<00:02:56.830> off<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.100> them

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
they will strip the honey off of them

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:19.190 
they will strip the honey off of them
and<00:02:57.580> redeposit<00:02:58.480> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.930

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
and what you end up with Madeleine why

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.920 
and what you end up with Madeleine why
don't<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.150> put<00:03:22.240> that<00:03:22.300> in<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.780> end

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
don't you put that in there what you end

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.770 
don't you put that in there what you end
up<00:03:23.020> with<00:03:23.080> after<00:03:23.350> three<00:03:23.800> frames<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.780> three

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
up with after three frames of three

up with after three frames of three
medium<00:03:26.110> frames<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:29.250> honey<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.460> a<00:03:30.540> big<00:03:31.540> mess<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
medium frames of honey is a big mess of

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.180 
medium frames of honey is a big mess of
wax<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:33.270> liquid<00:03:34.270> that<00:03:34.570> we<00:03:34.750> will<00:03:34.990> then<00:03:35.190> process

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
wax and liquid that we will then process

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.930 
wax and liquid that we will then process
with<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> crushing<00:03:36.940> strain<00:03:37.240> method<00:03:41.940> so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
with the crushing strain method so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.699 
with the crushing strain method so
Maddie<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.360> in<00:03:43.510> there<00:03:43.690> with<00:03:43.840> her<00:03:43.959> clean<00:03:44.260> hands

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
about stirring Maddie it's about

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.940 
about stirring Maddie it's about
crushing<00:03:48.760> right<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:50.350> just<00:03:50.560> keep<00:03:50.709> crushing

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950

what you're trying to do is crush all

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.500 
what you're trying to do is crush all
the<00:03:53.080> cells<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:54.070> hold<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.910> whack<00:03:55.120> I'll<00:03:55.360> have

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the cells that hold the whack I'll have

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.870 
the cells that hold the whack I'll have
that<00:03:55.540> hold<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> honey<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.340> gets<00:03:57.489> released

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
that hold the honey so it gets released

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.330 
that hold the honey so it gets released
and<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.420> oh<00:03:58.600> don't<00:03:59.260> do<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.440> just<00:04:00.070> leave<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.220> in

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
there I was thinking you could use that

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.570 
there I was thinking you could use that
tell<00:04:05.050> break<00:04:05.260> stuff<00:04:05.470> up<00:04:05.680> but<00:04:05.800> I<00:04:05.890> don't<00:04:06.010> look<00:04:06.459> you

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
tell break stuff up but I don't look you

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.520 
tell break stuff up but I don't look you
need<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.760> do<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:08.020> Greg<00:04:08.230> could<00:04:08.380> keep

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
need to do that so Greg could keep

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.330 
need to do that so Greg could keep
breaking<00:04:08.800> up<00:04:08.860> into<00:04:08.980> small<00:04:09.160> pieces<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:11.340> then

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
breaking up into small pieces and then

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.620 
breaking up into small pieces and then
what<00:04:12.459> we'll<00:04:12.550> do<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.880> we'll<00:04:13.000> strain<00:04:13.390> out<00:04:13.600> the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
what we'll do is we'll strain out the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.140 
what we'll do is we'll strain out the
wax<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:14.670> what<00:04:15.670> we<00:04:15.790> left<00:04:15.970> with<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.530> delicious

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
wax and what we left with is delicious

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.610 
wax and what we left with is delicious

setup wait so that's where you did it

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.570 
setup wait so that's where you did it
that's<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.710> bucket<00:04:56.979> in<00:04:57.070> which<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.310> did<00:04:57.460> that

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
that's the bucket in which you did that

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.920 
that's the bucket in which you did that
the<00:04:57.729> crushing<00:04:58.000> you're<00:04:58.390> crushing<00:04:58.600> with<00:04:58.810> your

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
the crushing you're crushing with your

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.680 
the crushing you're crushing with your
hand<00:04:59.110> right<00:04:59.290> what's<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.160> bucket<00:05:00.430> below

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.180 

colander<00:05:04.690> type<00:05:04.960> thing<00:05:05.290> so

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
colander type thing so

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.850 
colander type thing so
the<00:05:07.520> honey<00:05:07.730> will<00:05:07.910> drip<00:05:08.180> through<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:09.080> through

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
the honey will drip through and through

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.100 
the honey will drip through and through
the<00:05:10.040> holes<00:05:10.670> that<00:05:10.940> are<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.270> bottom<00:05:11.450> so<00:05:11.960> is

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
the holes that are in the bottom so is

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.820 
the holes that are in the bottom so is
sort<00:05:12.260> of<00:05:12.290> our<00:05:12.410> primary<00:05:12.680> strainer<00:05:13.190> right<00:05:13.460> and

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
sort of our primary strainer right and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.340 
sort of our primary strainer right and
there<00:05:15.830> is<00:05:16.010> another<00:05:16.160> colander<00:05:16.820> right<00:05:17.120> here<00:05:17.540> so

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
there is another colander right here so

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.340 
there is another colander right here so
just<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.980> get<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.370> little<00:05:19.460> bit<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:20.230> then<00:05:21.230> this

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
just to get a little bit and then this

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.440 
just to get a little bit and then this
is<00:05:21.500> where<00:05:21.650> all<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.800> honey<00:05:22.070> will<00:05:22.220> end<00:05:22.400> up<00:05:22.520> great

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
is where all the honey will end up great

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.920 
is where all the honey will end up great
so<00:05:23.960> let's<00:05:24.080> see<00:05:24.290> how<00:05:24.320> much<00:05:24.530> we<00:05:28.000> so<00:05:29.000> what<00:05:29.870> you

so let's see how much we so what you

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.910 
so let's see how much we so what you
need<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.140> know<00:05:30.170> is<00:05:30.410> this<00:05:30.470> is<00:05:30.590> going<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.770> take

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
need to know is this is going to take

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.990 
need to know is this is going to take
out<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:31.190> process<00:05:31.400> is<00:05:31.640> going<00:05:31.730> to<00:05:31.820> take<00:05:31.970> a

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
out this process is going to take a

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.290 
out this process is going to take a
while<00:05:32.120> because<00:05:32.390> honey<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:32.810> thick<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:35.120> we

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
while because honey is thick and so we

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.850 
while because honey is thick and so we
just<00:05:35.450> let<00:05:35.570> this<00:05:35.630> sit<00:05:35.930> like<00:05:36.350> this<00:05:36.380> for<00:05:36.680> a<00:05:36.740> little

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
just let this sit like this for a little

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.450 
just let this sit like this for a little
while<00:05:37.040> while<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:38.230> wax<00:05:39.230> drains<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.310> honey

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
while while the wax drains and honey

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.070 
while while the wax drains and honey
drains<00:05:40.730> out<00:05:40.880> of<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:42.400> so<00:05:43.400> after<00:05:43.780> crushing<00:05:44.780> this

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
drains out of it so after crushing this

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.500 
drains out of it so after crushing this
through<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.350> primary<00:05:45.970> trainer<00:05:46.970> that<00:05:47.390> we've

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
through the primary trainer that we've

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.050 
through the primary trainer that we've
built<00:05:47.720> and<00:05:48.020> then<00:05:48.590> this<00:05:48.770> colander<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.910> have

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
built and then this colander you have

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.670 
built and then this colander you have
what<00:05:50.180> looks<00:05:50.210> like<00:05:50.450> porridge<00:05:51.110> here<00:05:51.350> which<00:05:51.530> is

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
what looks like porridge here which is

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.190 
what looks like porridge here which is
essentially<00:05:52.190> just<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.330> last<00:05:53.540> bits<00:05:53.840> of<00:05:53.960> wax

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
essentially just the last bits of wax

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.290 
essentially just the last bits of wax
what<00:05:54.920> we'll<00:05:55.040> do<00:05:55.160> is<00:05:55.310> we'll<00:05:55.430> take<00:05:55.610> this<00:05:55.760> wax<00:05:56.030> out

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
what we'll do is we'll take this wax out

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.590 
what we'll do is we'll take this wax out
put<00:05:56.510> it<00:05:56.600> on<00:05:56.690> a<00:05:57.010> on<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.070> sheet<00:05:58.490> pan<00:05:58.700> and<00:05:58.940> then<00:05:59.300> put

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
put it on a on a sheet pan and then put

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.870 
put it on a on a sheet pan and then put
it<00:05:59.690> near<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.870> hide<00:06:00.110> and<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.380> bees<00:06:00.590> will<00:06:00.880> pick

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
it near the hide and the bees will pick

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.240 
it near the hide and the bees will pick
away<00:06:02.090> all<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.360> honey<00:06:02.540> so<00:06:02.840> that's<00:06:03.020> good<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.470> no

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
away all the honey so that's good and no

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.080 
away all the honey so that's good and no
redeposited<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.150> then<00:06:05.960> we've<00:06:06.140> got<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:07.090> rather

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
redeposited and then we've got a rather

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.960 
redeposited and then we've got a rather
large<00:06:08.390> bowl<00:06:08.840> full<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.230> honey<00:06:09.730> which<00:06:10.730> we<00:06:10.850> don't

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
large bowl full of honey which we don't

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.180 
large bowl full of honey which we don't
know<00:06:11.120> how<00:06:11.210> much<00:06:11.360> we<00:06:11.540> have<00:06:11.720> yet<00:06:12.070> but<00:06:13.070> we're

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
know how much we have yet but we're

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.590 
know how much we have yet but we're
going<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.370> do<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.580> we're<00:06:13.700> stranded<00:06:14.030> as<00:06:14.270> we<00:06:14.360> pour

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
going to do is we're stranded as we pour

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.900 
going to do is we're stranded as we pour
it<00:06:14.660> into<00:06:14.750> bottles<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.320> we'll<00:06:16.280> know<00:06:16.550> then<00:06:16.880> how

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
it into bottles and we'll know then how

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.550 
it into bottles and we'll know then how
many<00:06:18.640> pints<00:06:19.640> of<00:06:20.140> hunting<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.230> get<00:06:21.380> out<00:06:21.530> of

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
many pints of hunting to get out of

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.380 
many pints of hunting to get out of
three<00:06:22.130> medium<00:06:22.580> frames<00:06:24.970> so<00:06:25.970> now<00:06:26.090> we're<00:06:26.240> taking

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
three medium frames so now we're taking

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.650 
three medium frames so now we're taking
the<00:06:27.820> primarily<00:06:28.820> filter<00:06:29.180> honey<00:06:29.360> and<00:06:29.540> we're

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
the primarily filter honey and we're

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.659 
the primarily filter honey and we're
pouring<00:06:29.930> it<00:06:29.990> through<00:06:30.200> us<00:06:30.350> another<00:06:31.070> sieve<00:06:31.400> into

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
pouring it through us another sieve into

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.870 
pouring it through us another sieve into
these<00:06:32.419> pint<00:06:32.690> jars<00:06:32.960> these<00:06:33.800> are<00:06:33.919> pint-sized

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
these pint jars these are pint-sized

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.780 
these pint jars these are pint-sized
mason<00:06:35.360> jar<00:06:35.540> ball<00:06:36.500> jars<00:06:36.770> and<00:06:37.370> we're<00:06:37.610> going<00:06:37.730> to

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
mason jar ball jars and we're going to

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.130 
mason jar ball jars and we're going to
see<00:06:37.910> how<00:06:38.060> many<00:06:38.120> as<00:06:38.390> we<00:06:38.510> get<00:06:38.660> it's<00:06:38.930> been<00:06:39.110> a

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
see how many as we get it's been a

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.520 
see how many as we get it's been a
little<00:06:39.290> messy<00:06:39.650> here<00:06:39.830> but<00:06:40.070> that's<00:06:40.220> okay<00:06:41.530> sigh

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
little messy here but that's okay sigh

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.690 
little messy here but that's okay sigh
Maddie<00:06:42.710> how<00:06:42.860> long<00:06:42.980> did<00:06:43.100> this<00:06:43.190> tape<00:06:43.430> would<00:06:43.580> you

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
Maddie how long did this tape would you

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.570 
Maddie how long did this tape would you
guess<00:06:47.800> right<00:06:48.800> because<00:06:49.040> it<00:06:49.130> mean<00:06:49.310> we<00:06:49.430> didn't

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
guess right because it mean we didn't

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.159 
guess right because it mean we didn't
have<00:06:49.669> to<00:06:49.760> do<00:06:49.850> a<00:06:49.880> lot<00:06:50.030> of<00:06:50.060> waiting<00:06:50.510> but<00:06:51.080> it

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
have to do a lot of waiting but it

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.570 
have to do a lot of waiting but it
didn't<00:06:51.350> require<00:06:51.560> a<00:06:51.680> lot<00:06:51.890> of<00:06:51.919> work<00:06:52.190> on<00:06:52.280> our<00:06:52.370> part

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
didn't require a lot of work on our part

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.920 
didn't require a lot of work on our part
and<00:06:53.270> did<00:06:53.570> we<00:06:53.690> get<00:06:53.810> stung<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:55.660> did<00:06:56.660> but<00:06:56.780> that<00:06:56.810> was

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
and did we get stung I did but that was

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.440 
and did we get stung I did but that was
just<00:06:57.020> cuz<00:06:57.230> when<00:06:57.380> I<00:06:57.410> was<00:06:57.620> harvesting<00:06:58.040> the<00:06:58.130> bees

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
just cuz when I was harvesting the bees

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.820 
just cuz when I was harvesting the bees
otherwise<00:06:59.450> its<00:06:59.780> members<00:07:00.470> pretty<00:07:00.680> harmless

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
otherwise its members pretty harmless

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.880 
otherwise its members pretty harmless
okay<00:07:01.100> so<00:07:01.280> from<00:07:01.640> three<00:07:02.060> medium<00:07:02.660> frames<00:07:02.990> how

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
okay so from three medium frames how

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.650 
okay so from three medium frames how
much<00:07:04.130> money<00:07:04.610> did<00:07:04.880> we<00:07:04.940> get<00:07:05.210> at<00:07:05.360> the<00:07:05.450> end<00:07:05.540> of<00:07:05.570> the

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
much money did we get at the end of the

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.879 
much money did we get at the end of the
day<00:07:08.050> these<00:07:09.050> jars<00:07:09.320> are<00:07:09.470> how<00:07:09.590> big

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.250 

that's<00:07:13.889> right<00:07:14.040> so<00:07:14.280> they're<00:07:14.430> pint-sized<00:07:14.850> jars

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
that's right so they're pint-sized jars

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.780 
that's right so they're pint-sized jars
so<00:07:16.260> roughly<00:07:17.360> each<00:07:18.360> frame<00:07:19.610> provided<00:07:20.610> us<00:07:20.760> with

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
so roughly each frame provided us with

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.190 
so roughly each frame provided us with
two<00:07:21.570> pints<00:07:22.820> or<00:07:23.820> one<00:07:24.150> quart<00:07:24.510> the<00:07:24.810> equivalent

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
two pints or one quart the equivalent

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.030 
two pints or one quart the equivalent
one<00:07:25.320> quart<00:07:25.590> of<00:07:26.060> honey<00:07:27.060> and<00:07:27.770> that's<00:07:28.770> a<00:07:28.860> pretty

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
one quart of honey and that's a pretty

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.040 
one quart of honey and that's a pretty
nice<00:07:29.220> harvest<00:07:29.460> for<00:07:29.820> just<00:07:30.090> a<00:07:30.210> few<00:07:30.570> minutes<00:07:30.690> work

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
nice harvest for just a few minutes work

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.170 
nice harvest for just a few minutes work
on<00:07:31.650> our<00:07:31.800> part<00:07:32.040> a<00:07:32.220> lot<00:07:32.400> of<00:07:32.550> work<00:07:32.669> on<00:07:32.790> the<00:07:32.910> part<00:07:33.150> of

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
on our part a lot of work on the part of

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.480 
on our part a lot of work on the part of
the<00:07:33.270> bees<00:07:33.530> but<00:07:34.530> I<00:07:34.590> think<00:07:34.860> that<00:07:34.919> this<00:07:35.160> proves

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
the bees but I think that this proves

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.040 
the bees but I think that this proves
out<00:07:35.669> the<00:07:35.790> crushing<00:07:36.000> strain<00:07:36.330> method<00:07:36.720> is<00:07:36.840> pretty

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
out the crushing strain method is pretty

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.480 
out the crushing strain method is pretty
easy<00:07:37.260> to<00:07:37.440> do<00:07:37.560> and<00:07:37.740> pretty<00:07:37.950> cheap<00:07:38.160> I<00:07:40.370> would<00:07:41.370> like

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490 
easy to do and pretty cheap I would like

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.340 
easy to do and pretty cheap I would like
to<00:07:41.610> get<00:07:41.730> an<00:07:41.820> extractor<00:07:42.300> at<00:07:42.389> some<00:07:42.600> point<00:07:42.840> but<00:07:43.080> in

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.350 
to get an extractor at some point but in

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.659 
to get an extractor at some point but in
the<00:07:43.500> interim<00:07:43.889> this<00:07:44.130> seems<00:07:44.310> like<00:07:44.400> a<00:07:44.490> pretty

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
the interim this seems like a pretty

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.370 
the interim this seems like a pretty
effective<00:07:44.820> way<00:07:45.210> of<00:07:45.240> doing<00:07:45.570> it<00:07:45.690> and<00:07:46.169> if<00:07:46.290> you

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 
effective way of doing it and if you

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.110 
effective way of doing it and if you
look<00:07:46.530> at<00:07:46.620> our<00:07:46.680> honey<00:07:46.860> to<00:07:47.100> you'll<00:07:47.340> see<00:07:47.580> that<00:07:47.850> it

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
look at our honey to you'll see that it

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.600 
look at our honey to you'll see that it
is<00:07:48.150> it<00:07:48.930> looks<00:07:49.110> a<00:07:49.200> little<00:07:49.350> cloudy<00:07:49.620> and<00:07:49.950> that's

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610 
is it looks a little cloudy and that's

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.820 
is it looks a little cloudy and that's
because<00:07:50.850> we<00:07:51.360> did<00:07:51.510> not<00:07:51.540> filter<00:07:52.229> it<00:07:52.380> all<00:07:52.530> we<00:07:52.680> did

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830 
because we did not filter it all we did

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.700 
because we did not filter it all we did
with<00:07:53.010> strain<00:07:53.370> it<00:07:53.520> and<00:07:53.550> so<00:07:54.360> there<00:07:54.570> are<00:07:54.720> lots<00:07:55.590> of

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710 
with strain it and so there are lots of

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.190 
with strain it and so there are lots of
nutrients<00:07:56.190> in<00:07:56.340> it<00:07:56.430> like<00:07:56.580> pollen<00:07:57.090> and<00:07:57.270> a<00:07:57.960> little

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.200 
nutrients in it like pollen and a little

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.780 
nutrients in it like pollen and a little
bit<00:07:58.260> of<00:07:58.320> beeswax<00:07:58.800> but<00:07:59.190> it<00:07:59.340> still<00:07:59.550> tastes

00:07:59.780 --> 00:07:59.790 
bit of beeswax but it still tastes

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.350 
bit of beeswax but it still tastes
terrific<00:08:01.370> and<00:08:02.370> that's<00:08:02.700> what<00:08:02.910> we<00:08:03.030> need<00:08:03.180> to<00:08:03.240> do

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 
terrific and that's what we need to do

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.830 
terrific and that's what we need to do
for<00:08:04.290> crushing<00:08:04.530> strain<00:08:05.630> thanks<00:08:06.630> very<00:08:06.780> much

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 
for crushing strain thanks very much

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.200 
for crushing strain thanks very much
