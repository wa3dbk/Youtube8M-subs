00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
less separate here there will start

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.340 
less separate here there will start
together<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.990> mean<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.259> the

together for like I mean that do the
same<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> move<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> sides

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
same there now I move on to the sides

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.219

and<00:01:27.659> cars<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.930> wheels

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and cars you can see here the wheels

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
and cars you can see here the wheels
under<00:01:32.189> their<00:01:32.640> fix<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> axle<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.810> they

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
under their fix on the axle so they

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.580 
under their fix on the axle so they
can't<00:01:34.200> turn<00:01:34.909> one's<00:01:35.909> health<00:01:36.439> whereas<00:01:37.439> they
