you

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.799 

I<00:00:30.130> guess<00:00:31.130> ever<00:00:31.369> since<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.699> was<00:00:31.820> little<00:00:31.849> like<00:00:32.059> was

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
I guess ever since I was little like was

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.900 
I guess ever since I was little like was
drawing<00:00:33.140> it<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.469> just<00:00:33.649> drew<00:00:33.980> like<00:00:34.190> people<00:00:34.579> and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
drawing it I just drew like people and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.520 
drawing it I just drew like people and
cats<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.129> houses<00:00:37.129> I<00:00:37.370> don't<00:00:37.640> know<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:38.090> was

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
cats and houses I don't know it was

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.430 
cats and houses I don't know it was
little<00:00:39.530> kid<00:00:39.980> things<00:00:40.280> but<00:00:40.790> um<00:00:41.019> as<00:00:42.019> I<00:00:42.170> started

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
little kid things but um as I started

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.139 
little kid things but um as I started
getting<00:00:42.589> better<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:42.829> I<00:00:43.250> was<00:00:43.519> interested<00:00:43.850> in<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
getting better I I was interested in the

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.110 
getting better I I was interested in the
figure<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.920> all<00:00:46.159> my<00:00:46.280> free<00:00:46.489> time<00:00:46.519> drawings<00:00:47.000> are

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
figure so all my free time drawings are

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.020 
figure so all my free time drawings are
all<00:00:47.180> figural<00:00:47.600> drawings<00:00:48.519> no<00:00:49.519> specific<00:00:49.940> reason

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
all figural drawings no specific reason

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.479 
all figural drawings no specific reason
I<00:00:50.300> guess<00:00:50.659> just<00:00:50.989> because<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.680> think<00:00:51.979> they're

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
I guess just because I think they're

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.649 
I guess just because I think they're
more<00:00:52.610> interesting<00:00:53.000> than<00:00:53.149> a<00:00:53.180> bowl<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.510> fruit

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
more interesting than a bowl of fruit

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.999 
more interesting than a bowl of fruit
maybe<00:00:54.309> or<00:00:55.899> something<00:00:56.899> like<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.050> I<00:01:00.009> started

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:01.009 
maybe or something like that I started

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.280 
maybe or something like that I started
drawing<00:01:01.309> on<00:01:01.960> coloring<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.049> finding

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
drawing on coloring and finding

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.200 
drawing on coloring and finding
different<00:01:03.320> ways<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.680> incorporate<00:01:04.610> color<00:01:05.119> into

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
different ways to incorporate color into

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.940 
different ways to incorporate color into
my<00:01:05.479> drawings<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:06.110> then<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.409> found<00:01:06.619> out<00:01:06.799> that<00:01:06.890> I

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
my drawings but then I found out that I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.770 
my drawings but then I found out that I
like<00:01:07.159> painting<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.580> best<00:01:07.759> gives<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.659> more

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
like painting the best gives you more

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.160 
like painting the best gives you more
flexibility<00:01:09.350> as<00:01:09.560> far<00:01:09.619> as<00:01:09.979> moving<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.340> medium

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
flexibility as far as moving the medium

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.770 
flexibility as far as moving the medium
you<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:12.200> more<00:01:12.619> range<00:01:12.829> of<00:01:12.950> color<00:01:13.189> light<00:01:14.119> you

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
you have more range of color light you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.760 
you have more range of color light you
can<00:01:14.960> manipulate<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:15.650> better<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:16.880> chose

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
can manipulate it better so I chose

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.289 
can manipulate it better so I chose
acrylic<00:01:18.770> because<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.189> dries<00:01:19.400> fast<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.000> it

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
acrylic because it dries fast and it

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.840 
acrylic because it dries fast and it
works<00:01:20.600> how<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:21.320> need<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.710> work<00:01:21.829> well<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.549> was

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
works how I need to work well I was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.639 
works how I need to work well I was
trying<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.240> integrate<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:24.110> same<00:01:24.290> colors<00:01:24.560> I

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
trying to integrate the same colors I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.139 
trying to integrate the same colors I
was<00:01:24.799> using<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.130> figure<00:01:25.430> with<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.640> background

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
was using the figure with the background

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.240 
was using the figure with the background
and<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.750> would<00:01:26.869> just<00:01:27.049> pick<00:01:27.229> one<00:01:27.500> aspect<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.100> that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
and I would just pick one aspect of that

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.790 
and I would just pick one aspect of that
and<00:01:28.520> highlight<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.960> make<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.229> overpowering

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
and highlight it to make it overpowering

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.770 
and highlight it to make it overpowering
almost<00:01:31.130> but<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.670> still<00:01:31.940> wanted<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.510> be<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
almost but I still wanted it to be the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.149 
almost but I still wanted it to be the
same<00:01:32.960> colors<00:01:33.260> I<00:01:33.350> was<00:01:33.470> using<00:01:33.800> throughout<00:01:34.040> the

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
same colors I was using throughout the

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.860 
same colors I was using throughout the
whole<00:01:34.310> entire<00:01:34.520> piece<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.790> it<00:01:37.790> conveys<00:01:38.570> an

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
whole entire piece so it conveys an

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.230 
whole entire piece so it conveys an
overall<00:01:39.350> mood<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.830> feeling<00:01:40.370> I<00:01:40.460> guess<00:01:40.640> because

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
overall mood a feeling I guess because

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.170 
overall mood a feeling I guess because
different<00:01:41.570> colors<00:01:41.810> mean<00:01:42.350> different<00:01:42.409> things

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
different colors mean different things

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.270 
different colors mean different things
as<00:01:44.180> far<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:44.510> emotions<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.380> how<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.830> read<00:01:46.100> them

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
as far as emotions and how you read them

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.160 
as far as emotions and how you read them
um<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:47.210> kind<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.659> personal

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
um it's kind of like a personal

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.070 
um it's kind of like a personal
exploration<00:01:48.979> I<00:01:49.400> guess<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:49.940> far<00:01:50.180> as<00:01:50.330> myself

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
exploration I guess as far as myself

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.830 
exploration I guess as far as myself
trying<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.860> get<00:01:51.979> over<00:01:52.070> issues<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.840> integrate

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
trying to get over issues and integrate

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.719 
trying to get over issues and integrate
the<00:01:54.200> figure<00:01:54.470> with<00:01:54.710> space<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.369> things<00:01:55.610> like

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
the figure with space and things like

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.960 
the figure with space and things like
that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
that

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.370 
that
things<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.450> normally<00:01:56.690> incorporate<00:01:57.170> into

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
things that normally incorporate into

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.820 
things that normally incorporate into
your<00:01:57.409> life<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:58.520> expressing<00:01:59.450> them<00:01:59.570> in<00:01:59.830> paint

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
your life just expressing them in paint

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.990 
your life just expressing them in paint
I<00:02:00.979> guess

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.020 

I<00:02:05.030> don't<00:02:05.630> know<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:06.740> guess<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.760> viewer

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
I don't know I I guess for the viewer

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.840 
I don't know I I guess for the viewer
just<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.860> appreciate<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.040> as<00:02:10.130> art<00:02:10.430> not

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
just to appreciate it as art not

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.440 
just to appreciate it as art not
necessarily<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:12.730> go<00:02:13.730> any<00:02:13.910> deeper<00:02:14.150> than<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
necessarily to go any deeper than that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.480 
necessarily to go any deeper than that
maybe<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> since<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:15.800> personal<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
maybe because it since it's personal you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.920 
maybe because it since it's personal you
may<00:02:16.610> not<00:02:16.760> understand<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> same<00:02:17.660> level

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
may not understand it the same level

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.100 
may not understand it the same level
that<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.080> meant<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.940> project<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.480> images<00:02:20.810> so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that I meant to to project the images so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.750 
that I meant to to project the images so
you<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.920> appreciate<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.550> without

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you can appreciate it without

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.450 
you can appreciate it without
understanding<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.380> can<00:02:25.310> also

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
understanding it but you can also

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.760 
understanding it but you can also
understand<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.480> without<00:02:26.720> appreciating<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.500> so

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
understand it without appreciating it so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.040 
understand it without appreciating it so
you<00:02:28.640> don't<00:02:28.790> need<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.240> or<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.480> other<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.960> order

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050
