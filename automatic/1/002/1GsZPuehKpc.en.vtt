00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.749
 if you do not like very much 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.939
 multiplications I'll show you a 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:10.500
 different method of doing it for example 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:13.169
 if we want to multiply 13 by 21 we go 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.100
 to start putting a slanted line in 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:19.410
 this case we start with 1 and then the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.180
 next digit says 3 in 3 we go to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.320
 put 1 2 3 separate lines and on the other 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.520
 part inclined otherwise would be the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 2 another would be 1 2 and then 1 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.060
 Now what we're going to do is count the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.880
 intersections or junctions of these straights 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.480
 in this case there would be a two three 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.370
 four five six there are six here is one 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.440
 Two Three 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.570
 here is one and here there are two corners 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.269
 we are going to separate and those that are in 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.190
 the center we are going to add those points of 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:06.070
 crosses here are six and one of seven this 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.420
 is a three and this is a two therefore 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.119
 the result of this multiplication 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 simply with counting the points of 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.200
 crosses is equal to 273 that if done 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.780
 the multiplication of the way 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.240
 traditional will give this result in 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.050
 the case that the number of points or 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.780
 crosses is greater than 9 in this case is 21 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.910
 as in a traditional multiplication 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.429
 the most important digit in this case is the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.880
 the right will be removed and sent to 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.500
 the sum of the points of the grade that is 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.050
 here on the left or these crosses 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.159
 central here the sum age also more 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.310
 of 9 age 43 plus the 2 that we carry from 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.520
 45 same as the digit of greater weight is 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.399
 send to the left side to the sum this 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.800
 case gives 20 but because it is the last one 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.270
 add in this case the 4 of 24 and what 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.149
 is going to be put as a result of this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.670
 multiplication would be 1 which is the digit 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.759
 on the left the next digit is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.390
 5 and this as it adds up to 20 and the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.330
 24 complete finally in the case that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.239
 have numbers with more digits the idea is 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.340
 the same are going to draw the amount of 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.860
 lines depending on the quantity 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.239
 to indicate each digit also in this 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.680
 case there is a zero so it gets 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.560
 discontinuous way and they are not going to 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.420
 consider these crosses here is going to have 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.300
 more groups than in the previous cases 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.569
 they are separated as always the ends and 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.660
 are going to form central groups are going 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.180
 counting the crosses if it passes 9 and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.069
 we know that we carry the digit to the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.030
 next position on the left in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.150
 this case the result is 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.910
 268 and the last day 24 in this other 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.970
 example they also have a larger amount of 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.440
 digits and the idea is equal they separate 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.600
 the corners and here in this case there are 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.660
 three groups that can be observed from 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.550
 diagonally and if they ask for 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.680
 what does this work about counting points 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.540
 we consider that a multiplication is 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.600
 a shortened sum then here we have 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.120
 by drawing five lines in this way and 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.980
 other three in a contrary way we can 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.010
 observe that for each line there will be 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.610
 five crosses as there were three will be 5 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.550
 5 5 15 that would be the same operation that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.830
 we are doing here that is 15 ok in 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.410
 the exercises that were done here 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.480
 There may be doubt as to how I know 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.100
 these groups have to be added or these 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.790
 you have to leave aside where 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.320
 I can deduce this, remember that the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.430
 13 can also be written in notation 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.350
 scientific as 10 by 13 and 21 as 2 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.990
 for 10 more 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.510
 if this multiplication of a 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.610
 way that the first term multiplies 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.410
 the other two and the second term to the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.120
 two others 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.550
 we can reach the same result and here 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.950
 can be appreciated even doing the 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.620
 multiplication in this way that groups 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.100
 are the ones that have to be added 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.380
 obviously the 3 only the 2 alone and the 6 the 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.140
 1 are going to add here in what I did the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.530
 6 and 1 add it that is with an example 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.590
 already trying to generalize if they are named 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.780
 to the digits there see for example also 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.610
 obviously they can be in the first one 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.370
 it can be 0 but it can be up to 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.470
 9 they also become again 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.080
 scientific notation multiply it 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.050
 group by their weight if in 10 or those that 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.600
 multiply by 1 and you can appreciate 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.230
 here that this one would have to draw with 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.110
 the number of lines of amount of 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.140
 straight that is 16 from 0 to 9 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.350
 and it is in number of quantity lines 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.440
 of lines and these multiplications by 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.420
 it means that they are the ones 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.370
 points that are at your intersection in 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.920
 this case a by c would be the points that 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.560
 they're here 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.840
 those of minor would be of bd with b these 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.280
 are the ends go apart and those that are 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.800
 they will add or those who have the same 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.990
 weight multiplied by 10 here is me 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.900
 indicating that they are the intersections of 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.330
 the points a of between would be these with d 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.490
 what are these who are here short and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.890
 Sometimes these two are the ones 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.840
 effectively they are grouped in the center they 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.180
 you can continue doing this analysis for 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.520
 more digits and that's where you're going 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.790
 go saying what you have to group 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.550
 d would be at the end of the lower 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.650
 they go alone that too and here you can 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.430
 observe what the groups are but not 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.290
 by way of 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.600
 graphs you can see that the 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.760
 extremes are always going to be separated and 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.410
 they will be doing groups diagonally and 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.040
 so we can get an idea of why 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.040
 pass this
