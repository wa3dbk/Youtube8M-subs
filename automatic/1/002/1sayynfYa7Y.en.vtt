00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
really curious to see how it would stop
up<00:01:55.560> against<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.460> long<00:01:56.969> strike<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.819> it's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
up against the long strike and it's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.569 
up against the long strike and it's
almost<00:02:00.420> about<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.109> same<00:02:01.289> size<00:02:01.499> long<00:02:02.310> strike

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
almost about the same size long strike

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
again is just a little bit longer if

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.570
