00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
might look one way on the mannequin than

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.129 
might look one way on the mannequin than
it<00:04:24.630> does<00:04:24.810> on<00:04:25.080> your<00:04:25.500> own<00:04:25.889> ass<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:27.000> bye-bye<00:04:27.870> you

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:39.119 

see

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.919 

I<00:04:39.219> can<00:04:39.879> already<00:04:40.300> tell<00:04:40.629> that<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.889> looks<00:04:42.039> fuller

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:42.929 
I can already tell that it looks fuller

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:45.929 
I can already tell that it looks fuller
and<00:04:43.929> it<00:04:44.080> feels<00:04:44.379> heavier<00:04:45.129> obviously<00:04:45.729> because

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:45.939 
and it feels heavier obviously because

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:52.119 
and it feels heavier obviously because
there's<00:04:46.119> more<00:04:46.300> hair

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.290 

Oh<00:04:52.509> Oh

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.159 

I<00:04:56.979> don't<00:04:57.979> think<00:04:58.309> I'm<00:04:58.459> even<00:04:58.639> gonna<00:04:58.879> cut<00:04:59.239> it<00:05:02.169> it

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
I don't think I'm even gonna cut it it

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.290 
I don't think I'm even gonna cut it it
looks<00:05:04.749> like<00:05:05.749> a<00:05:05.779> brand<00:05:06.199> new<00:05:06.379> egg<00:05:06.729> so<00:05:07.729> obviously

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
looks like a brand new egg so obviously

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.320 
looks like a brand new egg so obviously
you<00:05:08.449> can<00:05:08.509> tell<00:05:08.839> that<00:05:09.169> it's<00:05:09.529> much<00:05:09.830> fuller<00:05:10.330> it's

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
you can tell that it's much fuller it's

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.429 
you can tell that it's much fuller it's
a<00:05:11.479> little<00:05:11.809> longer<00:05:12.050> because<00:05:12.409> I<00:05:14.019> think<00:05:15.019> this

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
a little longer because I think this

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.129 
a little longer because I think this
week<00:05:15.649> was<00:05:15.830> like<00:05:17.319> 14<00:05:18.319> inches<00:05:18.830> maybe<00:05:19.159> and<00:05:20.139> the

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
week was like 14 inches maybe and the

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.279 
week was like 14 inches maybe and the
hair<00:05:21.619> that<00:05:21.739> I<00:05:21.830> bought<00:05:22.099> was<00:05:22.399> 18<00:05:23.059> inches<00:05:23.449> so

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
hair that I bought was 18 inches so

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.980 
hair that I bought was 18 inches so
obviously<00:05:24.740> it's<00:05:24.979> a<00:05:25.099> little<00:05:25.519> longer<00:05:26.119> now<00:05:26.449> but<00:05:26.959> I

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
obviously it's a little longer now but I

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.679 
obviously it's a little longer now but I
kind<00:05:27.439> of<00:05:27.499> actually<00:05:27.709> like<00:05:28.159> the<00:05:29.029> layer<00:05:29.240> of<00:05:29.449> fact

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 
kind of actually like the layer of fact

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.089
