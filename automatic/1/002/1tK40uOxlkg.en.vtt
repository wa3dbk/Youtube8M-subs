00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 you are watching a proven program 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.470
 created specifically for the site 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.960
 territory of beauty 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 and today i suggest checking out the crayons and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.650
 they were created explicitly for those who want 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.969
 make your hair very bright 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.789
 today decided to try for the first time 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.619
 color crayons which recently 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.300
 went on sale because always 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.730
 interesting to see how your hair 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.519
 will look so unusual bright 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.320
 colors because there is enough 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 spectacular palette represented for example 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.540
 blue coral 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.210
 purple pink and blue 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 the name is also very interesting for example 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.640
 roses called 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 sweet sixteen pink that is sweet 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.590
 16th anniversary in pink let's see what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 I get and whether or not hair 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 and the quality is another color and will it be 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 noticeably surrounding for this procedure 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.109
 I will need the paint itself special 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.090
 sponge and also oilcloth or towel though 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.540
 Of course the manufacturer claims that these 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.970
 hands do not stain your clothes or face 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 better protect yourself 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.180
 I finished the staining procedure and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.580
 applied everything without a shade here 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.460
 purple blue in fact turned out 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.720
 pink turning into orange and 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.420
 Violet 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.610
 what do I think about this procedure for 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.220
 home use is enough 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.590
 convenient that is, if there is no time to run in 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.490
 salon then why not do it at home 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.980
 This whole process took me about 40 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.380
 minutes plus 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.720
 procedures in that it is very convenient not 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.510
 need to flush no need to wait for some 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.270
 unthinkable amount of time all quickly 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.040
 learn to almost immediately freezes 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.100
 do you eavesdrop neatly 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.870
 hair dryer and everything itself is all ready yes 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.740
 if necessary, you can repeat to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.420
 color was more intense intense 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.940
 certain cons that hair 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.030
 really became more dry became 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.140
 get tangled become more naughty and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.569
 I am afraid that even after 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.209
 first shampooing this 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.180
 the effect will not go away so of course such 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.830
 the effect is not worth doing very often from 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.410
 accapi some style party 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.120
 hippie seems to me quite good 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.980
 option my attitude to finely 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.150
 well, it's not on the show version anymore 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 it is better 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.170
 used at trade shows when it's 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.970
 competition takes place when do such 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.330
 hairstyles need some bright shades 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.970
 crayons they dry their hair dry better 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.280
 after these crayons use masochki 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.709
 any argan oil 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 some to moisten them a little 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.850
 take this dryness to feed them from and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.450
 everyday life just tips will be 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.209
 spoil 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.320
 I'll have to take the often very clean 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.820
 haircuts and do hair treatment + and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.970
 dries quickly 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.580
 instantly dye hair no cons 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.910
 sufficiently saturated colors strongly dried 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.910
 hair 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.070
