00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.789
 the people who did it if we put 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 in Italian, of course, but here it is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.580
 music on the details screen 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.050

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.420
 boot not statue bio 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 okay training instead of training in 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.620
 English at random continues to play new 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.940
 option is not there in this game for 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 this bailout plan 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.980
 a man by we call it ass existence 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.870
 it really worries us is a stuff that 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.190
 you can't really believe the dance 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 that you are ugly characters 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.719
 they were absurd 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.330
 which of course we are not talking about 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.060
 with grandfather diaries so much talk but that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.090
 you can't talk so they don't have 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.790
 call peter that tummy day like 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.890
 heidi brut hunt how ugly it is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.250
 ugly 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 I don't type the name from one of those 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.650
 cartons and tarot cards made by the Chinese no 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 that they sold on videotape or if 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.530
 come of inter and not this first there 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.960
 avoid that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.610
 after bad it goes well maybe gameboid mans 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.259
 but not naga resolution but kind not 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 they are making drawings to make sure that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.149
 it had to do without seeming cut out 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.890
 bad no look that is obvious we have 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.659
 made drawings a sparse program bug 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 with pupae int so no and then have them 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.960
 shrunk to stay with us there 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.579
 let's move the game in series a 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.100
 the general exhibition of heart or fan 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.360
 nick 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.239
 the goats make you goodbye must 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.660
 gather flowers how ugly that is 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.260
 design 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.239
 okay then to monsters fucking the flowers in short 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 it's substance puts a platformer ever made 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:23.860
 so a kid silky ours 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.860
 cottage we dig like snowflake 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.170
 then you get really jumps 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.890
 absurd to be the kind girl 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 it was heidi high what we do a method 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:42.200
 from a method 10 from those who make money 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:50.680
 some do not know of two meters and 40 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.680
 world record leaps very low no 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.329
 forward as said is fucking but it's beautiful 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.040
 from which type he pressed forward for a 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.940
 nanosecond issued I did not fall 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.530
 immediately after that it was quiet a year 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.100
 he favors heidi here all the objects here 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.600
 but really I don't know if I blame it 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.220
 of the planned exalt little the birth 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.340
 tutor who told him you have to do a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.319
 hydro game said how we do it 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.209
 here I remember in the radial case of 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.330
 all these things flying platforms 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.960
 that they were in the air were typical bo 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 in the cardboard even years that you throw from 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.250
 let's make it jump from 300 meters 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.540
 survived nothing is done of course 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.380
 you can jump off a building 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.890
 no wonder borno is done type 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.500
 call 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.720
 we go on obviously when 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.930
 will win jumps of at least 10 meters in 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.650
 high super never seen an affirmation 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:03.840
 needless to say that the level from which 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.750
 the children come but what laughter for which 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.720
 the first enemies arrive to kill them 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.820
 singing it rightly before you 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.820
 then we know off and kills curls kind 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.390
 are the sheep 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.500
 fortunately it does nothing if not to the di 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:29.310
 the goats hurt you 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.380
 oh well let's jump up a fox from 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.750
 fucking we killed him in san caduti 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.669
 oh well it plays like this and now it is me 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.990
 gone they don't say finished because it's not 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.120
 true I absolutely went a little 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.110
 forward in the levels so I have to say more 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.090
 ahead there is the city like that but it 's already there 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.540
 the fact that there is play when I am 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.340
 be an absurd jaime thing I wonder 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.980
 who is the one who got the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 guts to say we are playing and 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.060
 let's end it hand breaker and now to 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.620
 analyst type one hundred percent you can not 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.630
 play a game on something like aillon 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.810
 then I got something branded for 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.810
 land 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.910
 I had some kind of side springboard 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.370
 lost another life 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.700
 Juve are playing football is not 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.790
 that there is much to say that you have been cascading 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.560
 use but what cascaded them how it does 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.060
 a waterfall starting from the rock that 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:38.690
 fuck what the fuck but really 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:41.160
 oh well, but that's how I was there on titles 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.040
 our like little dick in the ass and 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.320
 I'm sorry this game 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.750
 no no there is also some good training a 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.770
 those who cheer redo different redemptions 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.010
 things here city ​​valley 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.560
 in short, it is certainly nothing to do here 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.920
 a game very fine for itself and for 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.870
 end is heidi's game that yes all the 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.840
 its such things to of a bit and i do the 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.040
 yoke over unless you do some kind of 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:15.480
 I don't know film but neither interactive one 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.280
 little soda of how visual novel eco have 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.630
 time in accordance with the genre but more or less 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.780
 plus you can't play a game on 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.790
 security plans is a platform the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.010
 fuck you heidi jumping those that 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.900
 however this guide to the di bergamo 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.030
 advanced the short review but why 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.500
 there is little to say in the game unfortunately there is 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:37.080
 an idea something so simple 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:43.080
 stupid that you can't sum it up anymore 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:45.630
 six minutes five minutes so it will be 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.880
 the next episode was ragala 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.880
 your under-game situation 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.430
 bailouts goes well with our game
