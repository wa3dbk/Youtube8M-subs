00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
now the cover it was the perfect choice

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.719 
now the cover it was the perfect choice
for<00:00:54.839> us<00:00:55.229> to<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.469> our<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:55.800> carbon<00:00:56.190> fiber<00:00:56.399> bike

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
for us to be our first carbon fiber bike

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.700 
for us to be our first carbon fiber bike
we<00:00:57.149> call<00:00:57.359> it<00:00:57.479> our<00:00:57.600> quiver<00:00:57.839> killer<00:00:58.199> because

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
we call it our quiver killer because

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
we call it our quiver killer because
it's<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> bike<00:00:59.729> that<00:01:00.299> needs<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it's really a bike that needs to do a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
it's really a bike that needs to do a
lot<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.530> different<00:01:01.890> styles<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.969> riding

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
lot of different styles of riding

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
to enduro racing and a lot of our

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.249 
to enduro racing and a lot of our
customers<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.360> their<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.080> only

customers this is their one and only

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.710 
customers this is their one and only
bike<00:01:10.649> so<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.009> has<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.490> work<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> multitude<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
bike so it has to work at a multitude of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.669 
bike so it has to work at a multitude of
terrains<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> disciplines<00:01:15.200> for<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> design

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
terrains and disciplines for the design

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.859 
terrains and disciplines for the design
we<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.189> took<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.399> blank<00:01:17.820> sheet<00:01:18.149> approach<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
we really took a blank sheet approach to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.169 
we really took a blank sheet approach to
this<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.500> started<00:01:19.950> from<00:01:20.100> scratch<00:01:20.280> from

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
this and just started from scratch from

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.539 
this and just started from scratch from
the<00:01:21.990> design<00:01:22.319> inspiration<00:01:22.679> we<00:01:23.069> really<00:01:23.340> looked

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the design inspiration we really looked

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
the design inspiration we really looked
outside<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> bike<00:01:24.659> industry<00:01:24.899> we're

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
outside of the bike industry we're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
outside of the bike industry we're
looking<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.190> at<00:01:26.459> like<00:01:26.640> Italian<00:01:27.560> supercars

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
looking more at like Italian supercars

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.029 
looking more at like Italian supercars
and<00:01:29.330> motorcycles<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.569> really<00:01:31.080> give<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> bike

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
and motorcycles to really give the bike

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.770 
and motorcycles to really give the bike
a<00:01:32.340> super<00:01:32.880> bold<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.659> unique<00:01:34.500> look<00:01:35.780> every

a super bold and unique look every
detail<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> bike<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:38.539> meticulously

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
detail of the bike was meticulously

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.380 
detail of the bike was meticulously
looked<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.470> thought<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.119> look<00:01:42.299> at

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
looked at and thought of if you look at

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
looked at and thought of if you look at
the<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.840> cable<00:01:43.229> routing<00:01:43.409> how<00:01:44.340> clean<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.819> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the the cable routing how clean it is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.620 
the the cable routing how clean it is
and<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.840> pivot<00:01:46.080> hardware<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.090> every

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and the pivot hardware to the every

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.109 
and the pivot hardware to the every
little<00:01:48.750> finish<00:01:49.170> detail<00:01:49.679> on<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.340> was

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little finish detail on it was was

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
little finish detail on it was was
definitely<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.629> looked<00:01:51.959> over<00:01:52.319> we're<00:01:53.069> pretty

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
definitely like looked over we're pretty

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609

excited<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.200> came<00:01:55.349> up<00:01:55.410> with

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
excited with the what we came up with

excited with the what we came up with
and<00:01:56.039> how<00:01:56.369> unique<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.879> bike<00:01:57.060> looks<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.629> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and how unique the bike looks and and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.290 
and how unique the bike looks and and
how<00:01:58.349> we<00:01:59.340> didn't<00:01:59.550> just<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.849> the<00:02:00.000> existing

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
how we didn't just take the existing

how we didn't just take the existing
cover<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.080> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> smooth<00:02:01.470> some<00:02:01.679> lines<00:02:01.890> out

outdoor our back door so it's a good
trail<00:02:15.420> used<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.989> test<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.409> bike<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
trail used to test the bike because you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910 
trail used to test the bike because you
can<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.239> really<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.470> such<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> short

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
can you can really see it's such a short

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740 
can you can really see it's such a short
trail<00:02:20.099> at<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> minute<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.819> any<00:02:21.090> small<00:02:21.239> change

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
trail at a minute that any small change

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.309 
trail at a minute that any small change
you<00:02:21.870> make<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:24.060> add<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> second

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
you make if you if you can add a second

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.680 
you make if you if you can add a second
or<00:02:25.470> take<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> second<00:02:26.069> off<00:02:26.159> your<00:02:26.310> time<00:02:26.569> that's<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
or take a second off your time that's a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.770 
or take a second off your time that's a
pretty<00:02:27.870> big<00:02:28.140> improvement<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:30.300> setting

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
pretty big improvement on a setting

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.300 
pretty big improvement on a setting
change<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.349> bike<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:32.040> really

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
change to your bike and it's really

00:02:32.310 --> 00:03:00.220 
change to your bike and it's really
noticeable<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.540> trail

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.849 

period<00:03:43.450> transition<00:03:43.930> bikes<00:03:44.170> we've<00:03:44.709> been

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
period transition bikes we've been

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.000 
period transition bikes we've been
thinking<00:03:45.129> about<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.969> balls<00:03:47.010> technology

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
thinking about and balls technology

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.250 
thinking about and balls technology
for<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.549> really<00:03:48.879> long<00:03:49.060> time<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.689> we<00:03:50.019> really

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
for a really long time and we really

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.599 
for a really long time and we really
thought<00:03:50.439> that<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.680> new<00:03:50.799> carbon<00:03:51.129> covert<00:03:51.459> was<00:03:51.579> a

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
thought that the new carbon covert was a

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.039 
thought that the new carbon covert was a
perfect<00:03:52.090> opportunity<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.629> bring<00:03:52.840> these

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
perfect opportunity to bring these

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.259 
perfect opportunity to bring these
technologies<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.950> market<00:03:54.099> Cobb<00:03:54.939> is

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
technologies to market Cobb is
