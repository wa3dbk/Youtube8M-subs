 hello this time we will test 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.050
 new intel core i7 5770 5 processor and 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.710
 on his example we learn the benefits 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.509
 14-nanometer process technology so far 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.279

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.109
 desktop processor market 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.029
 their main rival intel switched to

 then n.d. 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.449
 accordingly, a large manufacturer 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.680

 conducted at a frequency of 3,600 megahertz also 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.770
 we want to note that at maximum 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.020

 the novelty is significantly superior

 in almost all respects

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.980

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.569
 used the following equipment in 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.849

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.790
 computer performance and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.380
 shutdown results in about six 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.420
 percent in speed drop 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.010
 systems do not say that the difference was too 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.290
 very significant but when performing 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.230
 resource intensive tasks can come in handy as 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.120
 we assumed the separation of intel core i7 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.620
 on average by 14 percent and the old man 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.150
 intel core i7 4770 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.040
 and at all made almost equal 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.599
 only one percent behind unfortunately 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.000
 we were not able to test

 flagship model intel core i7 4790 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.260
 kay but there is no doubt that she would 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.290
 ahead of the hero of the review despite this 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.060
 intel core i7 5770 5 still looks 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.730

 recommended price intel core i7 5770 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.940
 as a toy trade, it is likely 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.730
 will fluctuate between 400 420 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.829
 dollars for comparison core i5 4590 key 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.680
 will cost you today about 310 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.600
 dollars and fx 8370 and at all 200 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.639
 dollars it is obvious that in terms of price 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.680
 capabilities of both these processors looks 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.720
 much better but the hero of the review can 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.819
 compete with the circuit in the field of discrete 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.980

 longer than intel iris pro graphics 6200 i 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.709
 so now on this front the company 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.590
 intel has bypassed its eternal rival 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.090
