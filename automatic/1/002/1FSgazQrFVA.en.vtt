sliders<00:00:02.419> the<00:00:03.419> two-foot<00:00:03.810> carbon<00:00:04.140> core<00:00:04.350> is

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
sliders the two-foot carbon core is

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.559 
sliders the two-foot carbon core is
great<00:00:04.950> for<00:00:05.400> running<00:00:05.670> gun<00:00:05.790> filmmaking<00:00:06.240> it
