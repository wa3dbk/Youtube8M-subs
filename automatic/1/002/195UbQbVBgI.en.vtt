00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.150
 the radar spotted bombs there have 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.830
 found death in a poll of 57 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 today is to show you the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 little bug that I found and is happening 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.510
 exactly here I could name the map 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.580
 and to lie down like this and his 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 appendix where survives c then ben it is 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.859
 quiet comfortable and there is a need 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.580
 to make and wait for enemies and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.330
 dilapidated kept links to a 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.330
 system where I am 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 for that dear as a shit I am 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.690
 always protected and then that's what 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.810
 or to my life 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.900
 redemption 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.840
 we are activated 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.920
 look at us shoot at nothing 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:17.240
 do because my colleague who does 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:19.450
 the whole team and then that's it 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.450
 here 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.500
 Well, it was a nice little bug in 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.259
 enjoy 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.090
 and then to have fun as long as he is not 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.350
 patched yet happy so to go out 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:43.940
 it's a bit complicated I go through 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:46.009
 there and then that's good so we're going 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.690
 try again to hold on like that so much 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.990
 to pass a short video of 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.250
 very simple very very cool and at the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.450
 phone that rings it's always when 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:01.759
 I'm a video here it is five a321 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.759
 I do not know what he will land and then 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.209
 I continue with this little glitch 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.019
 bridge and blue barack immediately 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.019
 four years ago 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.870
 and the trick is played there is more than 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.549
 wait then only necessarily 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.099
 the enemies they will come back on us and 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.290
 good they will come alone 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:32.090
 there is more to wait we will talk 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.409
 drones it's a bit boring here's what 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.150
 there I think he'll come back 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.150
 exactly to try to protect themselves 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.359
 as much as to make dedication to him in time 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.739
