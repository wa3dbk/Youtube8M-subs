00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.940
 let's start with the top of 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.039
 the strawberry and here is now let's put 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.039
 a few leaves and a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.810
 and you think 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.410
 and now let's do 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.200
 kind of heart to make the way of 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.010
 Strawberry and there is the will prey 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.210
 finished now let's show how 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.870
 the strawberry looks when it has already 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.710
 colors and pointing red and 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.880
 pink and I also put your points 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.890
 yellows now let's see how I draw 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.890
 the strawberry in it 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.299
 kind of quick drawing and you can see that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.450
 the colors that are used lighter color 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.670
 and a darker color to give 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.240
 dimension to the strawberry to make it look 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.960

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.720
