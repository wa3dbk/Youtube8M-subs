and go to the to the ground quickly and
yeah<00:02:05.230> it's<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:06.100> shows<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.550> lot<00:02:06.730> of

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
yeah it's it's it shows a lot of

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.130 
yeah it's it's it shows a lot of
resemblance<00:02:07.450> that's<00:02:07.720> right<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:09.570> but<00:02:10.570> it's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
resemblance that's right and but it's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.080 
resemblance that's right and but it's
just<00:02:11.440> funny<00:02:11.770> thing<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.460> can<00:02:12.790> be<00:02:12.910> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
just funny thing that I can be the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.850 
just funny thing that I can be the
smallest<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.750> team<00:02:13.960> while<00:02:14.140> he<00:02:14.410> has<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.770> be

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
smallest of the team while he has to be

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.410 
smallest of the team while he has to be
the<00:02:14.980> biggest<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.610> tea<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.850> tallest<00:02:16.300> of

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the biggest of the tea the tallest of

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:30.480 
the biggest of the tea the tallest of
the<00:02:16.480> team<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.110> that's<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> one<00:02:17.950> contradictory

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.610 

we<00:02:31.490> get<00:02:31.700> some<00:02:32.030> more<00:02:32.240> interest<00:02:33.170> some<00:02:33.410> more

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
we get some more interest some more

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.100 
we get some more interest some more
attention<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.250> course<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:35.210> yeah<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.930> works

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
attention of course so yeah it works

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.970 
attention of course so yeah it works
both<00:02:36.410> ways<00:02:36.710> but<00:02:37.070> yeah<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.420> i'm<00:02:39.410> happy<00:02:39.860> i'm

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
both ways but yeah it's a i'm happy i'm

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.920 
both ways but yeah it's a i'm happy i'm
not<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.370> famous<00:02:40.670> i<00:02:41.060> guess<00:02:41.300> because<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.810> know

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
not that famous i guess because you know

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230 
not that famous i guess because you know
when<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.260> go<00:02:42.410> visit<00:02:42.770> our<00:02:42.860> brother<00:02:43.070> in<00:02:43.730> London

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
when we go visit our brother in London

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.080 
when we go visit our brother in London
or<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.510> madrid<00:02:44.890> he<00:02:45.890> cannot<00:02:46.490> really<00:02:46.700> go<00:02:46.910> out

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
or in madrid he cannot really go out

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.300 
or in madrid he cannot really go out
without<00:02:47.510> having<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.650> know<00:02:48.710> pose<00:02:49.070> for

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
without having to you know pose for

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.370 
without having to you know pose for
pictures<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.970> your<00:02:50.180> autographs<00:02:50.750> or<00:02:50.930> something

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
pictures of your autographs or something

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.790
