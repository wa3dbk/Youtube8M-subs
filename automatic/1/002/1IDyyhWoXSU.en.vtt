00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.569
 in the 50s we could meet on the roads of Auvergne a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.860
 front wheel drive with rear wheels with variable orientation 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 it was one of the first michelin gauge cars 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.800
 thirty years later an assembly the tests continues 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.079
 the ladoux test center occupied 450 hectares north of Clermont-Ferrand 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 on 40 kilometers of tracks every day of the year cars drive 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 continues 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.940
 it's not about winning a race 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.050
 but to go to the maximum of study possibilities to test 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.050
 to their extreme limits 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.770
 but it's not just cars 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 there are also everyday cars 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.430
 yours 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.220
 who do what maybe 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 you will never do that to them 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.570

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.790
 the goal 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.820
 let's leave the handling circuit to go to this plateau luisao 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.990

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.020
 the basalt coating tine finally coefficient of adhesion that neighbor's 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.020
 that of the ice 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.649
 measures the maximum speed at which the car maintains its 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:23.609
 path 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.700
 and at the same time the tester tests the ease with which he catches up with the 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699
 car when she picks up 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.040
 the reactions particular the different common 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.040
 different sculptures are very sensitive on wet ground 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.269
 in a tight bend 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.760
 the tests compared to speeds determined under conditions 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.699
 constant

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.789
 it's the dreaded thing to do
