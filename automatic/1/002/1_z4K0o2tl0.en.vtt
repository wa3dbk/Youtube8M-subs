00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.399 
guys on the top are that are attacking
the<00:01:27.509> gold<00:01:27.720> mine<00:01:27.900> they're<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the gold mine they're going to be

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.550 
the gold mine they're going to be
getting<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.680> gold<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:30.409> alright<00:01:31.409> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
getting some gold out of that alright so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.690 
getting some gold out of that alright so
as<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.770> move<00:01:31.799> along<00:01:32.220> they're<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
as they move along they're going to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
as they move along they're going to
attack<00:01:32.909> some<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> builders<00:01:33.450> huts<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.869> well<00:01:34.200> as

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
attack some the builders huts as well as

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.100 
attack some the builders huts as well as
the<00:01:34.470> gold<00:01:34.710> mine<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> left<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.900> have

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the gold mine on the left and I have

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.190 
the gold mine on the left and I have
reached<00:01:37.350> 40,000<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.610> 40%<00:01:39.000> damage<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
reached 40,000 so or 40% damage so it is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.730 
reached 40,000 so or 40% damage so it is
plausible<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:41.009> I'll<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:42.170> 250<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.439> um<00:01:43.560> as

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
plausible that I'll get 250 but um as

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.139 
plausible that I'll get 250 but um as
you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> zoomed<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> check<00:01:45.030> if

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you can see I zoomed out to check if

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.399 
you can see I zoomed out to check if
there's<00:01:45.329> anything<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> corners<00:01:46.140> because

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
there's anything on the corners because

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
there's anything on the corners because
sometimes<00:01:46.740> people<00:01:47.159> leave<00:01:47.280> free<00:01:47.490> building<00:01:47.820> on

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
sometimes people leave free building on

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850 
sometimes people leave free building on
the<00:01:47.970> corners<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> does<00:01:49.439> look<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.710> I'm

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the corners but it does look like I'm

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
the corners but it does look like I'm
getting<00:01:50.100> 50%<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.790> battle<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.780> did<00:01:52.140> get

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
getting 50% on this battle and I did get

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.660 
getting 50% on this battle and I did get
all<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> gold<00:01:52.829> he<00:01:53.070> had<00:01:53.100> available

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
all the gold he had available

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.090 
all the gold he had available
besides<00:01:54.149> 19<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> Town<00:01:55.560> Hall<00:01:55.710> or<00:01:55.979> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
besides 19 that's in the Town Hall or in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
besides 19 that's in the Town Hall or in
the<00:01:56.189> other<00:01:56.310> storage<00:01:56.899> but<00:01:57.899> yeah<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.259> that's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the other storage but yeah that's that's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.639 
the other storage but yeah that's that's
pretty<00:01:58.649> much<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.189> level<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.610> mean

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
pretty much it for this level I mean

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.600 
pretty much it for this level I mean
there's<00:02:01.649> nothing<00:02:01.740> else<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.430> take

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
there's nothing else I can really take

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
there's nothing else I can really take
except<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.119> 3000<00:02:03.630> elixir<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.110> I'm<00:02:04.170> not

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
except for that 3000 elixir but I'm not

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
except for that 3000 elixir but I'm not
going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> waste<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.680> troops<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.030> I'm

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
worried about that so let's go ahead and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.320 
worried about that so let's go ahead and
find<00:02:23.280> another<00:02:23.400> battle<00:02:23.819> what<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.150> were<00:02:24.239> waiting

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
find another battle what we were waiting

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.479 
find another battle what we were waiting
I'm<00:02:25.049> not<00:02:25.200> gonna<00:02:25.379> worry<00:02:25.500> about<00:02:25.680> getting<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.129> full

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
I'm not gonna worry about getting a full

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.699 
I'm not gonna worry about getting a full
base<00:02:27.299> of<00:02:27.480> troops<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:28.019> sometimes<00:02:28.409> you<00:02:28.590> can

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
base of troops because sometimes you can

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.800 
base of troops because sometimes you can
find<00:02:28.860> something<00:02:29.220> easy<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:30.540> might<00:02:30.659> get

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
find something easy and you might get

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.979

about getting rid of this stone right
here<00:04:21.719> in<00:04:22.229> case<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.740> could<00:04:22.919> expand<00:04:23.340> upward<00:04:23.789> so<00:04:24.539> I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
here in case I could expand upward so I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.719 
here in case I could expand upward so I
started<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.140> but<00:04:25.260> then<00:04:25.349> I<00:04:25.409> realized<00:04:25.890> there's<00:04:26.580> a

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
started it but then I realized there's a

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.510 
started it but then I realized there's a
stone<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.120> bottom

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
stone in the bottom

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.040 
stone in the bottom
corner<00:04:27.849> there's<00:04:28.060> only<00:04:28.150> two<00:04:28.360> stones<00:04:28.599> left<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:29.020> I

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
corner there's only two stones left so I

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.010 
corner there's only two stones left so I
can<00:04:29.259> go<00:04:29.379> ahead<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.740> cancel<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.190> one<00:04:30.370> and

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
can go ahead and cancel this one and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.270 
can go ahead and cancel this one and
start<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.139> my<00:04:32.259> next<00:04:32.560> one<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:32.979> I'm<00:04:33.069> going<00:04:33.220> to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
start on my next one so I'm going to

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.200 
start on my next one so I'm going to
fast<00:04:33.400> forward<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.759> so<00:04:33.879> you<00:04:33.940> guys<00:04:34.060> don't<00:04:34.180> have

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
fast forward it so you guys don't have

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.969 
fast forward it so you guys don't have
