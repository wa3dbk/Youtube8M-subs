00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
in an October of 2013 I'm guessing to be

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.240 
in an October of 2013 I'm guessing to be
releasing<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> same<00:00:28.349> day<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> pokemon<00:00:29.070> x

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
releasing on the same day that pokemon x

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
releasing on the same day that pokemon x
and<00:00:29.400> y<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.550> released<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.359> far<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.840> 3s<00:00:31.140> XL<00:00:31.470> has

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and y is released so far the 3s XL has

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
and y is released so far the 3s XL has
only<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.130> announced<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.579> japan<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.180> i

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
only been announced for japan but i

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.610 
only been announced for japan but i
think<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.809> better<00:00:33.840> chance<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
think there is a better chance of it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.660 
think there is a better chance of it
being<00:00:34.710> released<00:00:35.040> outside<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.579> Japan

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
being released outside of Japan

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.490 
being released outside of Japan
considering<00:00:36.360> Pokemon<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.930> pretty<00:00:37.140> big<00:00:37.320> deal

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
considering Pokemon is a pretty big deal

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.979 
considering Pokemon is a pretty big deal
around<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.280> world<00:00:38.489> plus<00:00:39.180> North<00:00:39.450> American<00:00:39.930> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
around the world plus North American I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
around the world plus North American I
think<00:00:40.230> Europe<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> pikachu<00:00:41.280> three<00:00:41.579> s-xl

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
think Europe got the pikachu three s-xl

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
think Europe got the pikachu three s-xl
so<00:00:42.300> why<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> x<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> y<00:00:43.320> 1<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.010> course

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so why not the x and y 1 but of course

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
so why not the x and y 1 but of course
we'll<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> wait<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.329> official

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we'll just have to wait for an official

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
we'll just have to wait for an official
