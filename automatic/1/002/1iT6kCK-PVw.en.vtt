00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
the person off of your back if you find

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.960 
the person off of your back if you find
yourself<00:02:02.100> spinning<00:02:03.100> around<00:02:03.220> or<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.640> person

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
yourself spinning around or the person

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.800 
yourself spinning around or the person
getting<00:02:04.120> behind<00:02:04.480> you

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
getting behind you

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.960 
getting behind you
a<00:02:04.840> key<00:02:05.260> moment<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:05.740> when<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:05.980> get<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:06.430> arm

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
a key moment is when I get this arm

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.960 
a key moment is when I get this arm
underneath<00:02:07.420> my<00:02:07.870> elbow<00:02:08.379> is<00:02:08.709> doing<00:02:09.519> something

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
underneath my elbow is doing something

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.780 
underneath my elbow is doing something
this<00:02:10.420> elbow<00:02:10.959> my<00:02:11.470> right<00:02:11.710> elbow<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.370> actually

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
this elbow my right elbow is actually

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.120 
this elbow my right elbow is actually
flaring<00:02:13.270> out<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:14.350> keep<00:02:14.560> him<00:02:14.770> from<00:02:14.950> falling

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
flaring out to keep him from falling

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.990 
flaring out to keep him from falling
around<00:02:15.550> my<00:02:15.670> back

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
around my back

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.060 
around my back
I<00:02:16.060> come<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.510> tight<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:16.990> elbow<00:02:17.350> down<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
I come in tight with my elbow down the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.490 
I come in tight with my elbow down the
impact<00:02:18.700> will<00:02:19.210> hold<00:02:19.540> him<00:02:19.780> right<00:02:19.990> towards<00:02:20.350> my

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
impact will hold him right towards my

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940 
impact will hold him right towards my
back<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.880> once<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.350> elbow<00:02:23.770> is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
back so once I get here this elbow is

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.860 
back so once I get here this elbow is
out<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.400> into<00:02:24.580> his<00:02:24.730> chest<00:02:25.030> which<00:02:25.450> keeps<00:02:25.750> him

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
out and into his chest which keeps him

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.400 
out and into his chest which keeps him
from<00:02:26.740> spinning<00:02:27.390> into<00:02:28.390> me<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.960> that's<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.200> really

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
from spinning into me so that's a really

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.530 
from spinning into me so that's a really
common<00:02:29.740> thing<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> watch<00:02:30.280> out<00:02:30.490> for<00:02:30.700> when<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.270> go

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
common thing to watch out for when I go

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.790 
common thing to watch out for when I go
in<00:02:31.720> if<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.200> towards<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.500> camera<00:02:32.650> without

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
in if I do it towards the camera without

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.610 
in if I do it towards the camera without
a<00:02:32.980> body<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:34.270> soon<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.840> pull<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:35.560> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a body as soon as I pull this in but the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.470 
a body as soon as I pull this in but the
arm<00:02:35.830> comes<00:02:36.070> under<00:02:36.400> my<00:02:36.520> chest<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.090> elbow

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
arm comes under my chest and this elbow

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.770 
arm comes under my chest and this elbow
goes<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.110> up<00:02:38.260> against<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> chest<00:02:39.780> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
goes out and up against the chest that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.720 
goes out and up against the chest that
being<00:02:41.050> said<00:02:41.350> we're<00:02:42.100> not<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.400> there<00:02:42.610> and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
being said we're not in there and

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.070 
being said we're not in there and
hanging<00:02:43.090> out<00:02:43.180> with<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.840> position

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
hanging out with it in this position

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.900 
hanging out with it in this position
just<00:02:44.350> holding<00:02:44.800> on<00:02:44.920> because<00:02:45.070> all<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.490> movement

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
just holding on because all the movement

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.310 
just holding on because all the movement
is<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.240> start<00:02:46.450> jostling<00:02:46.930> things<00:02:47.140> loose

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
is going to start jostling things loose

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.949 
is going to start jostling things loose
so<00:02:47.860> we<00:02:47.980> still<00:02:48.190> move<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.489> our<00:02:48.610> control<00:02:49.030> but

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
so we still move to our control but

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.420 
so we still move to our control but
what's<00:02:50.140> gonna<00:02:50.230> buy<00:02:50.470> us<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.800> time<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
what's gonna buy us the time to get to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.979 
what's gonna buy us the time to get to
that<00:02:51.580> control<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> first<00:02:52.300> place<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
that control in the first place is

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.449 
that control in the first place is
making<00:02:53.290> sure<00:02:53.620> once<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.950> pull<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.220> under<00:02:54.370> my

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
making sure once I pull that under my

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.100 
making sure once I pull that under my
chest<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:55.000> elbow<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.510> controlling

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
chest that this elbow is controlling

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:06.390 
chest that this elbow is controlling
that<00:02:56.140> spin<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.470> another<00:03:05.709> common<00:03:05.920> problem<00:03:06.220> that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
that spin so another common problem that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.550 
that spin so another common problem that
we<00:03:06.580> run<00:03:06.730> into<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.330> once<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:07.780> move<00:03:08.020> from<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
we run into is once we move from the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.860 
we run into is once we move from the
dive<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:08.980> drive<00:03:09.160> into<00:03:09.910> our<00:03:10.030> baseball<00:03:10.450> batter

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
dive and drive into our baseball batter

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.340 
dive and drive into our baseball batter
position<00:03:11.620> we've<00:03:11.860> got<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> arm<00:03:12.280> locked<00:03:12.640> out

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
position we've got the arm locked out

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.199 
position we've got the arm locked out
that<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.470> be<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> tendency<00:03:14.800> for<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.340> spiral<00:03:16.060> to

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
that can be a tendency for a spiral to

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.970 
that can be a tendency for a spiral to
happen<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:17.020> we<00:03:17.050> kind<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.320> get<00:03:17.410> caught<00:03:17.650> going

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
happen so we kind of get caught going

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800 
happen so we kind of get caught going
about<00:03:18.370> round<00:03:18.640> those<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.090> circle<00:03:19.390> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
about round those in a circle the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.360 
about round those in a circle the
biggest<00:03:20.110> problem<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:21.040> if<00:03:21.250> you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
biggest problem with that is if you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.580 
biggest problem with that is if you
start<00:03:21.640> spinning<00:03:22.000> around<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.510> circle<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
start spinning around in a circle the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.500 
start spinning around in a circle the
force<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.280> us<00:03:24.549> spinning<00:03:24.850> around<00:03:25.150> eventually

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
force of us spinning around eventually

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.210 
force of us spinning around eventually
as<00:03:25.989> we're<00:03:26.230> spinning<00:03:26.440> he's<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> start

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
as we're spinning he's going to start

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.759 
as we're spinning he's going to start
pulling<00:03:27.459> away<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.590> position

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
pulling away and this is the position

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.500 
pulling away and this is the position
that<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.250> do<00:03:30.310> not<00:03:30.640> want<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:30.940> end<00:03:31.060> up<00:03:31.209> because

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
that I do not want to end up because

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.120 
that I do not want to end up because
that<00:03:31.630> hands<00:03:31.870> gonna<00:03:32.019> come<00:03:32.230> into<00:03:32.350> play<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
that hands gonna come into play or you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.080 
that hands gonna come into play or you
can<00:03:33.250> just<00:03:33.400> rip<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:33.760> on<00:03:33.910> free<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:35.730> what<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:36.760> want

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
can just rip that on free so what I want

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.500 
can just rip that on free so what I want

happen to be able to run him into or
over<00:03:51.100> something<00:03:51.489> that's<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:52.570> benefit<00:03:53.019> for

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
over something that's more benefit for

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.460 
over something that's more benefit for
me

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.840

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
from spinning another area that

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.490 
from spinning another area that
sometimes<00:04:06.000> pops<00:04:06.510> up<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.870> again<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.320> just

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
sometimes pops up and again this is just

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.720 
sometimes pops up and again this is just
something<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.800> happens<00:04:08.220> when<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.490> don't

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730

what it should look like take a step

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.000 
what it should look like take a step
back<00:04:32.310> here<00:04:32.570> as<00:04:33.570> we<00:04:33.930> go<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.290> ground<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.710> move

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
back here as we go to the ground I move
