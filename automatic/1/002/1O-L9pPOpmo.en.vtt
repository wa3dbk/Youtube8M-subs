00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.259
 very good to all kids that such 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.209
 You are here I have a new gameplay 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.529
 of black ops 2 but good this is going to be 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:07.939
 a background gameplay is simply for 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.130
 talk a little news you just 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.679
 leave today regarding the connection 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.639
 permanent of the new good boom xbox 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.049
 the rumors 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.150
 there were many rumors that they said of 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.980
 that a connection was going to be necessary 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.260
 permanent internet that if I do not know what 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.510
 well there they have pronounced at the end 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.130
 microsoft 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.690
 and they have made it official of some 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.030
 way that is they do not call it a 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.800
 permanent connection but it's like it's like 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.070
 If it were, it will not be necessary 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.200
 internet connection every 24 hours what 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.630
 happens if we do not connect every 24 hours 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.770
 our our xbox to internet so that 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.810
 will stop playing any game 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.320
 will continue watching television and will 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.760
 you can play blu ray but what 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 important thing that interests us is that it leaves 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.970
 to run games directly good 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.910
 as I tell you, it would be every 24 hours that 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.220
 do it from our xbox but if 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.190
 we play from another system the connection 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.500
 it will have to be every hour or so it sees a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.650
 I do not know how much I laugh at not crying 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.720
 but I do not know will be necessary every hour 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.030
 as long as we want to access 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 our library of games good they 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 they say that for an experience for a 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.810
 Optimal experience does not require a 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 connection as a minimum have said 1.5 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.130
 megabytes per second and well then where 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.259
 there is no cover obviously 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.259
 a lot of people take her on a trip or 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.479
 I know it house or home 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.130
 your grandparents or whatever is not any 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.080
 site and there for example there is no connection 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.060
 broadband as micro is recommended 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.649
 a mobile connection or you have to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.960
 have internet with you yes or yes in the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.840
 pocket always not good have also 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.300
 commented that good leaving aside this 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.690
 that is an ax, let alone the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.080
 people who had thought to buy the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 we went to the next thing that is that they 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.070
 have said that this is going to be a kind 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.500
 of tools that are going to leave the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.910
 developers then to see me 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.380
 I explain a little why for example 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.090
 they have said this about the connection 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.440
 permanent such and such have said that this 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.150
 they leave it a little in the air so that 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.340
 game developers decide 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.880
 finally implement in their games or 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.790
 not this I do not know what a bit like 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.860
 from my opinion I see it a bit like 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.990
 I do not know how to throw the stone and hide the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.840
 hand is not how it's like I leave it there 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.070
 quietly for people to use it 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.270
 that obviously will be used by all 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.030
 what I say that they will want to protect their 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.910
 titles but well this we will see 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.680
 As you go out I do not think 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.290
 no gambling company 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.530
 important is not going to implement 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.700
 that is already what is my opinion is then 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.750
 maybe we get a surprise 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 but I do not think 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.460
 then good they said that microsoft says 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.240
 that no case will receive money from these 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.500
 transactions also I do not doubt that in addition 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.570
 announces that during the launch of the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 console will not be possible to lend or 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.470
 rent games but give them away with 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.510
 some restrictions on the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.610
 restrictions if we want to give away a 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 game to someone this person should 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.420
 have remained on our list of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.070
 friends for at least 30 days and each 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.940
 game can only be given a single 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.230
 that is, let's recap it, be you 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.820
 example you want to give a game to your 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.030
 friend and you will tell him to have added 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.819
 previously 30 days before and only what 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.359
 you will be able to give once 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.560
 I do not know what you think about this, it seems to me 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.670
 I think that they do it for more than 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.349
 nothing for safety, not if someone 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.980
 access our our account 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.269
 microsoft because they can not be sent 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.269
 let's say for example if you have titles in 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.250
 your game library because I guess that 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.739
 they will do it so they can not enter your 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.120
 account you steal the direct game between 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.620
 start it steals I do not know what they pierce 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.810
 to your account and they leave you if a game 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 Well, I suppose they do it 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.379
 creation for this so that you have a 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.030
 maximum of 30 days to be able to recover 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.150
 the account because it is that another is that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.769
 I understand another reason to do this 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.859
 the truth and then good 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.370
 Finally, they have been talking 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.199
 about the kinect because a lot of people said 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.930
 that was going to be continuously on 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.030
 and it's going to be a big brother kind 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.969
 where our images do not and good 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.349
 finally they have said that first of all 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.840
 is the user's privacy with 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.380
 obviously they are going to say no they have already 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.620
 confirmed that the control of kinect 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.600
 will be able to see and hear 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.660
 to users but that users are going 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.490
 to have control of what you see and 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.020
 of what he hears 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.669
 says that during the installation of 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.099
 device will determine the degree of 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.289
 response and personalization that each 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.550
 want good obviously is what 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.319
 have to say if they want to sell the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.099
 console with the kinect always connected 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.840
 not clear is obviously us 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.860
 because they tell us but never 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.530
 we will be able to see what it is that 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.750
 really sent does not say that you can 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.250
 pay totally the kinect or 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.310
 configure it so that it only responds to 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.830
 xbox on directly so that for 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.650
 I turned on this I do not know how 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.599
 will recognize because I say that if you have 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.490
 that answer this command I say that 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.949
 will have to be listening to everything 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.080
 I did not do that, either 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.780
 I understand very well says that when the 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.500
 system is turned off it can be disabled 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.819
 this option I do not know I do not know they emphasize to 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.210
 that user will be able to have 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:22.980
 control full control always no I do not know 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.800
 how far it will be will this be true 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.940
 I suppose that in the e3 that was not wanted is 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.730
 I do not know if it was Tuesday 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.530
 I guess they explained a little more 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.800
 deeply this and I hope they lead to 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.860
 see the games that will take 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.990
 which will make the year out what 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.240
 is what really interests us so 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.129
 nothing I hope you liked it a little 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.440
 this video that I know I rolled up a 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.759
 egg but I hope you liked it and 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.599
 nothing I do not know next video kids 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.599
 goodbye
