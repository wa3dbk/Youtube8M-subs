00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.740
 we see an increase in the costs of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.960
 the payment of aging 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 retirement an increase in 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.219
 Healthcare is also related to the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.420
 aging of the population 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 And that means if we don't 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 intervene that yes the government always 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.550
 getting bigger 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.100
 it's an ever-increasing part of it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 national product actually goes on 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 the collective 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 That means getting taxes 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 further up and yes that suffocates 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.990
 and in fact the economy 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.579
 so nevertheless the solution will eventually 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.079
 I think that should be the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.559
 welfare state becomes 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.640
 reduced how politically unpleasant that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.250
 Also , the level of benefits will be on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 in the longer term 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.489
 make room for 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.489
 for economic activity 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 well i suggest to put the tax on 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.310
 labor for that 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.430
 significantly reduce the marginal rate 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.820
 way too high it is 52% 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.930
 the rate below is 42 percent yes that is 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.580
 quite a few 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.650
 so i would suggest to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.660
 you could actually actually eatin ideal 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.000
 for a rate for the for the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.090
 taxes on labor may still go 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.910
 at the ends you would have something else 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.560
 something on it may vary but you would 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.479
 can go to a rates on labor 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.740
 and that something should of course that would 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.479
 may be in the order of 35% 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.200
 I think that is possible to a great extent 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.720
 that too 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 budget neutral and to the extent that it is not 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.800
 you should look at the budget-neutral opportunity 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.390
 or you don't 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.229
 should also intervene in the level 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.369
 of the benefits at full the state pension would 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.860
 I think in the mean of very much 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.990
 people could well be lower and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.700
 because the elderly are not today 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.490
 more on the group that it financially 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.190
 hardest has on average taken there 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.300
 so you could think about that 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.090
 that you lowered the state pension 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.069
 maybe you would definitely make that sense 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.680
 can do differentiated to 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.720
 depending on the extent to which people are supplementary 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.450
 retirement we see the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.260
 outside world and therefore outside of Europe 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.360
 yes there it goes much faster those countries 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.840
 and then you think of southeast asia with you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.810
 also thinks of Latin America that countries 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.160
 they already grow much faster 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 maybe an occasional tip but 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.650
 on average, growth is therefore much faster 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.210
 they are also getting better at it 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.360
 the production of 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.580
 yes of quality goods while that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.530
 actually something is pair 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.530
 where must europe compete and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.270
 because we can't compete on it 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.680
 yes I know a lot of textiles and such 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.740
 compete for knowledge 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.330
 products but good those countries outside 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.090
 Europe they are getting better and better there 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.580
 in so that means we do a lot 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.470
 must actually do ours 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.560
 competitive position our international 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.690
 to maintain its competitive position 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.610
 and I think it's actually there 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.410
 government spending goes wrong 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.910
 its very tall am very tall 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.640
 welfare states 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.370
 but then teaching 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.020
 again relatively little because actually 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.740
 the expenditure on education 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.990
 repressed by spending that on 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.560
 welfare state and I think 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.330
 that we really have to reconsider 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.670
 yes how big does that government have to be 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.230
 what should the role of the government be and 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.910
 where should the government spend their money 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.690
 and then I am the government 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.960
 his money has to spend much more on 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.280
 expenditures that say the 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.680
 yes competitiveness 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.150
 productivity of our population and 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.490
 can get up 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.250
 it is not Dutch to be tough 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.840
 grabbing it is right it is not 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.000
 Dutch to intervene so hard 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.210
 nothing by the way 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.069
 well i think it is hard to intervene 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.290
 in the Eurozone 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.599
 yes also say something that is not 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.329
 usual that has something to do with it 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.650
 to do with the fact that she thinks quite 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.349
 people mean real people 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.109
 have become used to being there 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.979
 a government is ready to take them up 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.009
 to catch 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.380
 yes and then you get looked at with people 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.060
 will adjust to this automatically 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.410
 So we know the risks are 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.410
 received by the government 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.780
 yes and then it becomes less and less 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.220
 and people will adjust to that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.199
 it is also becoming less and less acceptable 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.550
 that 8 is intervened and yes that 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.430
 means that we have to make choices 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.530
 because yes you can do better 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.930
 distribute wealth than have to distribute poorly 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.460
 and if we are not careful then yes then go 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.030
 we are slowly but surely going 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.020
 impoverish in any case compared to 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.020
 from other countries outside Europe
