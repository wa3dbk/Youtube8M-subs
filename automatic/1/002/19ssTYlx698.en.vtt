00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello dear friends in my opinion this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.000
 video will be one of the shortest that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.859
 I've ever laid out on my channel but 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 I really wanted this thing 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.099
 I mention it very much 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.920
 liked it his gg3 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.590
 namely the implementation of smart pause I was driving 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 went to the subway watched the match money in the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.039
 bank ww federation and something attracted me 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 I wanted to somehow suspend 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.789
 replay but i just turned it off 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.150
 screen you that he and I did not distract 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 he did like this all 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 replay has become on the slider this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 very much surprised I tried 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.750
 one more time again and really this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.329
 works exactly like smart pause it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.850
 Of course, they dress much better than this. 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.789
 It was done in the Samsung well in the same 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.030
 galaxy s3 s4 when he watched your 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 a glance apparently a century is better to learn from 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.940
 others' mistakes one of their own that cannot 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 not happy and so simple turn 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.480
 smartphone can pause 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 video playback is true naturally 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
 there are a couple of downsides to this solution 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.799
 The first playback must begin 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.260
 manually 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.990
 which of course I think big labor well 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.549
 for no one will make up because 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.200
 pushing one button is pretty cool 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.110
 it is clear that to pause the same 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.330
 push one button but just rejected 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 lowered the hand with the phone and got on 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.770
 pause it did not turn away a look suddenly 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.170
 accidentally looked aside in general 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.369
 Samsung is the implementation suffered no 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.049
 I do not want to say anything bad about 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.540
 samsung and i like these devices but 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.790
 the implementation of the implementation will be on all 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 did come out better sorry for 100 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.409
 laconic so strange and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.900
 quite a small moment well 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.360
 respectively, the second minus is valid 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.430
 if you watch the video now turn 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.829
 if you watch the video 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
 lying for example on the couch run 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.960
 replay then turn away from yourself and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.670
 pause is no longer well 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.189
 probably all the same it is not so much to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 Regrettably, this is probably a fault 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.909
 when working with a gyroscope although lack 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 Generally it can not be called done 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.840
 pretty interesting pretty good 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.939
 smart pause as already thank you very much 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.220
 by the way it is not clear why they did not speak 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.080
 At the presentation there was a similar pogrom I 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.130
 heard nothing of the kind 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 By the way, congratulations 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.340

 defeated however yes I got carried away 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.000
 In short, here is such a March pause and where 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.760
 I understand that it could fit in 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 seconds 15 put in instagram but 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.640
 I wanted to share it here so 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.120
 here is such 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.330
