hundred<00:00:28.769> people<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.070> stands<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.199> had

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
hundred people in stands so you had

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.959 
hundred people in stands so you had
quarterbacks<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> little<00:00:32.489> shaky<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:32.940> times

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
quarterbacks for a little shaky at times

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.709 
quarterbacks for a little shaky at times
but<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.590> practice<00:00:34.800> hopefully<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.480> can

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
but it's just practice hopefully we can

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.650 
but it's just practice hopefully we can
continue<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.250> try<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> find<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.420> who<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
continue on and try to find out who the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
continue on and try to find out who the
best<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.070> obviously<00:00:41.070> can't<00:00:41.399> play<00:00:41.700> for

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
best is obviously can't play for

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.930 
best is obviously can't play for
quarterbacks<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.719> we're<00:00:42.899> doing<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.230> now

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
obviously we're not going to be a team

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.400 
obviously we're not going to be a team
folks<00:03:10.280> 50<00:03:10.489> times<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:11.000> game<00:03:11.180> obviously<00:03:11.870> right

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
folks 50 times a game obviously right

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.650 
folks 50 times a game obviously right
now<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.459> we'll<00:03:13.640> try<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.120> figure<00:03:14.269> out<00:03:14.480> what

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
now so we'll try to figure out what

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.839 
now so we'll try to figure out what
wouldn't<00:03:14.870> do<00:03:14.959> best<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.890> go<00:03:16.129> from<00:03:16.280> there<00:03:16.430> how

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
wouldn't do best and go from there how

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.850 
wouldn't do best and go from there how
do<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.090> evaluate<00:03:17.330> what<00:03:17.989> Connor<00:03:18.260> did<00:03:18.500> today

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
do you evaluate what Connor did today

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.380 
do you evaluate what Connor did today
behind<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.310> first<00:03:19.489> team<00:03:19.730> offense<00:03:19.849> at<00:03:20.239> line

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
behind the first team offense at line

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.570 
behind the first team offense at line
versus<00:03:20.900> what<00:03:21.410> perry<00:03:21.680> did<00:03:21.860> today<00:03:22.099> behind<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
versus what perry did today behind the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.880 
versus what perry did today behind the
second<00:03:23.000> all<00:03:23.900> right<00:03:24.080> here<00:03:24.319> didn't<00:03:24.620> have<00:03:24.739> much

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
second all right here didn't have much

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.130 
second all right here didn't have much
yeah<00:03:25.069> see<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.580> would<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.599> second

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
yeah see you would think the second

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.380 
yeah see you would think the second
defense<00:03:27.920> wouldn't<00:03:28.280> rush<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:28.610> much<00:03:28.819> as<00:03:29.120> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
defense wouldn't rush as much as the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.320 
defense wouldn't rush as much as the
first<00:03:29.599> defense<00:03:30.049> right<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.160> think<00:03:31.790> he<00:03:32.060> was<00:03:32.209> in

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
first defense right so I think he was in

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.059 
first defense right so I think he was in
there<00:03:32.480> with<00:03:32.569> some<00:03:32.750> different<00:03:33.019> ones<00:03:33.200> also<00:03:33.920> at

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
there with some different ones also at

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.650 
there with some different ones also at
