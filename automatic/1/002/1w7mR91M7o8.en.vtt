00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that 9 let's just jump in and see what

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.609 
that 9 let's just jump in and see what
Sigma<00:00:28.919> has<00:00:29.159> to<00:00:29.369> say<00:00:29.749> because<00:00:30.749> it<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> Sigma

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
Sigma has to say because it is Sigma

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.390 
Sigma has to say because it is Sigma
it's<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.220> sigma

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.340 

he's<00:00:35.970> been<00:00:36.180> behind<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.720> blah<00:00:36.990> blah<00:00:37.170> blah<00:00:37.200> blah

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
he's been behind all blah blah blah blah

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.730 
he's been behind all blah blah blah blah
and<00:00:37.800> his<00:00:38.640> dialogue<00:00:39.300> changes<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.410> stopped

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
and his dialogue changes to have stopped

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.230 
and his dialogue changes to have stopped
didn't<00:00:41.490> you<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:41.580> it<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:41.850> strange<00:00:41.970> you

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
didn't you think it was strange you

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.680 
didn't you think it was strange you
could<00:00:42.360> beat<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:43.080> is<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> real<00:00:43.500> Sigma<00:00:44.690> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
could beat me this is the real Sigma and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
could beat me this is the real Sigma and
since<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.230> already<00:00:46.320> fought<00:00:46.620> him<00:00:46.770> I'll<00:00:47.160> kill

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
since we already fought him I'll kill

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.570 
since we already fought him I'll kill
him<00:00:47.970> off<00:00:48.150> screen<00:00:48.800> okay<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.830> told<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.220> kill<00:00:50.400> them

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
him off screen okay I told to kill them

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.690 
him off screen okay I told to kill them
and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.120> saying<00:00:51.600> stuff<00:00:52.560> about<00:00:52.740> it'll

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
and I was just saying stuff about it'll

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.420 
and I was just saying stuff about it'll
all<00:00:53.790> be<00:00:53.970> in<00:00:54.030> vain<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.660> he<00:00:54.900> explodes<00:00:55.380> inside<00:00:55.770> me

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
all be in vain and he explodes inside me

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.600 
all be in vain and he explodes inside me
or<00:00:56.670> something<00:00:57.330> I<00:00:57.450> love<00:00:57.690> doing<00:00:57.810> that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.660 

and<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:01.240> was<00:01:01.390> Sigma<00:01:01.810> all<00:01:01.960> along<00:01:02.320> again<00:01:02.710> who's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
and it was Sigma all along again who's

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.950 
and it was Sigma all along again who's
behind

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
behind

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.080 
behind
so<00:01:05.650> we're<00:01:05.830> going<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.159> destroy<00:01:06.460> his<00:01:06.610> hot<00:01:06.790> intas

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
so we're going to destroy his hot intas

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.410 
so we're going to destroy his hot intas
completely<00:01:07.600> we'll<00:01:08.590> split<00:01:08.740> up<00:01:08.830> for<00:01:09.010> now<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:10.210> we

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
completely we'll split up for now no we

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.250 
completely we'll split up for now no we
don't<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.690> deploy<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> zero<00:01:11.409> no<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.840> right<00:01:14.050> be

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
don't get deploy a zero no all right be

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.680 
don't get deploy a zero no all right be
right<00:01:14.440> back<00:01:14.650> again<00:01:15.010> while<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.369> like<00:01:15.729> see<00:01:16.540> if

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
right back again while I like see if

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.609 
right back again while I like see if
there's<00:01:16.930> any<00:01:17.080> more<00:01:17.290> differences<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:18.460> show<00:01:18.610> off

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
there's any more differences to show off

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.080 
there's any more differences to show off
so<00:01:20.619> there's<00:01:20.830> like<00:01:21.009> no<00:01:21.340> Cup<00:01:21.670> team<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:22.060> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
so there's like no Cup team that the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.430 
so there's like no Cup team that the
mother<00:01:22.330> computer<00:01:22.720> now<00:01:22.810> because<00:01:23.080> MIDI<00:01:23.320> and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
mother computer now because MIDI and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.580 
mother computer now because MIDI and
techno<00:01:23.770> are<00:01:23.920> dead<00:01:24.220> still<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.380> guess<00:01:26.380> this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
techno are dead still I guess this

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.090 
techno are dead still I guess this
happens<00:01:27.070> after<00:01:27.640> normal<00:01:28.420> mode<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.920> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
happens after normal mode this is the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100 
happens after normal mode this is the
same<00:01:30.310> shit<00:01:30.640> all<00:01:30.820> over<00:01:30.880> again<00:01:31.479> which<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.750> really

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
same shit all over again which is really

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.630 
same shit all over again which is really
actually<00:01:32.320> kind<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.800> weird<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.399> have<00:01:33.550> to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
actually kind of weird that you have to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
actually kind of weird that you have to
do<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.880> same<00:01:34.060> thing<00:01:34.330> twice<00:01:34.630> anyway

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
do the same thing twice anyway

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.640 
do the same thing twice anyway
I'm<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.890> again<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.000> lots<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.360> fun

I'm here again we had lots of fun
playtime's<00:01:40.650> over<00:01:41.630> transform<00:01:42.710> ooh<00:01:43.940> he<00:01:44.940> exits

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
playtime's over transform ooh he exits

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.070 
playtime's over transform ooh he exits
the<00:01:45.690> same<00:01:45.990> thing<00:01:46.350> basically<00:01:47.930> now<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:48.990> going

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
weakness is rolling shield um megaman x

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.880 
weakness is rolling shield um megaman x
1<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.540> didn't<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.170> before<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.680> now
