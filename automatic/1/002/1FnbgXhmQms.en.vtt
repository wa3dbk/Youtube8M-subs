00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.000
 hi to all friends and welcome again 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.940
 once in dario's house today to do 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.010
 a very simple recipe a pasta 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.380
 tomato and basil 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.230
 this because I know that in the comments on 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.480
 facebook or in the forums there are people who 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 they have the magic cooker and not 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.949
 they can use it because the pasta 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.140
 that is overcooked because it is not good 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.330
 because there is also a question of 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.930
 mentality then anyway for this 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:53.000
 recipe I'm using 200 g of 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.850
 penette about 12 of this tomatoes 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.290
 kind and fan about a pound of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.430
 basil 50 grams of onion salt two 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.799
 water and oil glasses then 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.000
 let's proceed to put the oil 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.450
 in the saucepan we raise the flame 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.090
 we add the onion we cover with m 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.990
 cooper and let us wilt for two 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 mind then two minutes passed lowers 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.560
 a little bit the fire 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.960
 I find I add the chopped tomato 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.630
 big pieces is a pinch of salt 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.899
 don aggirata 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.079
 I discover with cooper means and I continue to 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.789
 one minute cooking the minute is past 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.909
 I raise the flame and you just need to 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:55.939
 add the pasta two glasses of 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:01.100
 a little bit of basil water is a little bit 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.009
 of salt over we turn we come well the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.579
 pasta we cover with cooper media 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.319
 let's start nine minutes of time 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.750
 initially the first minute on flame 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.239
 high and later we can also lower 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.209
 little bit the flame keep in mind that 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.260
 on the package of this pasta when cooked e 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.530
 of 11 minutes time expired we go to 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530
 to check 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:33.230
 we turn at this point if we can 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.750
 add a little bit of water because a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.360
 a little bit withdrew so we turn 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.100
 still we are on another little bit of 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.470
 basil we cover with magic cooker 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.780
 turn off the heat and let it rest 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.010
 a minute, here's a minute here 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.010
 we can find out 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.870
 let's check that the cooking liquid 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 it is not excessive if it was excessive 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.850
 we can leave covered again for a 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.290
 another minute that absorbs it slowly 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.310
 the pasta was there on the floor 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.310
 chat immediately 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:27.879
 little bit of basil and here it is ready 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.670
 very little time our pasta al 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.409
 very simple tomato and basil 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.959
 the thing I invite you to do is try 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.349
 because logically the water content 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.139
 may differ depending on the type of 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.269
 pasta if you use a fresh pasta just ad 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.840
 example half a glass of water for 100 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:50.650
 grams in general for dry pasta and a 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.719
 paper cup for 100 grams if then 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.669
 during cooking during an inspection 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.689
 which you can do after five minutes of 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.659
 cooking 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:02.189
 note that water is poor power 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.230
 stolen and add it during cooking 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.209
 thank you all for following me there 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.489
 see the next recipe e 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.889
