it will take a lot of it out of there

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.400 
it will take a lot of it out of there
there's<00:02:25.000> no<00:02:25.210> doubt<00:02:25.390> about<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:25.810> what

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
there's no doubt about that but what

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.780 
there's no doubt about that but what
happens<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.860> lot<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.040> cases<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.460> lot<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.670> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
happens in a lot of cases a lot of that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.730 
happens in a lot of cases a lot of that
red<00:02:28.030> clay<00:02:28.270> gets<00:02:28.750> embedded<00:02:29.200> into<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.710> fabric

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
red clay gets embedded into the fabric

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.880 
red clay gets embedded into the fabric
so<00:02:30.280> there's<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.520> lot<00:02:30.640> about<00:02:30.880> iron<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.600> clay

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
so there's a lot about iron in that clay

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.740 
so there's a lot about iron in that clay
and<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.130> really<00:02:33.490> bonds<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.150> everything<00:02:34.450> so

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
what really kills the top is the Sun

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.470 
what really kills the top is the Sun
okay<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.440> UV<00:03:11.800> rays<00:03:12.070> it<00:03:12.370> drives<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.180> threads

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
okay the UV rays it drives the threads

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.530 
okay the UV rays it drives the threads
it<00:03:13.750> bakes<00:03:13.990> everything<00:03:14.680> makes<00:03:15.460> things<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:16.060> mean

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540

it's<00:03:16.660> one<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.960> harshest<00:03:17.470> things<00:03:17.710> you<00:03:17.920> can

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
it's one of the harshest things you can

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.740 
it's one of the harshest things you can
you<00:03:18.400> could<00:03:18.640> happen<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.150> top<00:03:19.360> something

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
you could happen to the top something

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.270 
you could happen to the top something
gets<00:03:19.870> baked<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.260> Sun<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.770> of<00:03:20.830> course

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
gets baked in the Sun and of course

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.790 
gets baked in the Sun and of course
the<00:03:21.520> tops<00:03:21.760> turn<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> Sun<00:03:22.240> all<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.390> time<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.960> and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
the tops turn the Sun all the time I and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.340 
the tops turn the Sun all the time I and
so<00:03:24.310> what<00:03:24.460> this<00:03:24.580> does<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.660> puts<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.170> nice

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
so what this does is it puts a nice

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.080 
so what this does is it puts a nice
layer<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:27.010> protectant<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.790> almost

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
layer of protectant and almost

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.230 
layer of protectant and almost
moisturizes<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.870> fabric<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:30.760> bounce<00:03:31.000> all
