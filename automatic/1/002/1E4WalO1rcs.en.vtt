the<00:01:05.790> knife<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.070> skeleton

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.120 
nothing over the crazy here took a few
hours<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.990> work<00:01:37.070> I'm<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.579> best<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:40.130> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
hours of work I'm not the best in in you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.210 
hours of work I'm not the best in in you
know<00:01:41.159> precision<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.270> detail<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
know precision or detail here but it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.560 
know precision or detail here but it
does<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> job<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.390> bit

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
does the job I might do a little bit

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
does the job I might do a little bit
more<00:01:45.600> work<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> didn't<00:01:46.470> stay<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> or

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
more work here I didn't stay in it or

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.870 
more work here I didn't stay in it or
anything<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
anything like that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
anything like that
tulip<00:01:48.479> wood<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> resonance<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> begin

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
tulip wood is kind of resonance to begin

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
tulip wood is kind of resonance to begin
with<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:51.270> works<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.630> great<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.990> me<00:01:52.049> all

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
with so this works out great for me all

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170 
with so this works out great for me all
right<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> final<00:01:53.040> mod<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.700> has<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
right and the final mod it has to do

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
right and the final mod it has to do
with<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> sheath<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.380> probably<00:01:55.500> notice

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
with the sheath and you probably notice

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170 
with the sheath and you probably notice
here<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> scale<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> put<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
here but the scale is here I put the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.280 
here but the scale is here I put the
scales<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.450> bit<00:01:57.659> too<00:01:57.780> far<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
scales a little bit too far up the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
scales a little bit too far up the
handle<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.040> I'm<00:01:59.610> kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> concerned

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
handle here and I'm kind of concerned

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
handle here and I'm kind of concerned
that<00:02:00.450> where<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.869> bites<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.439> hold<00:02:01.649> into<00:02:01.860> place

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that where it bites to hold into place

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.399 
that where it bites to hold into place
which<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.820> where<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:02.969> thumb<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
which is right here where my thumb is

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.020 
which is right here where my thumb is
will<00:02:04.409> probably<00:02:04.740> wear<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:04.920> over<00:02:05.070> time<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
will probably wear out over time so I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359 
will probably wear out over time so I
decided<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.930> leather<00:02:07.229> sheath<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
decided to make a leather sheath or a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
decided to make a leather sheath or a
case<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.629> still<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:09.869> very<00:02:10.200> good<00:02:10.319> at

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
case and I'm still not very good at

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.410 
case and I'm still not very good at
making<00:02:10.709> leather<00:02:11.520> products<00:02:11.970> here<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.300> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
making leather products here but this is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
making leather products here but this is
basically<00:02:12.629> what<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> got

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
basically what I got

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.509 
basically what I got
I<00:02:13.620> liked<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.760> had<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:16.310> joaquín<00:02:17.310> with

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
I liked what I had with the joaquín with

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.530 
I liked what I had with the joaquín with
the<00:02:17.580> back<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.849> knickers<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.269> mean<00:02:18.420> it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the back of knickers I mean it's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.710 
the back of knickers I mean it's
something<00:02:19.110> similar<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> except<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.150> just

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
something similar to it except I just

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.809 
something similar to it except I just
made<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> little<00:02:22.830> piece<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.099> leather<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
made a little piece of leather here and

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.040 
made a little piece of leather here and
there's<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.599> tan<00:02:24.780> Lee<00:02:24.980> tandy<00:02:25.980> Leather<00:02:26.489> outlet

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
there's a tan Lee tandy Leather outlet

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
there's a tan Lee tandy Leather outlet
nearby<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.590> I've<00:02:28.709> got<00:02:28.860> $20<00:02:29.550> worth<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.790> leather

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
nearby so I've got $20 worth of leather

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.809 
nearby so I've got $20 worth of leather
which<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> lot<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.580> fought<00:02:32.580> around

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
which is a lot and I just fought around

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.869 
which is a lot and I just fought around
and<00:02:33.239> quickly<00:02:33.540> made<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.049> couple<00:02:34.560> hours<00:02:34.879> again

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
and quickly made this couple hours again

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.039 
and quickly made this couple hours again
opted<00:02:36.629> for<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.260> same<00:02:37.910> mod<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.750> beginning

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
opted for the same mod as the beginning

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.300 
opted for the same mod as the beginning
of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> video<00:02:40.349> where<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> can<00:02:40.799> do<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> horizontal

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
of the video where I can do a horizontal

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.690 
of the video where I can do a horizontal
or<00:02:41.819> vertical<00:02:42.180> carry<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.410> or<00:02:43.700> left-handed

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
or vertical carry right or left-handed

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
or vertical carry right or left-handed
so<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.780> works<00:02:45.959> out<00:02:46.079> pretty<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.440> kind<00:02:46.890> of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
so this works out pretty good kind of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.339 
so this works out pretty good kind of
happy<00:02:47.130> with<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.480> want<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.140> put<00:02:49.319> down
