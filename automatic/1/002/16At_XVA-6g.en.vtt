00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
disappointed with so I think what I

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.360 
disappointed with so I think what I
might<00:00:53.350> do<00:00:53.559> is<00:00:53.679> I've<00:00:53.829> heard<00:00:53.949> of<00:00:54.100> this<00:00:54.160> brand

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
might do is I've heard of this brand

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.400 
might do is I've heard of this brand
called<00:00:54.730> testers<00:00:55.269> which<00:00:55.600> I'll<00:00:55.870> probably<00:00:56.109> give

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
called testers which I'll probably give

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.599 
called testers which I'll probably give
a<00:00:56.440> go<00:00:56.620> because<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:56.890> gives<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.160> nice<00:00:57.309> matte

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
a go because it gives it a nice matte

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.819 
a go because it gives it a nice matte
finish<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:59.050> wants<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.260> get<00:00:59.440> my<00:00:59.559> airbrush

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829

sorted<00:01:00.339> out<00:01:00.489> I'll<00:01:01.530> probably<00:01:02.530> use<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:02.800> to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
sorted out I'll probably use that to

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.210 
sorted out I'll probably use that to
varnish<00:01:03.999> them<00:01:04.150> as<00:01:04.300> well<00:01:04.449> but<00:01:05.199> let's<00:01:05.980> just<00:01:06.100> say

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
varnish them as well but let's just say

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.770 
varnish them as well but let's just say
that<00:01:06.340> we'll<00:01:06.490> focus<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:07.060> in<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:07.450> that's<00:01:07.570> my

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
that we'll focus that in so that's my

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.069 
that we'll focus that in so that's my
commissar<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.500> this<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.770> my<00:01:09.810> second<00:01:10.810> Creed
