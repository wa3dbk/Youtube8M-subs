 butter that we will do 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:46.950
 so we start right away with sugar 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:49.610
 ice cream that I'm sieved I add the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.610
 almond powder 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.010
 finally hands 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.900
 the egg white 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.790
 and I do not finish the butter flow 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.759
 this is the financial apparatus is over 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.039
 so it remains only to assaulted a 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.850
 mold and then put it in a pocket 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:57.500
 garnish the mussels and leave at the bottom 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.640
 go I'm going to fill my pocket I 'm going 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.640
 set up the first mold 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:29.220
 and here we go so we'll say twelve 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.110
 minutes 13 minutes at 180 Â° this is with the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.930
 amount of dough I prepared I 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760
 could do about 70 to 75 financial 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.830
 so it's mini financial of course 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.690
 you see it's going very fast if you have 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.160
 plates then also have you in 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.890
 in one time, ie in one 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.250
 quarter of an hour you will have finished your 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.900
 cakes 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.330

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.830

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.459

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.540

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.700
