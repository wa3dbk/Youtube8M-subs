00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:23.380
 believe in the existence of aliens 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.220
 No, why don’t I know I do n’t believe it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.779

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.660
 incomprehensible that did not appear no I neither 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.120
 I have never seen Lan Lan Gordon 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 I can definitely not say but the king is behind 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.149
 breakdown maul then this is say it by 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.899
 gifts and television can be trusted 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.449
 Well , by itself it seems not faith but 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.989
 this did not happen anything 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.379

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.340
 the phenomenon of stones was yuri know something 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.890
 these are all fairy tales 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 never met such but not 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:05.429
 sure what they are and maybe 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.429
 unusual take 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.159
 last year and how it looked 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.380
 can you describe 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.240
 a series of glowing objects at the side of the station 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 did not expect then started 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.459
 one by one show disappeared all 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 heard that dime doesn't like himself personally 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:34.539
 for only if 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.329
 some small fairy tales 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.329
 dots I run them will not show too 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:53.950
 appeared can't be they fly can 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:55.090
 but not believing honestly not at all 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.629
 because 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.239
 aware of my old man 

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:06.849
 what is the name but the relationship to this is not 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:10.299
 There can be no such thing in my opinion. But how? 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:13.239
 keep saying some object is not about 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:17.099
 green in anything I do not believe a single 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.099
 the faithful is no longer first
