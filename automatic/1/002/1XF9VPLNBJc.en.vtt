strife<00:01:56.130> they're<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> try<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
strife they're going to try and get this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.530 
strife they're going to try and get this
out<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> combat<00:01:57.689> regeneration<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
out of combat regeneration and so you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
out of combat regeneration and so you
feel<00:02:00.810> incentivize<00:02:01.290> try<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.710> hit<00:02:01.799> them<00:02:01.920> get

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
feel incentivize try and hit them get

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.499 
feel incentivize try and hit them get
them<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.490> combat<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.880> don't<00:02:03.119> want<00:02:03.360> them

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
them back in combat you don't want them

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.760 
them back in combat you don't want them
to<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.960> combat<00:02:04.200> regeneration

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
to get that out of combat regeneration

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
to get that out of combat regeneration
but<00:02:05.070> at<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> same<00:02:05.430> time<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.759> don't<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
but at the same time you don't want to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.610 
but at the same time you don't want to
extend<00:02:06.329> too<00:02:06.540> far<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.930> take<00:02:07.110> too<00:02:07.229> much

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
extend too far and take too much

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.790 
extend too far and take too much
so<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.850> adds<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.500> secondary<00:02:10.500> layer

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so it kind of adds this secondary layer

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
so it kind of adds this secondary layer
on<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.160> combat<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.210> makes<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
on the combat that just makes it a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.120 
on the combat that just makes it a
little<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.690> interesting<00:02:13.050> yeah<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.950> there's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
little more interesting yeah and there's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.830 
little more interesting yeah and there's
a<00:02:14.190> lot<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> nuance<00:02:14.730> surrounding<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.270> based<00:02:15.750> on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
a lot of nuance surrounding it based on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.720 
a lot of nuance surrounding it based on
what<00:02:15.960> Jane<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> sing<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.670> are

nixes<00:02:44.490> said<00:02:44.610> when<00:02:44.730> you're<00:02:44.820> not<00:02:45.090> taking<00:02:45.450> damage

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
nixes said when you're not taking damage

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.930 
nixes said when you're not taking damage
your<00:02:45.870> healing<00:02:46.200> faster<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:46.740> because<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
your healing faster but because of the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.880 
your healing faster but because of the
way<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.300> game<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.480> designed<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.650> just

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
way the game is designed this is just

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.770 
way the game is designed this is just
one<00:02:50.130> building<00:02:50.340> block<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.420> scheme<00:02:51.600> of

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
one building block in this scheme of

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.150 
one building block in this scheme of
strife<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.320> making<00:02:52.500> your<00:02:52.740> experience

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
strife that is making your experience

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.610 
strife that is making your experience
more<00:02:53.310> fluid<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.180> more<00:02:54.330> rithmatic<00:02:54.810> that's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
more fluid and more rithmatic that's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.620 
more fluid and more rithmatic that's
nice<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.370> idea<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.910> between<00:02:57.300> having

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
nice I like that idea to between having

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.970 
nice I like that idea to between having
you<00:02:57.780> know<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.020> shared<00:02:58.230> goal<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.620> person<00:02:58.830> can

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
you know that shared goal one person can

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.260 
you know that shared goal one person can
do<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.220> last<00:02:59.370> thing<00:02:59.610> while<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.910> person<00:03:00.210> is

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
do that last thing while one person is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.210 
do that last thing while one person is
kind<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.230> know<00:03:01.260> we're<00:03:01.770> healing<00:03:01.980> back

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
kind of like you know we're healing back

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.890 
kind of like you know we're healing back
up<00:03:02.460> getting<00:03:02.760> ready<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.180> know<00:03:03.300> maybe<00:03:03.480> shopping

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
up getting ready you know maybe shopping

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.090 
up getting ready you know maybe shopping
at<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.020> same<00:03:04.200> time<00:03:04.380> too<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.740> getting<00:03:05.010> new

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
at the same time too and getting new

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.770 
at the same time too and getting new
items<00:03:05.400> coming<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.790> them<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.690> be

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
items coming to them and then it can be

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.850 
items coming to them and then it can be
a<00:03:06.810> switch<00:03:06.990> off<00:03:07.140> maybe<00:03:07.320> they<00:03:07.470> took<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> little

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
a switch off maybe they took a little

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.170 
a switch off maybe they took a little
bit<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.070> damage<00:03:08.250> while<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:08.850> were<00:03:08.910> out<00:03:09.120> of

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
bit of damage while they were out of

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.490 
bit of damage while they were out of
protecting<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.780> doing<00:03:09.930> those<00:03:10.050> last<00:03:10.290> hits

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
protecting you and doing those last hits

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.110 
protecting you and doing those last hits
and<00:03:10.770> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.950> exposing<00:03:11.370> themselves<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.940> little

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and kind of exposing themselves a little

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.000 
and kind of exposing themselves a little
more<00:03:12.239> than<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:13.230> different<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.950> it's

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
more than you so it's different and it's

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.220 
more than you so it's different and it's
kind<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.400> fresh<00:03:14.640> take<00:03:14.880> actually<00:03:15.330> on<00:03:15.450> how<00:03:15.930> you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
kind of a fresh take actually on how you

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.500 
kind of a fresh take actually on how you
can<00:03:16.440> stay<00:03:16.680> immersed<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.970> right<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
can stay immersed in the right the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.820 
can stay immersed in the right the
action<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.020> whole<00:03:19.140> time<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.500> that's<00:03:19.680> that's

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
action the whole time so that's that's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.229 
action the whole time so that's that's
really<00:03:19.950> cool<00:03:20.340> let's<00:03:20.640> try<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:20.880> we're<00:03:20.940> trying<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
really cool let's try if we're trying to

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.790 
really cool let's try if we're trying to
create<00:03:21.540> an<00:03:21.720> experience<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.380> that's<00:03:22.500> what<00:03:22.650> we

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
create an experience and that's what we

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.960 
create an experience and that's what we
really<00:03:23.040> believes<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> an

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
really believes right this is an

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.150 
really believes right this is an
experience<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.780> we're<00:03:25.560> trying<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.800> do<00:03:26.010> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
experience and we're trying to do it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.270 
experience and we're trying to do it
without<00:03:26.550> any<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.989> no<00:03:28.080> gimmicks<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.620> people

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
without any you no gimmicks that people

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.229 
without any you no gimmicks that people
eat<00:03:29.310> people<00:03:29.580> are<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.850> eventually<00:03:30.060> see

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
eat people are going to eventually see

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.729 
eat people are going to eventually see
through<00:03:30.630> we're<00:03:30.750> trying<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.380> small

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
through we're trying to do it with small

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.770 
through we're trying to do it with small
mechanics<00:03:32.550> here<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.820> there<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.450> all

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
mechanics here and there that all

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.690 
mechanics here and there that all
together<00:03:34.020> build<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.830> nuanced<00:03:35.250> experience

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
together build up a nuanced experience

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.699 
together build up a nuanced experience
have<00:03:35.820> players<00:03:36.030> who<00:03:36.450> play<00:03:37.170> through<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.560> they

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
have players who play through it they

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.350 
have players who play through it they
might<00:03:37.860> not<00:03:38.040> realize<00:03:38.520> immediately<00:03:38.850> why

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
might not realize immediately why

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.660 
might not realize immediately why
they're<00:03:39.600> having<00:03:39.870> more<00:03:40.020> fun<00:03:40.050> but<00:03:40.860> after<00:03:41.220> 10

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
they're having more fun but after 10

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.460 
they're having more fun but after 10
games<00:03:41.940> after<00:03:42.180> 20<00:03:42.450> games<00:03:42.660> after<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:42.989> thousand

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
games after 20 games after a thousand

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.750 
games after 20 games after a thousand
games<00:03:43.650> they're<00:03:43.830> gonna<00:03:43.950> realize<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:44.550> some

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
games they're gonna realize for some

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.150 
games they're gonna realize for some
reason<00:03:45.150> than<00:03:45.600> magic<00:03:45.989> web<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.470> MOBA<00:03:46.709> genre<00:03:46.739> is

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
reason than magic web the MOBA genre is

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.560 
reason than magic web the MOBA genre is
there<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.520> strife<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.209> they<00:03:48.300> can<00:03:48.450> get

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
there and strife and that they can get

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.880 
there and strife and that they can get
to<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.780> more<00:03:48.900> quickly<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.320> more<00:03:49.410> frequently
