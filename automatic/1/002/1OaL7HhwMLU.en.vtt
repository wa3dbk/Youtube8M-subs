00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 there are many games that have come to what 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.510
 highest on own merits and from 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 then they go in card game is one of 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.289
 they add more with higher has a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
 very fun game very easy to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.100
 understand and with large doses of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.990
 fun where we will have to go 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.180
 nagging others and killing 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 all our rivals to be the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.710
 last man standing depends on whether we are 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 in the good or in the hand but in the end 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.690
 the goal is almost the same however 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.550
 very few have such a presentation 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.320
 original so striking and that we were 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 is as much in memory as this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.609
 edition of the bang bullet that we 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 includes the base game three of its 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.010
 expansions and also some letters 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.870
 specials that will add things to us and for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.810
 true a great star of zenith 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 let's see its contents 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.170
 Well, let's open this curious edition 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.400
 of the bullet the first thing is to remove this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 cardboard that you do not have to break what 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.080
 enough to extract it and now 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.490
 let's open the bullet that you believe is not 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.590
 the simplest thing in the world has a 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.240
 flat part a base for us to stay 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.570
 a little firm and now we have to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.030
 squeeze on one side and pull on the other 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.010
 to open this as if it were almost a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.870
 coffin and here we have first of all 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.130
 then the typical catalog the edge and the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.020
 instruction manual that comes a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.480
 little arched because this has this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.130
 this curious shape of cylinder is worth 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.960
 where the game is well explained 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.090
 all color and here we have by the way 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.010
 this can stand up and serve us 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 as a supplier of cards which is very 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.150
 Well, here we have the game itself 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 in these two frames we have the game 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.770
 base of bad that in case you do not know it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 well there are role playing cards on 7 and frank 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.940
 easy denying inflicted and letters of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.229
 15 different character that have 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.300
 different skills 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.729
 then the bank letters themselves to 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.979
 playing the game is worth so much this March 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.190
 like this are the game cards in addition 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.210
 we have some pretty summary letters 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.570
 tools 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 and this fatter magician that we see here are 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.940
 the three expansions that we have for a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.220
 or two fit and a big expansion that we 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.020
 they change the cards to play and on the other 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.670
 side a couple of small expansions that 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 are for a handful of letters and only before 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.300
 the danger are well identified by 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 the back here you have for 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 example for a handful of letters here 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.940
 there are those left over from danger and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 rest are from this special expansion of 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.440
 dodge city ​​we also have some letters 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.440
 more blank and three characters 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.630
 specials that come as exclusive to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.370
 this edition of going to ballack all together 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.590
 and finally we have this man 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.269
 nice a plastic star of 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.370
 sheriff that has up to a width that 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.630
 we want to hang up to indicate that you are 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.970
 the sheriff in each of the games 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.920
 well with they go with the expansion of just 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.420
 of danger with the expansion of dots 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.850

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.280
 of charges and special letters in addition 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.570
 of that brilliant superstar we have 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.190
 fun for a while 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.380
 in this classic game among the classics 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.610
 and that as I say has reached the highest 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.610
 for own merits
