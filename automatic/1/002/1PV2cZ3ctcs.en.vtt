00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to be over the top so nobody can see

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.910

that<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> front<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.530> then<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that in the front and then you kind of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
that in the front and then you kind of
just<00:01:20.100> square<00:01:20.880> everything<00:01:21.180> still<00:01:22.110> keeping

I once you get comfortable with the

I once you get comfortable with the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
moves what I've I've actually cut the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.330 
moves what I've I've actually cut the
deck<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.360> specific<00:04:27.630> location<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:29.070> reason

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
deck to a specific location the reason

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.820 
deck to a specific location the reason
you<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.640> two<00:04:30.480> cuts<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.930> because<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.410> seems<00:04:31.680> more

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
you do two cuts is because it seems more

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.770 
you do two cuts is because it seems more
random<00:04:32.220> if<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:32.910> were<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.620> do<00:04:35.450> one<00:04:36.450> is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
random if you were to just do one is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.390 
random if you were to just do one is
kind<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.140> obvious<00:04:37.290> what<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:38.010> happened

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
kind of obvious what just happened

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.110 
kind of obvious what just happened
especially<00:04:41.400> when<00:04:41.490> you're<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:41.760> moving<00:04:41.820> two

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
especially when you're just moving two

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.770 
especially when you're just moving two
cards<00:04:42.510> well<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.680> do<00:04:43.830> too<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.419> seems<00:04:45.419> more

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
cards well if you do too it seems more

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.750 
cards well if you do too it seems more
like<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.140> just<00:04:46.350> randomly<00:04:46.620> we're<00:04:47.040> cutting<00:04:47.669> the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
like you just randomly we're cutting the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.720 
like you just randomly we're cutting the
cards<00:04:48.120> at<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.290> point<00:04:49.590> all<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.100> work<00:04:50.340> for

cards at this point all of the work for
the<00:04:50.790> trick<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.150> done<00:04:51.440> all<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.770> have<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.980> do<00:04:53.100> is

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
the trick is done all you have to do is

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.400 
the trick is done all you have to do is
put<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.760> packet<00:04:54.210> on<00:04:54.300> top<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.750> other<00:04:54.900> it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
put one packet on top of the other it

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.400 
put one packet on top of the other it
doesn't<00:04:55.710> matter<00:04:55.860> which<00:04:55.980> one<00:04:56.040> goes<00:04:56.400> where<00:04:56.460> you

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
doesn't matter which one goes where you

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.659 
doesn't matter which one goes where you
can<00:04:58.410> give<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.650> bacteria<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.190> choice<00:04:59.400> on

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
can give this bacteria the choice on

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.460 
can give this bacteria the choice on
that<00:04:59.700> one<00:05:00.000> which<00:05:00.330> one<00:05:00.540> they<00:05:00.690> want<00:05:00.900> moved<00:05:01.110> over

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
that one which one they want moved over

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
which one they want on top I would not

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.930 
which one they want on top I would not
let<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.740> spectator<00:05:05.130> handle<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.640> cards

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
let the spectator handle the cards

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.370 
let the spectator handle the cards
because<00:05:06.120> they<00:05:06.360> might<00:05:06.540> fumble<00:05:07.110> them<00:05:07.230> or

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
because they might fumble them or

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.560 
because they might fumble them or
something<00:05:07.850> spectators<00:05:08.850> tend<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.240> be<00:05:09.360> clumsy

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
something spectators tend to be clumsy

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.710 
something spectators tend to be clumsy
just<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.320> way<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.530> is<00:05:11.360> they<00:05:12.360> drop<00:05:12.600> more

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
just the way it is they drop more

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.030 
just the way it is they drop more
something<00:05:12.990> they<00:05:13.050> might<00:05:13.080> reveal<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.530> face<00:05:13.830> up

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
something they might reveal that face up

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.010 
something they might reveal that face up
bases<00:05:14.400> on<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.550> bottom<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.600> could<00:05:15.780> kind<00:05:15.960> of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
bases on the bottom that could kind of

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.870 
bases on the bottom that could kind of
give<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.169> trick<00:05:16.470> away<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.650> little<00:05:16.830> bit<00:05:16.979> then

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
give the trick away a little bit then

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.300 
give the trick away a little bit then
you<00:05:17.910> do<00:05:18.150> need<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.390> give<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.750> dick<00:05:19.100> one<00:05:20.100> more

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
you do need to give the dick one more

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.310 
you do need to give the dick one more
cut<00:05:20.490> because<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:20.820> saw<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.180> face<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:22.020> face<00:05:22.169> on

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
cut because you saw this face to face on

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.409 
cut because you saw this face to face on
the<00:05:22.380> bottom<00:05:22.620> here<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:23.820> complete<00:05:24.120> everything

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
the bottom here to complete everything

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.450 
the bottom here to complete everything
now<00:05:25.080> everything<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.560> set<00:05:25.770> up<00:05:25.800> for<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.160> reveal

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
now everything is set up for the reveal

this you're no danger of mess or

this you're no danger of mess or
anything<00:06:00.210> up<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.020> only<00:06:01.110> think<00:06:01.320> it

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
anything up this is the only think it

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.590 
anything up this is the only think it
happen<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:01.890> if<00:06:02.610> you<00:06:02.700> do<00:06:02.820> too<00:06:03.000> many<00:06:03.210> every<00:06:03.450> once

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
happen is if you do too many every once

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.790 
happen is if you do too many every once
in<00:06:03.720> while<00:06:03.750> you<00:06:03.900> walk<00:06:04.020> upright<00:06:04.470> one<00:06:04.650> of<00:06:04.740> the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
in while you walk upright one of the

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.950 
in while you walk upright one of the
mesas<00:06:05.190> that<00:06:05.850> happened<00:06:06.210> just<00:06:06.330> say<00:06:06.479> well<00:06:06.780> we'll

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
mesas that happened just say well we'll

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.100 
mesas that happened just say well we'll
just<00:06:06.990> cut<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:07.620> back<00:06:07.800> in

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
just cut that back in

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.530 
just cut that back in
Center<00:06:08.410> and<00:06:08.560> move<00:06:08.710> on<00:06:08.890> it<00:06:09.760> does<00:06:09.970> detract<00:06:10.390> a

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
Center and move on it does detract a

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.840 
Center and move on it does detract a
little<00:06:11.080> bit<00:06:11.230> from<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.470> trick<00:06:11.830> I<00:06:11.980> think<00:06:12.280> but

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
little bit from the trick I think but

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.150 
little bit from the trick I think but
it's<00:06:13.750> not<00:06:14.080> that<00:06:14.350> big<00:06:14.530> a<00:06:14.590> deal<00:06:14.680> if<00:06:14.920> it<00:06:14.980> does

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
it's not that big a deal if it does

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.680 
it's not that big a deal if it does
happen<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.700> it<00:06:15.790> doesn't<00:06:16.090> happen<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:16.390> often

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
happen and it doesn't happen that often

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.630 
happen and it doesn't happen that often
especially<00:06:17.680> if<00:06:17.920> you<00:06:17.980> don't<00:06:18.130> cut<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.370> cards

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
especially if you don't cut the cards

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.560 
especially if you don't cut the cards
too<00:06:18.820> many<00:06:19.000> times<00:06:20.970> but<00:06:21.970> that's<00:06:22.090> all<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.450> have

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
too many times but that's all you have

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.210 
too many times but that's all you have
to<00:06:22.690> do<00:06:22.780> with<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.050> for<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.620> trick<00:06:23.890> and<00:06:24.100> then

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
to do with you for the trick and then

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.610 
to do with you for the trick and then
you<00:06:24.370> can<00:06:24.520> reveal<00:06:24.850> oops<00:06:25.540> however<00:06:26.320> you<00:06:26.410> like

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
you can reveal oops however you like

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.860 
you can reveal oops however you like
that<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.490> Queen's<00:06:28.330> have<00:06:28.510> switched<00:06:28.780> places

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
it right back to the top like so oops

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.890 
it right back to the top like so oops
when<00:07:07.240> I<00:07:07.300> put<00:07:07.480> these<00:07:07.630> on<00:07:07.810> here<00:07:08.080> I<00:07:08.460> catch<00:07:09.460> a<00:07:09.580> break

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
when I put these on here I catch a break

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.030 
when I put these on here I catch a break
and<00:07:10.900> then<00:07:11.410> i<00:07:11.500> do<00:07:11.560> a<00:07:11.950> double<00:07:12.310> under<00:07:12.610> pet<00:07:14.040> and

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040 
and then i do a double under pet and

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.040 
and then i do a double under pet and
their<00:07:15.400> cars<00:07:15.640> right<00:07:15.910> back<00:07:16.060> on<00:07:16.180> the<00:07:16.270> top<00:07:16.480> so<00:07:16.960> if

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
their cars right back on the top so if

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.930 
their cars right back on the top so if
you<00:07:17.140> need<00:07:17.290> to<00:07:17.380> control<00:07:17.710> a<00:07:17.860> card<00:07:18.250> to<00:07:18.460> the<00:07:18.550> top<00:07:18.760> of

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
you need to control a card to the top of

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.990
