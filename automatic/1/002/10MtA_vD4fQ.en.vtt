guys about a game that I like to play a
lot<00:00:11.400> recently<00:00:11.969> especially<00:00:12.780> with<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.200> son<00:00:13.650> and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
lot recently especially with my son and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.420 
lot recently especially with my son and
that<00:00:14.089> is<00:00:15.089> Train<00:00:15.900> Frontier<00:00:16.440> Express<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.900> as

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
that is Train Frontier Express and as

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.540 
that is Train Frontier Express and as
you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.150> basically<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.350> model<00:00:23.310> train

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you can see it's basically a model train

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.200 
you can see it's basically a model train
simulator<00:00:24.260> for<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.410> computer<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.970> not

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
simulator for your computer but like not

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.080 
simulator for your computer but like not
a<00:00:27.240> model<00:00:27.920> like<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:29.910> cool

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
a model like you can it's really cool

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
a model like you can it's really cool
because<00:00:30.240> oh<00:00:30.449> yeah<00:00:30.630> here's<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> car<00:00:31.140> -<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> can

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
because oh yeah here's the car - you can

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
because oh yeah here's the car - you can
drive<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> car<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:33.140> basically<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> same

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
drive a car in this basically the same

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.340 
drive a car in this basically the same
as<00:00:34.649> grand<00:00:34.920> theft<00:00:35.070> auto<00:00:35.809> except<00:00:36.809> maybe<00:00:37.110> the

as grand theft auto except maybe the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.760 
as grand theft auto except maybe the
physics<00:00:37.739> aren't<00:00:39.649> you<00:00:40.649> know<00:00:41.120> realistic<00:00:42.770> it's

and but you can like you can place your

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
and but you can like you can place your
tracks<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.480> make<00:00:48.960> them

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
tracks you can you know make them

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
tracks you can you know make them
however<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> build<00:00:50.219> little

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
doodads right here on building a power

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.810 
doodads right here on building a power
station<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.160> cool<00:00:53.370> wanted<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
station which is pretty cool wanted to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
station which is pretty cool wanted to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
crash this train over and over and over
again<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> may<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.320> asking<00:01:55.710> yourself
