worried<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> site<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> pictures<00:01:01.649> almost

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
worried on the site the pictures almost

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
worried on the site the pictures almost
looked<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> letter<00:01:02.850> looked<00:01:03.120> weird<00:01:03.359> but

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
looked like the letter looked weird but

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
looked like the letter looked weird but
didn't<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.619> leather<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
didn't look like the leather and the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.350 
didn't look like the leather and the
other<00:01:05.250> picture<00:01:05.519> shoe<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> thought<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.270> would

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
other picture shoe so I thought it would

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820 
other picture shoe so I thought it would
be<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> crappy<00:01:07.020> suede<00:01:07.260> leather<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.710> these

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
be that crappy suede leather but these

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
be that crappy suede leather but these
are<00:01:07.979> genuine<00:01:08.520> leather<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> tell<00:01:09.270> they're

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
are genuine leather you can tell they're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.570 
are genuine leather you can tell they're
really<00:01:10.350> nice-looking

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
really nice-looking

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.870 
I like the black on black actually I
think<00:01:13.680> better<00:01:13.950> than<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.189> black<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.549> silver

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
think better than the black on silver

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.219 
think better than the black on silver
just<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:15.930> black

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
light really cool no no I like these a

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:13.350

lot

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
lot

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.809 
lot
I<00:05:13.389> probably<00:05:14.319> will<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.979> don't<00:05:15.160> know<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.460> probably

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
I probably will I don't know I probably

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.370 
I probably will I don't know I probably
wear<00:05:16.060> socks<00:05:16.330> with<00:05:16.449> them<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.930> don't<00:05:17.110> know<00:05:17.199> if<00:05:17.289> I

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
wear socks with them I don't know if I

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.100 
wear socks with them I don't know if I
like<00:05:17.530> I<00:05:17.710> like<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.039> barefoot<00:05:18.460> too<00:05:18.669> but<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.270> think

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
like I like the barefoot too but I think

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.870 
like I like the barefoot too but I think
the<00:05:20.229> sides<00:05:20.440> will<00:05:20.650> have<00:05:20.800> more<00:05:20.949> color<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:21.639> but

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
the sides will have more color to it but

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.320 
the sides will have more color to it but
this<00:05:22.479> has<00:05:22.630> a<00:05:22.660> lot<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:23.580> interesting<00:05:24.580> colors<00:05:24.970> too

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
this has a lot of interesting colors too

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.629 
this has a lot of interesting colors too
I<00:05:25.599> think<00:05:26.319> with<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> black<00:05:26.889> sock<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.550> would

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
I think with a black sock it would

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.450 
I think with a black sock it would
definitely<00:05:28.090> be<00:05:28.840> more<00:05:29.080> intense<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.220> color

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
definitely be more intense of a color

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.400 
definitely be more intense of a color
versus<00:05:30.970> coming<00:05:31.150> off<00:05:31.330> as<00:05:31.509> like<00:05:31.690> share<00:05:32.020> with<00:05:32.229> the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
versus coming off as like share with the

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.860 
versus coming off as like share with the
color<00:05:32.680> change<00:05:33.150> either<00:05:34.150> way<00:05:34.509> it's<00:05:34.750> pretty

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
color change either way it's pretty

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:43.610 
color change either way it's pretty
cool-looking

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.439 

they<00:05:44.620> have<00:05:44.740> little<00:05:45.030> ventilation<00:05:46.030> holes<00:05:46.240> on

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
they have little ventilation holes on

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.899 
they have little ventilation holes on
the<00:05:46.539> inside<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.199> plastic<00:05:47.610> for<00:05:48.610> your<00:05:48.699> feet

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
the inside of the plastic for your feet

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.550 
the inside of the plastic for your feet
to<00:05:49.060> get<00:05:49.210> air<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.389> suppose<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:50.229> they<00:05:50.319> don't<00:05:50.470> get

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
to get air I suppose so they don't get

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.010 
to get air I suppose so they don't get
also<00:05:50.889> idea<00:05:51.099> that's<00:05:51.280> kind<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.490> interesting<00:05:52.020> and

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
also idea that's kind of interesting and

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.210 
also idea that's kind of interesting and
I<00:05:53.349> don't<00:05:53.470> know<00:05:53.560> it's<00:05:53.680> just<00:05:53.740> really<00:05:53.889> cool<00:05:54.159> to

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
I don't know it's just really cool to

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.980 
I don't know it's just really cool to
kind<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.520> see<00:05:54.669> where<00:05:54.819> your<00:05:54.970> foot<00:05:55.270> sits<00:05:55.569> and<00:05:55.900> I
