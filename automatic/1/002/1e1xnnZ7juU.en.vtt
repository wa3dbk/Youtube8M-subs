they<00:00:18.029> did<00:00:18.240> drop<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> galaxy<00:00:19.050> named<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.529> their

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
they did drop the galaxy named for their

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
they did drop the galaxy named for their
wearables<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.420> maybe<00:00:21.420> primarily<00:00:21.869> that's<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
wearables and maybe primarily that's the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
wearables and maybe primarily that's the
reason<00:00:22.680> why<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.369> running

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
reason why is because it's not running

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.009 
reason why is because it's not running
an<00:00:23.730> Android<00:00:24.029> iteration<00:00:24.390> anymore<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.869> is

get those notifications from so let's

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.550 
get those notifications from so let's
take<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> look<00:02:38.660> at<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> actual<00:02:39.110> functionality

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
take a look at the actual functionality

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.289 
take a look at the actual functionality
of<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> fit<00:02:40.190> itself<00:02:40.700> I'm<00:02:40.850> not<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> put

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
of the fit itself I'm not going to put

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.210 
of the fit itself I'm not going to put
it<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.660> time<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.380> told<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.100> before

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
it on this time but as I told you before

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.030 
it on this time but as I told you before
if<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.670> have<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.090> your<00:02:44.269> wrist<00:02:44.739> like<00:02:45.739> say

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
if you have it on your wrist like say

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.970 
if you have it on your wrist like say
right<00:02:46.880> here<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.420> find<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.170> little<00:02:48.410> bit<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:48.860> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
right here I find it a little bit just a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.680 
right here I find it a little bit just a
little<00:02:49.010> bit<00:02:49.250> odd<00:02:49.489> because<00:02:49.700> you're<00:02:50.360> if<00:02:50.540> you're

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
little bit odd because you're if you're

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.449 
little bit odd because you're if you're
looking<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.140> way<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:52.040> kind<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:52.400> to

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
looking this way you kind of have to

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.070 
looking this way you kind of have to
look<00:02:52.580> at<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.850> at<00:02:52.910> an<00:02:53.030> angle<00:02:53.480> it's<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.780> little<00:02:53.989> bit

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
look at it at an angle it's a little bit

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.220 
look at it at an angle it's a little bit
odd<00:02:54.610> ultimately<00:02:55.610> especially<00:02:56.330> especially<00:02:56.750> if

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
odd ultimately especially especially if

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.170 
odd ultimately especially especially if
you're<00:02:57.350> working<00:02:57.560> out<00:02:57.830> maybe<00:02:58.160> not<00:02:58.370> wearing<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
you're working out maybe not wearing it

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.270 
you're working out maybe not wearing it
like<00:02:59.330> this<00:02:59.510> all<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.870> time<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:00.890> probably

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
like this all the time I would probably

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.000 
like this all the time I would probably
prefer<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:03.140> bottom<00:03:03.350> portion<00:03:03.709> of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
prefer it to be on the bottom portion of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.740 
prefer it to be on the bottom portion of
my<00:03:04.190> wrist<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.760> could<00:03:05.030> lift<00:03:05.180> my<00:03:05.360> hand<00:03:05.570> up

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
my wrist so that I could lift my hand up

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.180 
my wrist so that I could lift my hand up
and<00:03:05.900> look<00:03:05.989> at<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.500> way<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.890> seems<00:03:07.100> a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
and look at it this way it seems a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.150 
and look at it this way it seems a
little<00:03:07.280> bit<00:03:07.459> easier<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.790> me<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.720> fashion

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
little bit easier to me in this fashion

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.080 
little bit easier to me in this fashion

and<00:04:36.259> let's<00:04:36.830> see<00:04:36.949> what<00:04:37.099> it<00:04:37.190> is<00:04:37.250> it's<00:04:37.460> probably

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
and let's see what it is it's probably

Oh<00:04:38.000> 80<00:04:38.569> right<00:04:38.810> now<00:04:38.990> well<00:04:39.199> I<00:04:39.409> did<00:04:39.680> have<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.830> bit<00:04:39.979> of

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
Oh 80 right now well I did have a bit of

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.379 
Oh 80 right now well I did have a bit of
a<00:04:40.099> break<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.580> looks<00:04:40.729> like<00:04:40.789> my<00:04:41.030> heart<00:04:41.240> rate

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
a break so it looks like my heart rate

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.460 
a break so it looks like my heart rate
is<00:04:41.509> a<00:04:41.539> little<00:04:41.599> bit<00:04:41.810> more<00:04:41.900> normal<00:04:42.259> at<00:04:42.349> this

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
is a little bit more normal at this

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.439 
is a little bit more normal at this
point<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.069> ultimately<00:04:43.759> it's<00:04:44.000> just<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.210> really

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
point and ultimately it's just a really

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.790 
point and ultimately it's just a really
nice<00:04:44.599> companion<00:04:45.139> for<00:04:45.259> all<00:04:45.289> those<00:04:45.500> times<00:04:45.710> that

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
nice companion for all those times that

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
you're going to be working out either

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.850 
you're going to be working out either
running<00:04:47.300> jogging<00:04:47.599> or<00:04:47.870> otherwise<00:04:48.229> but<00:04:48.740> it's

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
running jogging or otherwise but it's

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.930 
running jogging or otherwise but it's
also<00:04:48.949> something<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:49.520> might<00:04:49.699> want<00:04:49.759> to

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940

keep<00:04:50.120> on<00:04:50.330> because<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.349> is<00:04:51.710> rather<00:04:52.400> thin<00:04:53.030> it's

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
keep on because it is rather thin it's

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.960 
keep on because it is rather thin it's
not<00:04:53.720> too<00:04:53.870> thick<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:54.259> it<00:04:54.710> allows<00:04:55.039> you<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.520> just
