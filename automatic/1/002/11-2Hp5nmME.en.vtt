00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
has fixed this first off when I got my I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
has fixed this first off when I got my I
look<00:00:50.309> camera<00:00:51.469> all<00:00:52.469> three<00:00:53.039> switches<00:00:54.110> down<00:00:55.110> here

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
look camera all three switches down here

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
look camera all three switches down here
were<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> left<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.430> believe<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.180> was

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
were to the left and I believe that was

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.700 
were to the left and I believe that was
on<00:01:00.629> channel<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:02.449> according<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> was

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
on channel one according to what I was

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
on channel one according to what I was
able<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> read<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> instructions<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
able to read on the instructions so I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.609 
able to read on the instructions so I
moved<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.100> three<00:01:08.729> switches<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> right

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
moved all three switches to the right

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.570 
moved all three switches to the right
which<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.640> channel<00:01:12.150> 8<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:16.159> as<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.520> see

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
which is channel 8 now as you can see

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.749 
which is channel 8 now as you can see
even<00:01:18.090> though<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> Channel<00:01:18.840> eight<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.759> am

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
even though it's on Channel eight I am

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
even though it's on Channel eight I am
still<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.509> getting<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.229> GPS<00:01:23.100> lock<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> here's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
still not getting a GPS lock so here's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
still not getting a GPS lock so here's
what<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.880> Channel<00:01:27.270> I
