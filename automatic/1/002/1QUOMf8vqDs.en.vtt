00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
and it's like a six-hour thing where

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.310 
and it's like a six-hour thing where
basically<00:04:44.740> they<00:04:45.010> give<00:04:45.280> him<00:04:45.580> dairy<00:04:46.270> um<00:04:47.229> a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
basically they give him dairy um a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.339 
basically they give him dairy um a
little<00:04:48.010> bit<00:04:48.099> of<00:04:48.280> dairy<00:04:48.460> like<00:04:48.820> every<00:04:49.570> 20

little bit of dairy like every 20
minutes<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.740> think<00:04:50.800> they<00:04:51.550> start<00:04:51.820> off<00:04:51.880> with<00:04:52.000> like

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
minutes I think they start off with like

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.879 
minutes I think they start off with like
a<00:04:52.150> powder<00:04:52.479> form<00:04:52.900> it's<00:04:53.470> like<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.710> dairy

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
a powder form it's like the dairy

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.529 
a powder form it's like the dairy
protein<00:04:54.400> or<00:04:54.520> something<00:04:54.550> like<00:04:54.789> that<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.150> end

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
protein or something like that and end

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.060 
protein or something like that and end
the<00:04:55.720> day<00:04:55.840> with<00:04:56.020> like<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.199> glass<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.560> milk

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
the day with like a glass of milk

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.850 
the day with like a glass of milk
and<00:04:57.430> if<00:04:58.389> he<00:04:58.570> passes<00:04:59.110> this<00:04:59.229> challenge<00:04:59.710> that

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
and if he passes this challenge that

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.219 
and if he passes this challenge that
