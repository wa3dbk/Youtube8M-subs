 quintana 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.060
 everyone 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 Yes Yes 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.679
 I also 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.229
 for a year 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.579
 acp 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.579

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.760
 the Catalan singer-songwriter also singer brown 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.890
 during the act 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 tulcan 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.370
 I think it is the opportunity to dispute a new dimension to the work of the 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.750
 Pacific music 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.110
 and it seems to me that the pair is interesting from this this special encounter that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.950
 does the marimba which has a strong pedagogical component that the idea of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.010
 want people to learn that it's not just about the party but that 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.869
 party has a series of things a context that is important to know 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 As the secretary said it was definitely not a thing of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.080
 black and white but that all of us here are from the Pacific and there 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 we have to identify ourselves as such 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.299
 Yellen believes that in October 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.920
 The file 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.140
 apparently four of cc oo 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 in four months in the instance they can not see but the book did not find 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 the way 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.750
 spout 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.410
 with everything 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.630
 a - clear with everything so much bravo 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 torrico 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.490
 the method is looking to skip having to use a writing to 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.200
 through pentagram and that kind of thing and disarm many elements that 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.520
 traditionally use not only sailors and musicians can 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.749
 shops where the singers 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.119
 for that reason resources to agree on the hand 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:24.569
 the key is how to make a special demarcation in the marimba 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.359
 i of two groups of tables the so far is as related in two 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.439
 groups based on that following a series like rules can be a 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 way one can interpret the marimba de chonta the marimba de chonta for me 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.299
 means another a new dimension of music I studied in the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.379
 conservatory is common common percussionist but 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.169
 definitely what you learn with the marimba de chonta and with the 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.390
 Traditional music does not mention any part precisely that 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.229
 live music situation 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:56.349
 and for me it means the opportunity to participate since then we dedicate 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.779
 I have been told by the academy that the music is peaceful and 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.150
 can right now address in favor of an event like this 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:09.119
 shocking 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:13.649
 Occasionally people will be encouraged by the fact that the marina can be touched 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.539
 that you can not appropriate it 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.919
 and the idea is that everyone who comes to the workshops alleges playing the marimba and 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.989
 not only did the party take away, but that music was interested in the interior 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.169
 is 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.519
 coc 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.939
 A) Yes 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.939
 10 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:40.699
