00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.840 
I'm the only bad thing I would have to
say<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.190> come<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.640> to

say about this is when you come down to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.550 
say about this is when you come down to
the<00:01:29.940> ingredients<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> first<00:01:31.080> thing<00:01:31.409> that's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the ingredients the first thing that's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
the ingredients the first thing that's
listed<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.100> mineral<00:01:32.340> oil<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.970> I've<00:01:33.420> heard

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
listed is mineral oil and I've heard

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.389 
listed is mineral oil and I've heard
some<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.530> good<00:01:34.649> things<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:34.979> mineral

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
some not so good things about mineral

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.200 
some not so good things about mineral
oil<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> natural<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
oil because it's not a natural or is not

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
oil because it's not a natural or is not
a<00:01:39.270> plant-based<00:01:39.690> oil<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.220> derived<00:01:41.850> from

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a plant-based oil and it's derived from

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.830 
a plant-based oil and it's derived from
petroleum<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.030> best<00:01:45.270> oil<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
petroleum so it's not the best oil to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.069 
petroleum so it's not the best oil to
put<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.259> hair<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.390> those<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.899> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
put on your hair and those can all just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.260 
put on your hair and those can all just
kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.320> sit<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> surface<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.909> hair

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
kind of sit on the surface of your hair

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
kind of sit on the surface of your hair
and<00:01:51.479> it'll<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> same<00:01:52.680> as

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and it'll be kind of the same as

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
and it'll be kind of the same as
wrapping<00:01:53.280> something<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> saran<00:01:54.119> wrap<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
wrapping something and saran wrap so

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
wrapping something and saran wrap so
you'll<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.229> sealing<00:01:55.820> whatever<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> product

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you'll be sealing whatever the product

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
you'll be sealing whatever the product
is<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.439> nothing<00:01:58.680> else<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.399> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
is but then nothing else can get in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
is but then nothing else can get in
so<00:02:00.210> minner<00:02:00.450> already<00:02:00.899> isn't<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> best<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.680> can

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so minner already isn't it best you can

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
so minner already isn't it best you can
google<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> find<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.659> information

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
google it to find more information

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.359 
google it to find more information
because<00:02:04.289> I'm<00:02:04.380> definitely<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.829> expert<00:02:05.280> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
because I'm definitely not expert on

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.539 
moisture oh or you know so I really
don't<00:04:14.960> like<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.620> pour<00:04:15.800> oil<00:04:15.830> on<00:04:16.160> my<00:04:16.310> whole

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
don't like to pour oil on my whole

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.030 
don't like to pour oil on my whole
entire<00:04:16.930> here<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.260> definitely<00:04:18.350> put<00:04:18.860> it<00:04:18.950> on

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
entire here but I definitely put it on

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.310 
entire here but I definitely put it on
my<00:04:19.160> scalp<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.850> like<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.390> far<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:21.290> only

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
my scalp and I like it so far the only

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.430 
my scalp and I like it so far the only
downside<00:04:22.040> about<00:04:22.070> this<00:04:22.580> product<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.440> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
downside about this product is the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.760 
downside about this product is the
application<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.670> just<00:04:25.850> has<00:04:26.000> in<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.240> hole<00:04:26.770> push

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
application it just has in the hole push

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.940 
application it just has in the hole push
top<00:04:28.040> like<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:28.910> if<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.510> have<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.830> know

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
top like that so if you have to you know

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.250 
top like that so if you have to you know
squirt<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.580> on<00:04:31.730> your<00:04:31.850> hand<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.450> rub<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.050> through

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
squirt it on your hand I rub it through

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.860 
squirt it on your hand I rub it through
or<00:04:33.890> this<00:04:34.130> one<00:04:34.340> gives<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.850> option<00:04:35.300> of<00:04:35.450> the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
or this one gives you the option of the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.020 
or this one gives you the option of the
nozzle<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.770> can<00:04:36.920> actually<00:04:37.100> kinda<00:04:37.670> like<00:04:37.790> go

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
nozzle so you can actually kinda like go

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.340 
nozzle so you can actually kinda like go
down<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.690> between<00:04:39.470> parts<00:04:40.250> of<00:04:40.430> your<00:04:40.640> hair<00:04:41.090> and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
down in between parts of your hair and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.430 
down in between parts of your hair and
apply<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:42.890> definitely<00:04:44.440> definitely

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
apply that so I definitely definitely

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.950 
apply that so I definitely definitely
prefer<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.040> nozzle<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:47.030> Talia<00:04:47.570> Brigitte

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
prefer the nozzle on the Talia Brigitte

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.760 
prefer the nozzle on the Talia Brigitte
over<00:04:48.290> this<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:50.150> overall<00:04:50.630> even<00:04:51.260> though<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.560> is

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
over this so overall even though this is

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.740 
over this so overall even though this is
pricier<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:54.790> would<00:04:55.790> probably<00:04:56.030> stick<00:04:56.450> with<00:04:56.630> this

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
pricier I would probably stick with this

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.670 
pricier I would probably stick with this
for<00:04:56.810> now<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:58.520> don't<00:04:58.580> have<00:04:58.820> any<00:04:58.970> any<00:04:59.680> serious

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
for now and I don't have any any serious

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.980 
for now and I don't have any any serious
