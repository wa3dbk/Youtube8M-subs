00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.579 

I<00:00:02.720> figure<00:00:03.720> I'll<00:00:03.780> let<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:03.959> guys<00:00:04.080> watch<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.470> end

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I figure I'll let you guys watch the end

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:57.619 
I figure I'll let you guys watch the end
of<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.740> print<00:00:55.730> I'll<00:00:56.730> sure<00:00:56.910> boss<00:00:57.090> probably

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of this print I'll sure boss probably

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
of this print I'll sure boss probably
mention<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> reasons<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
mention as well one of the reasons I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.040 
mention as well one of the reasons I
print<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.910> coins<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.780> easy

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
print this coins because it's very easy

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.229 
print this coins because it's very easy
to<00:01:01.199> measure<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> calibrate<00:01:02.219> since<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.940> change

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to measure and calibrate since I change

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
to measure and calibrate since I change
the<00:01:03.449> belt<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.049> machine<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.710> only<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the belt on this machine the only the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
the belt on this machine the only the
white<00:01:05.430> belt<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.880> had<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> recalibrate<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
white belt I had to recalibrate it and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.010 
white belt I had to recalibrate it and
when<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.640> change<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.180> steps<00:01:09.900> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
when you do that you change the steps it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
when you do that you change the steps it
needs<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> take<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.250> coin<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.549> really

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
needs to take and this coin is really

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
needs to take and this coin is really
good<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
good for that because it's you know it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.990 
good for that because it's you know it
should<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.860> flat<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.340> sides<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
should be flat on all sides and the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 
should be flat on all sides and the
teardrop<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.600> come<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:15.930> much<00:01:16.170> different<00:01:16.650> if

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
teardrop will come out much different if

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
teardrop will come out much different if
it<00:01:16.860> wasn't<00:01:17.130> calibrated<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.090> i<00:01:18.150> went<00:01:18.270> ahead<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it wasn't calibrated so i went ahead and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
it wasn't calibrated so i went ahead and
refined<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.380> walk<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> x<00:01:20.310> axis<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
refined the walk the x axis as well and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.859 
refined the walk the x axis as well and
i<00:01:21.270> went<00:01:21.750> ahead<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.930> reset<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> y<00:01:24.060> axis<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
i went ahead and reset the the y axis so

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.149 
i went ahead and reset the the y axis so
they<00:01:24.990> should<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.350> different<00:01:25.439> values<00:01:25.890> with

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
they should be two different values with

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
they should be two different values with
two<00:01:26.490> different<00:01:26.640> belts<00:01:27.770> theoretically<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
two different belts theoretically they

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530 
two different belts theoretically they
should<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> same<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> same<00:01:30.180> belt

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
should be the same if it's the same belt

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
should be the same if it's the same belt
but<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.229> always<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.310> always

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
but that's not always the case so always

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
but that's not always the case so always
measure<00:01:32.939> Andrea<00:01:33.329> measure<00:01:33.509> develops<00:01:33.930> over

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
measure Andrea measure develops over

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.690 
measure Andrea measure develops over
time<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.439> might<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> settling<00:01:35.430> in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
time you might have a way of settling in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
time you might have a way of settling in
so<00:01:36.390> yeah<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.110> idea<00:01:37.229> every<00:01:37.560> once<00:01:37.740> every

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so yeah it's good idea every once every

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.999 
so yeah it's good idea every once every
couple<00:01:39.210> weeks<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.750> recalibrate<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.619> machine

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
couple weeks to recalibrate your machine

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.350 
couple weeks to recalibrate your machine
just<00:01:41.130> make<00:01:41.369> sure<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.880> tip-top<00:01:42.150> shape

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
just make sure it's in tip-top shape

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.160 
just make sure it's in tip-top shape
this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> major<00:01:43.710> gear<00:01:44.100> plus<00:01:45.030> traitor<00:01:45.479> will

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
this is a major gear plus traitor will

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.490 
this is a major gear plus traitor will
meet<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.619> hot<00:01:46.799> end<00:01:47.009> point<00:01:47.369> 35<00:01:47.790> on

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
meet with your hot end point 35 on

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.730 
meet with your hot end point 35 on

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.920 

there<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:02.270> it's<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.540> looks<00:04:04.110> pretty<00:04:04.320> good

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
there it is it's a looks pretty good

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.390 
there it is it's a looks pretty good
just<00:04:06.930> as<00:04:07.080> good<00:04:07.200> I'm<00:04:07.740> like<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.070> would<00:04:08.250> say<00:04:08.370> just

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
just as good I'm like I would say just

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.170 
just as good I'm like I would say just
as<00:04:08.730> good<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:10.100> actual<00:04:11.100> geometry<00:04:11.550> that's

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
as good on the actual geometry that's

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.330 
as good on the actual geometry that's
perfectly<00:04:12.660> symmetrical<00:04:13.320> don't<00:04:14.010> see<00:04:14.190> any

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
perfectly symmetrical don't see any

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.940 
perfectly symmetrical don't see any
calibration<00:04:14.610> problems<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:16.440> layers<00:04:16.709> are<00:04:16.920> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
calibration problems the layers are a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.170 
calibration problems the layers are a
lot<00:04:17.070> thinner<00:04:17.280> because<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> thinner

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
lot thinner because this is a thinner

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.660 
lot thinner because this is a thinner
nozzle<00:04:18.920> some<00:04:19.920> end<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.220> sudden<00:04:20.549> the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
nozzle some end of the sudden the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.099 
nozzle some end of the sudden the
infield<00:04:21.000> can<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.269> some<00:04:21.480> work<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:21.930> that's

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
infield can have some work but that's

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.520 
infield can have some work but that's
not<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.290> big<00:04:22.440> deal<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:22.860> all<00:04:23.010> software<00:04:24.200> okay<00:04:25.200> so

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
not a big deal it's all software okay so

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.660 
not a big deal it's all software okay so
there<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.800> actually<00:04:26.010> designed<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.490> coin

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
there it is actually designed that coin

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.160 
there it is actually designed that coin
is<00:04:26.760> something<00:04:27.120> worse<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.570> can<00:04:27.720> download<00:04:27.840> and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
is something worse you can download and

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.380 
is something worse you can download and
print<00:04:28.230> yourself
