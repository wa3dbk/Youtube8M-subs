00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.910
 duty and the theater until 13 August 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.320
 This is the watch that I have chosen and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.869
 brown branches and a rose colt 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 yes everyone I say and I find one 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.549
 power oh it's really a timeless 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 watch because I'm stuck finger 10 a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.330
 thing is not a classic class you can see 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 where I can really do it for a very long time 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.939
 to turn 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.119
 there is still a protective cover on it 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.619
 I 'm going to take it off 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 I have the protection to eventually 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.049
 done very carefully 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.329
 of course 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.680
 And so this is how big a closed one is 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.960
 I'll leave you a few too 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.240
 see pictures that I have him on I think 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 him really super beautiful and I am really very 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.479
 very happy with it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 I'm also really assuring me I am 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.890
 I don't think this will go with school either 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.290
 I wear it because I'm afraid I'm there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 for a listener under roll 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 drop because words shoot lodges 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960
 among them we're on so I'm afraid that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.579
 when i get him outside we score high 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 left leaf fall I'm really a mess 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.869
 and stuff like that so I guess this one 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 yes now the holidays i can do him very much 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.149
 are going to wear 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.299
 let me name him, I will not 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.530

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.590
