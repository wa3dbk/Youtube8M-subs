00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.100
 this video is sponsored by copy 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.510
 jones 4 the application that allows you to 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.070
 transfer the content of your idevice 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.750
 to your computer 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.190
 hello his ipod touch taxes and 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.990
 today I want to show calm to 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.190
 hide the remaining houston on the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.720
 springboard of your device 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.160
 so of course with this method you 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.510
 do not need to be managed even break 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.849
 if you are a lighter it works 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.710
 also and all that it's going to do its 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.599
 crates held a stand by default one can 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.730
 not put it in a folder so we 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.080
 sees that he really not reassured he wants 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.580
 really not going into a folder wants 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.750
 really stay on spring flight he's going 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.520
 have privileges that others 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.160
 applications not pau then we will remove 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.300
 this privilege of houston so everything 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.590
 what to do first 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.180
 works on any device 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.399
 any black fact we do not have 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.750
 need to be managed lighter so yes that 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.030
 works on the iphone 5 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 so for those who have a windows mac 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.440
 it works if it will just run 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.820
 an application click on a button 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.530
 connected idevice note and it's going 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.000
 run everything that's going to do that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.949
 will maintain this theme in a folder and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.600
 we will see them how to do so 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.450
 the mac windows application is available 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.730
 to hide the new style so no time as 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.590
 it's called stephen stand 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.509
 so we walk to mac links 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.150
 are in the description of the video is 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.619
 just to tell you that there was a bug 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.460
 which was found in the windows version 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.409
 in version 1.0 mails the 1.0.1 it's 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.150
 that for iphone 5 it does not work 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.100
 when you are on windows 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.680
 if you are on mac it will work 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.570
 number one to hide the houston 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.890
 but for the windows version that 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.030
 not work so this is why I 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.990
 directly shows since my 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.640
 iphone 4 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.960
 so after that what is needed 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.490
 to do is if you are surely in 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.189
 I do a right click and you do 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.110
 run as administrator by 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.540
 the following once executed does yes well 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.159
 sure allegations and subsequently a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.909
 little window will appear like that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.590
 this 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.380
 so it goes from elsewhere there is detected 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.670
 your iphone 4 os 6.0 and it would take 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.250
 just click on hyde 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.689

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.340

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.650
