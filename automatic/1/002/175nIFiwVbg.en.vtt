00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.050
 I have been to or to the past few days 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.389
 in this group on the radio on TV yesterday 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.379
 of suffering not from the dutch disease 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.120
 but we keep saying that we actually 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.540
 were better to keep revenge 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.170
 but we don't want what's in that light 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.050
 viewed 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.270
 your conclusion after last night after you 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.650
 not much to that possession and it 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.939
 good football I think 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.130
 Sure I might go on 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.420
 man on an international level than must 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.550
 you also look elsewhere and 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.470
 school results that she is at all then 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.849
 he started with all you calm down 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.379
 analyze why or result not 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.440
 worked 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.790
 why the result has been achieved yes we 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.250
 did not actually score themselves and 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.280
 then you make it then you make it too 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.580
 then you also make it difficult 'with 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.409
 and whether and of course your stupid 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.210
 errors in fact probably all been very 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.150
 unnecessary actually only yes we have 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.070
 it itself done then the conclusion is 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.000
 that you go off how you look at you 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.100
 perspective in this group yes is still possible 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.939
 in all directions actually and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.250
 but i think if you have a good result 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.960
 had yesterday you very far 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.640
 I think and that was not achieved and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.370
 maybe that is possible at the last minute 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.770
 quite crucial and yes but you 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.020
 can not look back so yes you 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.370
 must look ahead and yes you know what you are 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.480
 that awaits in the group and that 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.550
 is just the next trip inside 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.720
 And with that I also think they are via or 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.610
 not 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.400
 yes it's called home games so yes we 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.170
 just have to be yes i think if we like there 4 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.120
 4 points from two matches make it 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.950
 be very far but yes you just have to 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.830
 make sure you are new to winning 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.020
 a group and see what will happen 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.880
 then if you have that against cambuur 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.720
 played 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.640
 remember this at all 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.740
 sma i ca n't remember him anymore but it was 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.570
 if only i was there when i left 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 I didn't even have it before I left 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.430
 played plays like with second division 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.900
 yes it is a while back yes am 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.270
 you lover of artificial grass you would 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.380
 say with your technical truths of 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.670
 may or may not 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.370
 well i don't have problems with it that often 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
 had thinking as a team have one 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.000
 past difficult on artificial turf 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.680
 but he must not be an excuse yesterday 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.150
 also on a very bad field 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.800
 have played 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.010
 so yes that you should apologize for it 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.870
 just stand Sunday and we stand we stand 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.850
 in the competition still not why 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.440
 so we know what to do 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.660
 waiting is just there for 3 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.880
 go point without because after all but then 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 you have been part of a team 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.400
 that one did well in the Netherlands 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.530
 koeman became second 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.140
 do you have any indication where it is at this 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.209
 team is capable of it is hard to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.000
 say you know i can tell that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.890
 that we just have a team what just 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.709
 anyway you can turn at the top 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.930
 I think we have proven that and yes we have 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.100
 its actually that you actually yes almost 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.160
 never actually played away except 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.230
 you guys so that late i was in 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.630
 how far hoofs are and that we 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.250
 just can win competitions and the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.230
 Dutch competition so yes we have to 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.970

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.970
