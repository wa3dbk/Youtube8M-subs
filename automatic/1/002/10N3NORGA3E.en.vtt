00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.819
 all welcome to my channel in this 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.149
 video I'm going to show you how to do kick 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.599
 buttowski 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.929
 look how cute how nice cute 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.929
 symmetry 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.130
 first we're going to need a ball of 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.529
 color to make the body of our 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.529
 character and we will go wrapping 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.460
 a lot of patience until you get a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.310
 We are going to need two skewer sticks 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.970
 they can be and we're going to start them 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.580
 remain the same for 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.580
 make the legs of our actions 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.570
 let's wrap the plastic thing 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.660
 white color on the legs to make 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 We will integrate the legs to the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.590
 rest of the body 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.670
 for the buttocks we use a little ball 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.200
 crushed and we're going to paste it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.659
 the back 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.009
 if they have enough test here in 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.229
 somewhere 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.530
 let's go integrating it with the rest 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 of the body 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 for the feet we will need the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.070
 aspirin yellow color and let's do 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.450
 some species of dimensions that we are going to paste 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 in the chopsticks that we had if they are given 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.610
 account in the bottom part stands out 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.560
 a part of the toothpick that we had 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.409
 introduced and this we do to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.229
 purpose out then nail our 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.320
 character in the base that we are going to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.320
 do 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.050
 we also need a styrofoam ball to 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.490
 head and we will cover it with 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.490
 plasticine in skin color 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 let's make some basins 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.900
 i 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.590
 in this way and then we're going to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 introduce a flattened ball of color 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.060
 white to make the eyes 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.870
 to make the cheek we use another 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.610
 little bit of the skin-colored aspirin and 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.440
 we're going to plan a bit and there the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.069
 integrating with the rest 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.950
 of the head of our character 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.230
 with the bodies we do exactly what 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.590
 same 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.590
 integrating everything 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.840
 and we are going to make some holes in the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.760
 eyes where we will introduce 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.760
 later a colored ball 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.099
 that we are going to flatten 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.730
 with a crushed 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.020
 and then we are going to place a ball of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.020
 White color 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.480
 in the head we put 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.360
 orihuela the white color that is going to 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.790
 be a kind of test is for the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.700
 helmet because the helmet is quite thick 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.500
 it's great then this will help us more 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.610
 shape to the helmet 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.610
 seems good 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.500
 with a cutter let's do the shape of the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.500
 helmet from the front 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.930
 care to cut fingers god 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.299
 and we're going to hit it over the head 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.670
 the back is as wrinkled and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.570
 let's remove the excess plasticine 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:30.180
 with the help of some other material we are going to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.180
 try to smooth scales 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.120
 for the neck let's do 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:45.680
 if the neck was cool to with a cutter 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.440
 and we go measuring and then 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.449
 let's place 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.509
 with lung and we will integrate it 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.840
 to the rest of the body that carries a single 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.840
 piece 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.870
 a red tape we paste from the part of 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.540
 forward of the helmet to the back and 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.540
 we put a slight pressure to add them 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.080
 plus 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.080
 Y 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.240
 let's perfect the part of 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.240
 forward of the helmet 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.979
 to stick it 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.590
 and to make the little fingers of our 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.590
 character used 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.870
 of different sizes 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.560
 and we're going to hit them one by one and 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.330
 year 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.330
 to the rest of the hand 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.920
 someone to tell me why all the 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.150
 people 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.150
 they have four fingers 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.000
 existence the tranquility of my 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.000
 existence 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.259
 i 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:31.019
 and then we go with a little body 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.019
 place your hand on your arm 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.160
 let's make the smile of our 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.650
 character with a little bit of black vinyl 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.960
 a thin-tipped brush with a lot 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.390
 beware you must be very careful in 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.090
 this process if you are wrong 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:58.040
 our character 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.040
 he will have gone to hell 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:05.539
 lies good and then they make a tire 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.210
 a kind of a super easy and then 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.160
 the 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:14.270
 hit the rest 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.270
 of the figure 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:31.199
 with so so so so so so so so 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.850
 relevant in santa elena must push 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:37.850
 total with both a point 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.920
 happy
