hey youtubers this is falling of 90 and
here<00:00:12.090> i<00:00:12.120> am<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.080> entering<00:00:13.830> review<00:00:14.299> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
here i am with a entering review the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.870 
here i am with a entering review the
engine<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> review<00:00:16.350> will<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.010> 284

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
engine in the review will be this 284

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.650 
engine in the review will be this 284
made<00:00:18.390> by<00:00:18.600> Balkman<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.279> siano<00:00:20.970> so

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
made by Balkman and is this siano so

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.970 
made by Balkman and is this siano so
instead<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.960> being<00:00:22.050> called<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.350> berkshire<00:00:22.800> it's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
instead of being called a berkshire it's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.060 
instead of being called a berkshire it's
going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.279> called<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.699> konawa<00:00:24.890> now<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to be called a konawa now if you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.009 
going to be called a konawa now if you
don't<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.460> 284<00:00:27.090> means<00:00:27.300> those<00:00:27.750> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
very slow speeds as you can probably

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.120 
very slow speeds as you can probably
tell<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.970> large<00:01:06.450> locomotive<00:01:07.409> its

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
tell this is a very large locomotive its

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
tell this is a very large locomotive its
primary<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:09.240> pulling<00:01:09.570> heavy<00:01:09.810> loads<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
primary use was pulling heavy loads of

free on the main line of the C&amp;O it is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
free on the main line of the C&amp;O it is
also<00:01:14.070> much<00:01:14.280> larger<00:01:14.640> than<00:01:15.060> most<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.049> other

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
also much larger than most of my other

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
also much larger than most of my other
locomotives<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.549> my<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.880> switcher<00:01:18.360> for

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
locomotives like my little switcher for

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.320 
locomotives like my little switcher for
example<00:01:19.159> take<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.549> compare<00:01:20.759> its<00:01:21.119> eyes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
example take a look and compare its eyes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.550 
example take a look and compare its eyes
as<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.080> appears<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> nowhere<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> say

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
as it appears out of nowhere when I say

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.609 
as it appears out of nowhere when I say
appear<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.450> tell<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.290> entire

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
appear as you can tell the entire

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.030 
appear as you can tell the entire
locomotive<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:30.990> smaller<00:01:31.170> than<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
locomotive is so much smaller than the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.719 
locomotive is so much smaller than the
boiler<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> kanawa<00:01:33.180> right<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:35.490> way

boiler of the kanawa right here that way

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.060 
boiler of the kanawa right here that way
you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.030> definitely<00:01:36.360> indicate<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you can definitely indicate it was not a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
you can definitely indicate it was not a
mainline<00:01:38.850> engine<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.290> for

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
mainline engine it was just for

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
mainline engine it was just for

to<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> Beast<00:01:43.890> over<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.640> which<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.689> used

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to the Beast over here which was used

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.030 
very tight spaces as far as this engine
right<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.720> could<00:02:12.900> probably<00:02:13.140> say

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
right here you could probably say

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.929 
right here you could probably say
about<00:02:14.189> 22<00:02:14.879> inch<00:02:15.269> minimum<00:02:15.959> radius<00:02:16.640> but<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.700> would

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
about 22 inch minimum radius but I would

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.380 
about 22 inch minimum radius but I would
recommend<00:02:18.299> you<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.290> 26<00:02:20.129> or<00:02:20.310> greater<00:02:20.819> if<00:02:21.150> you

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
recommend you go on 26 or greater if you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.800 
recommend you go on 26 or greater if you
want<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.599> make<00:02:21.719> it<00:02:21.870> look<00:02:22.079> a<00:02:22.170> little<00:02:22.319> better

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
want to make it look a little better

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
want to make it look a little better
although<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.959> engine<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.409> not<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> spectrum

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
although the engine is not a spectrum

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.119 
although the engine is not a spectrum
line<00:02:26.579> is<00:02:26.849> still<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.209> Bachman<00:02:27.780> Plus<00:02:28.049> which<00:02:28.920> still

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
line is still a Bachman Plus which still

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.610 
line is still a Bachman Plus which still
means<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.579> still<00:02:29.849> good<00:02:30.030> quality<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:31.470> you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
means it's still good quality and as you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.990 
means it's still good quality and as you
can<00:02:31.769> see<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:31.920> various<00:02:32.489> parts<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.909> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
more realistic here on the tender you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.830 
more realistic here on the tender you

excellent detail and the realistic of
what<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.720> tender<00:02:48.989> was<00:02:49.109> like<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.540> engine<00:02:51.930> does

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
what the tender was like the engine does

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.259 
what the tender was like the engine does

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
reverse however the front headlight will

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.509 
reverse however the front headlight will
not<00:03:03.359> go<00:03:03.629> on<00:03:03.659> when<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.470> engine<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.919> in<00:03:04.980> reverse

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
not go on when the engine is in reverse

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.729 
not go on when the engine is in reverse
I<00:03:05.819> kind<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.480> find<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.780> look<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.169> little

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
I kind of find a look this a little

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.849 
I kind of find a look this a little
unrealistic<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:10.049> engine<00:03:10.349> still<00:03:10.590> very

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
unrealistic but the engine still very

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.869 
unrealistic but the engine still very
good<00:03:12.739> another<00:03:13.739> problem<00:03:13.919> with<00:03:14.189> the<00:03:14.280> locomotive

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
good another problem with the locomotive

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.500 
good another problem with the locomotive
is<00:03:15.000> sort<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.560> realistic<00:03:16.560> accuracy<00:03:17.519> that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
is sort of the realistic accuracy that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.809 
is sort of the realistic accuracy that
Bachmann<00:03:19.019> tries<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.790> while<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
Bachmann tries to have while the

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.289 
Bachmann tries to have while the
locomotives<00:03:21.599> are<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:22.109> good<00:03:22.319> detail<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.790> for

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
locomotives are in good detail and for

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.149 
locomotives are in good detail and for
every<00:03:24.540> engine<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.139> they<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:25.530> there<00:03:25.979> is

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
every engine that they make there is

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.330 
every engine that they make there is
really<00:03:26.579> only<00:03:26.699> one<00:03:27.030> prototype<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:28.319> every<00:03:28.889> model

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
really only one prototype of every model

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.360 
really only one prototype of every model
they<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.669> like<00:03:30.540> take<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.959> 284<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.889> example

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
they have like take this 284 for example

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.939 
they have like take this 284 for example
it<00:03:33.150> says<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.690> builders<00:03:34.049> plate<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.739> was

it says on the builders plate that was

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.890 
it says on the builders plate that was

built by the Lima locomotive works in

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.869 
built by the Lima locomotive works in
march<00:03:37.319> of<00:03:37.500> 1945<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:39.629> real<00:03:40.069> 2760<00:03:41.069> however<00:03:41.400> was

march of 1945 the real 2760 however was

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.490 
march of 1945 the real 2760 however was
built<00:03:42.150> by<00:03:42.329> algo<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.959> 1947<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> for<00:03:45.599> all<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.930> 284

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
built by algo in 1947 so for all the 284

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.979 
built by algo in 1947 so for all the 284
is<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.829> Bachmann<00:03:47.220> released<00:03:47.609> they<00:03:48.510> all<00:03:48.690> have

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
is that Bachmann released they all have

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.839 
is that Bachmann released they all have

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
this builders plate that says those

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.740 
this builders plate that says those
built<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.299> 1945<00:03:52.139> by<00:03:52.709> Lima<00:03:53.129> I'm<00:03:53.909> not<00:03:54.389> exactly

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
built in 1945 by Lima I'm not exactly

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.949 
built in 1945 by Lima I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:54.959> which<00:03:55.560> engine<00:03:56.150> their<00:03:57.150> prototype<00:03:57.689> was

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
sure which engine their prototype was

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.789 
sure which engine their prototype was
that<00:03:58.560> Bachmann<00:03:58.979> made<00:03:59.159> based<00:03:59.699> on<00:03:59.879> all<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.150> them

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
that Bachmann made based on all of them

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.140 
that Bachmann made based on all of them
but<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.949> certainly<00:04:02.159> isn't<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.729> one<00:04:02.970> right

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
but it certainly isn't this one right

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.199 
but it certainly isn't this one right
here<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.079> sort<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.319> takes<00:04:04.530> away<00:04:04.739> the

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
here so it sort of takes away the

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.449 
here so it sort of takes away the
prototypical<00:04:06.209> accuracy<00:04:07.040> but<00:04:08.040> other<00:04:08.250> than

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
prototypical accuracy but other than

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.659 
prototypical accuracy but other than
this<00:04:08.639> minor<00:04:09.060> difference<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.590> 284<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.489> the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
this minor difference the 284 of the

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.929 
this minor difference the 284 of the
2760<00:04:12.599> it's<00:04:13.319> still<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> good<00:04:13.949> representation<00:04:14.489> of

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
2760 it's still a good representation of

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.399 
2760 it's still a good representation of
what<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.659> real<00:04:16.199> engine<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:19.169> connection

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
what the real engine was the connection

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.289 
what the real engine was the connection

make<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> little<00:04:29.730> more<00:04:29.820> realistic<00:04:30.560> but<00:04:31.560> as<00:04:31.830> far

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
make a little more realistic but as far

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.520 
make a little more realistic but as far
as<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.340> goes<00:04:32.400> it's<00:04:32.880> okay<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.260> Center

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
as this goes it's okay and this Center

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.230 
as this goes it's okay and this Center
does<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:34.980> much<00:04:35.190> better<00:04:35.370> improvement<00:04:35.910> as

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
does have a much better improvement as

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.900 
does have a much better improvement as
far<00:04:36.570> as<00:04:36.690> Bachmann's<00:04:37.140> wiring<00:04:37.590> system<00:04:37.980> as<00:04:38.130> you

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
far as Bachmann's wiring system as you

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.240 
far as Bachmann's wiring system as you
can<00:04:39.060> see<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:40.200> above<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.800> pen<00:04:41.220> and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
can see it is a little above the pen and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.700 
can see it is a little above the pen and
whole<00:04:41.550> as<00:04:41.820> opposed<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.450> many<00:04:43.260> Bachmann

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
whole as opposed to many Bachmann

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.860 
whole as opposed to many Bachmann
locomotives<00:04:44.310> where<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:44.970> actually<00:04:45.090> very<00:04:45.300> low

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
locomotives where it's actually very low

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.450 
locomotives where it's actually very low
can<00:04:46.140> actually<00:04:46.470> touch<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.710> ties<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
can actually touch the ties of the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.240 
can actually touch the ties of the
railroad<00:04:47.700> tracks<00:04:48.260> which<00:04:49.260> is<00:04:49.440> sort<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.710> unsafe

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
railroad tracks which is sort of unsafe

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.760 
railroad tracks which is sort of unsafe
for<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> engine<00:04:50.760> but<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.300> one<00:04:51.480> here<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:51.990> good

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
for the engine but this one here is good

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.140 
for the engine but this one here is good
to<00:04:52.920> go<00:04:54.380> among<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.560> white<00:04:55.860> wall<00:04:56.100> wheels<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.760> have

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
to go among the white wall wheels I have

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.540 
to go among the white wall wheels I have
found<00:04:57.390> no<00:04:57.690> traction<00:04:58.050> tires<00:04:58.440> at<00:04:58.920> since<00:04:59.400> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
found no traction tires at since the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.820 
found no traction tires at since the
engine<00:04:59.790> is<00:04:59.880> plastic<00:05:00.480> isn't<00:05:01.200> very<00:05:01.560> heavy

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
engine is plastic isn't very heavy

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.040 
engine is plastic isn't very heavy
either<00:05:02.180> however<00:05:03.180> though<00:05:03.450> this<00:05:03.630> engine<00:05:03.930> is

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
either however though this engine is

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.960 
either however though this engine is
still<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.290> very<00:05:04.650> good<00:05:04.890> polar<00:05:05.160> as<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.850> will

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
still a very good polar as I will

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.390 
still a very good polar as I will
demonstrate<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.480> little<00:05:06.720> later<00:05:07.250> while<00:05:08.250> the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
demonstrate a little later while the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.670 
demonstrate a little later while the
locomotive<00:05:09.090> isn't<00:05:09.600> accurate<00:05:09.810> enough<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.380> be

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
locomotive isn't accurate enough to be

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.280 
locomotive isn't accurate enough to be
the<00:05:10.860> exact<00:05:11.310> model<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.390> prototype<00:05:12.990> which

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
the exact model of the prototype which

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.740 
the exact model of the prototype which
still<00:05:13.590> exists<00:05:14.010> today<00:05:14.420> it's<00:05:15.420> still<00:05:15.690> a

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
still exists today it's still a

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.770 
still exists today it's still a
realistic<00:05:16.230> locomotive<00:05:17.010> for<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.220> CNO<00:05:17.670> and<00:05:17.940> it

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
realistic locomotive for the CNO and it

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.260 
realistic locomotive for the CNO and it
is<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.140> cheaper<00:05:19.740> alternative<00:05:19.770> compared<00:05:20.640> to<00:05:20.820> the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
is a cheaper alternative compared to the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.910 
is a cheaper alternative compared to the
Broadway<00:05:21.510> limited<00:05:21.840> with<00:05:22.290> likes<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.740> Mike's

Broadway limited with likes of Mike's
train<00:05:23.250> house<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:24.570> I'd<00:05:24.810> recommend<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.590> give

train house so I'd recommend it and give

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.010 
train house so I'd recommend it and give
the<00:05:25.890> thumbs<00:05:26.130> up<00:05:26.370> if<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.450> have<00:05:27.480> any<00:05:27.840> thoughts
