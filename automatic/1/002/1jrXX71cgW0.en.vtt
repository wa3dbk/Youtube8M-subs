00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
notice that in this game Drake moves

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
notice that in this game Drake moves
almost<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:41.960> Ezio<00:01:42.960> from<00:01:43.470> Assassin's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
almost like in Ezio from Assassin's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.569 
almost like in Ezio from Assassin's
Creed<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.549> he<00:01:44.640> does<00:01:44.850> his<00:01:45.030> initial<00:01:45.450> jump

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
Creed like when he does his initial jump

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.220 
Creed like when he does his initial jump
especially<00:01:47.579> when<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.970> against<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.740 

a<00:01:52.380> wall<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.400> not<00:01:53.640> meant<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> climbing

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a wall that you're not meant to climbing

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
a wall that you're not meant to climbing
does<00:01:54.870> that<00:01:55.050> kind<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.470> jump<00:01:55.800> up<00:01:55.950> against

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
does that kind of like jump up against

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.430 
does that kind of like jump up against
it<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> leg<00:01:57.000> thing<00:01:57.720> that's<00:01:57.990> kind<00:01:58.320> of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
it with the leg thing that's kind of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.150 
it with the leg thing that's kind of
weird<00:01:58.640> I'm<00:01:59.640> probably<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.300> lot<00:02:00.330> later

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
weird I'm probably see that a lot later

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.150 
weird I'm probably see that a lot later
well<00:02:02.160> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.580> don't<00:02:03.390> remember<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.830> was<00:02:04.860> as

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
well so I don't remember if it was as

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.250 
well so I don't remember if it was as
prevalent<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.880> uncharted<00:02:06.300> two<00:02:06.720> but<00:02:07.140> it's

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
prevalent and uncharted two but it's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.160 
prevalent and uncharted two but it's
definitely<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.010> game<00:02:08.280> where<00:02:09.150> the<00:02:09.960> color

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
definitely in this game where the color

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.740 
definitely in this game where the color
yellow<00:02:10.700> will<00:02:11.700> pretty<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.270> guide<00:02:12.570> you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
yellow will pretty much guide you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.740 
yellow will pretty much guide you
towards<00:02:13.140> wherever<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.680> need<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.830> go<00:02:14.750> almost

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
towards wherever you need to go almost

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.090 
towards wherever you need to go almost
like<00:02:15.960> Mirror's<00:02:16.290> Edge<00:02:16.410> where<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.890> want<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
like Mirror's Edge where you want to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.230 
like Mirror's Edge where you want to
look<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:17.220> red<00:02:17.490> stuff<00:02:17.760> that's<00:02:18.000> where<00:02:18.150> you

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
look for red stuff that's where you

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 
look for red stuff that's where you
supposed<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.660> well<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.740> game<00:02:19.950> you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
supposed to go well in this game you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
supposed to go well in this game you
find<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> yellow<00:02:21.060> ledge<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:21.690> something

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
find like a yellow ledge or something

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.510 
find like a yellow ledge or something
that's<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.190> you're<00:02:23.310> meant

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that's that's the way that you're meant

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.140 
that's that's the way that you're meant
to<00:02:23.640> go

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.570 

now<00:02:29.720> where<00:02:29.930> did<00:02:30.049> he<00:02:30.170> go

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.820 

so<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.420> have<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.630> continue<00:02:35.080> following<00:02:35.290> cell<00:02:35.680> 8

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
so you have to continue following cell 8

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.620 
so you have to continue following cell 8
now<00:02:36.010> there's<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.280> there's<00:02:36.940> two<00:02:37.000> treasures<00:02:37.510> in

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
now there's a there's two treasures in

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.890 
now there's a there's two treasures in
this<00:02:37.780> area<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.260> got<00:02:38.470> really<00:02:39.070> turned<00:02:39.220> around

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
this area I got really turned around

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.050 
this area I got really turned around
looking<00:02:40.900> for<00:02:40.930> them<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:42.220> you're<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.670> see

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
looking for them so you're going to see

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.450 
looking for them so you're going to see
some<00:02:43.360> pretty<00:02:43.660> gnarly<00:02:44.020> video<00:02:44.620> editing<00:02:45.070> here<00:02:45.430> a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
some pretty gnarly video editing here a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.350 
some pretty gnarly video editing here a
second<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.860> go<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.240> you're

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
second there you go so when you're

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.090 
second there you go so when you're
approaching<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.870> towards<00:02:50.410> Sully<00:02:50.800> it's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
approaching this towards Sully it's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.290 
approaching this towards Sully it's
going<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.340> be<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.490> your<00:02:51.580> right<00:02:51.730> side<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.030> have<00:02:52.120> to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
going to be on your right side I have to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.550 
going to be on your right side I have to
turn<00:02:52.450> around<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.900> come<00:02:52.990> here<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.380> left

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
turn around and come here on the left

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.030 
turn around and come here on the left
side<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:53.860> pick<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.100> up<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:56.440> you'll<00:02:56.800> notice

side to pick it up but you'll notice

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.130 
side to pick it up but you'll notice
where<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.460> is<00:02:57.640> there's<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.360> set<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.870> steps

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.920 

now<00:03:57.820> in<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.480> interest<00:03:58.990> of<00:03:59.910> everybody's<00:04:00.910> time

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.290 

threw<00:04:04.930> down<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.080> little<00:04:05.290> bit<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.650> fast<00:04:05.920> forward

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
threw down a little bit of fast forward

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.930 
threw down a little bit of fast forward
on<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.720> section<00:04:08.670> remember<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.700> was<00:04:09.790> talking

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
on this section remember I was talking

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.850 
on this section remember I was talking
about<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> yellow<00:04:10.510> ledges<00:04:10.840> well<00:04:11.050> here's<00:04:11.650> your

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
about the yellow ledges well here's your

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.530 
about the yellow ledges well here's your
first<00:04:12.400> glimpse<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.940> logarithm<00:04:13.150> for

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
first glimpse of the logarithm for

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.490 
first glimpse of the logarithm for
getting<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.470> find<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.830> way<00:04:14.950> up<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.290> how

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
getting to find a way up so this is how

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.740 
getting to find a way up so this is how
you<00:04:17.530> get<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:17.980> top<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:19.150> need<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.420> go<00:04:19.540> make

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
you get to the top you need to go make

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.680 
you get to the top you need to go make
your<00:04:19.870> way<00:04:20.020> up<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.350> next<00:04:20.560> level<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:22.570> can

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
your way up to the next level so you can

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.570 
your way up to the next level so you can
look<00:04:22.810> through<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> window<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:24.460> the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
look through the window and see the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.380 
look through the window and see the
story<00:04:26.310> if<00:04:27.310> you're<00:04:27.460> flying<00:04:27.580> on<00:04:27.700> crushing<00:04:27.970> you

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
story if you're flying on crushing you

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.730 
story if you're flying on crushing you
should<00:04:28.630> probably<00:04:28.840> remember<00:04:29.380> how<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.560> do<00:04:29.710> this

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
should probably remember how to do this

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.190 
should probably remember how to do this
because<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.340> are<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> beat<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.790> game<00:04:30.940> once<00:04:31.200> if

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
because you are a beat the game once if

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.580
