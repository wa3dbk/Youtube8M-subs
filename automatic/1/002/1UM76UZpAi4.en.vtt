hey I think everything happens for a
reason<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.690> I<00:00:34.839> learnt<00:00:35.109> over<00:00:35.319> the<00:00:35.530> years<00:00:35.829> and

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
reason and I learnt over the years and

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.739 
reason and I learnt over the years and
not<00:00:36.159> to<00:00:36.339> always<00:00:36.730> ask<00:00:36.909> questions<00:00:37.480> when

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:37.749 
not to always ask questions when

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.079

something<00:00:38.199> goes<00:00:38.379> on<00:00:38.679> but<00:00:39.399> the<00:00:39.460> government

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
something goes on but the government

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.380
