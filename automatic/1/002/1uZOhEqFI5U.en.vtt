00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and you can so one slice would be like a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.660 
and you can so one slice would be like a
slice<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.360> cake

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670

with<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.680> dough<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.460> definitely<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
with the dough that's definitely a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.100 
with the dough that's definitely a
two-person<00:01:42.869> job<00:01:43.100> okay<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> first

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
pre-baked crust in the bottom of the pan

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.030 
pre-baked crust in the bottom of the pan
everything<00:01:49.110> looks<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> seal

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
everything looks like it's going to seal

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
everything looks like it's going to seal
up<00:01:50.280> nicely<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> assemble

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
up nicely and we're going to assemble

00:01:52.380 --> 00:03:04.890 
up nicely and we're going to assemble
quickly<00:01:52.950> before<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.180> snow<00:01:54.450> starts<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> relax

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.540 

we<00:03:05.900> saw<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.440> crust<00:03:06.680> was<00:03:06.950> sliding<00:03:07.250> down

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
we saw that the crust was sliding down

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.160 
we saw that the crust was sliding down
the<00:03:07.760> side<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.630> had<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.900> take<00:03:09.110> some

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the side so we had to take some

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.100 
the side so we had to take some
emergency<00:03:10.130> action<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.270> wrap<00:03:11.510> this<00:03:11.690> thing<00:03:11.750> in

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
emergency action and wrap this thing in

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.560 
emergency action and wrap this thing in
foil<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.560> we're<00:03:12.830> hoping<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.520> roll<00:03:14.330> at<00:03:14.540> the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
foil and we're hoping that roll at the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:26.110 
foil and we're hoping that roll at the
top<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.320> gonna<00:03:15.530> keep<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.040> size<00:03:16.400> person<00:03:25.120> okay

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
top is gonna keep the size person okay

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.570 
top is gonna keep the size person okay
so<00:03:26.180> you've<00:03:26.420> had<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.080> for<00:03:27.380> about<00:03:27.620> 45

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
so you've had this in for about 45

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.510 
so you've had this in for about 45
minutes<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.470> took<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> while<00:03:30.950> for<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
minutes and it took a while for the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.680 
minutes and it took a while for the
sides<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.530> bake<00:03:33.530> through<00:03:34.300> but<00:03:35.300> now<00:03:35.510> we're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
sides to bake through but now we're

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.380 
sides to bake through but now we're
gonna<00:03:35.980> unveil<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.610> see<00:03:37.760> how<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.000> came<00:03:38.150> out

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
gonna unveil it and see how it came out

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.520 
gonna unveil it and see how it came out
I<00:03:38.740> remember<00:03:39.740> this<00:03:39.920> was<00:03:40.450> based<00:03:41.450> on<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.690> Photoshop

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
I remember this was based on a Photoshop

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.980 
I remember this was based on a Photoshop
I<00:03:42.770> did<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:43.430> like<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.420> don't<00:03:44.600> hold

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990
