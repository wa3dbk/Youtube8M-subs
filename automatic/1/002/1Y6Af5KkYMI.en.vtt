00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

here<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.539> some<00:00:01.020> reasons<00:00:01.500> about<00:00:01.709> why<00:00:01.920> this

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
here is some reasons about why this

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.349 
here is some reasons about why this
happens<00:00:02.610> yes<00:00:03.449> that's<00:00:03.780> your<00:00:03.929> grin<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:05.359> there's

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
happens yes that's your grin and there's

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.089 
happens yes that's your grin and there's
a<00:00:06.420> right<00:00:07.140> side<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.730> left<00:00:08.849> side<00:00:09.740> now<00:00:10.740> as<00:00:10.950> you

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
a right side and a left side now as you

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.440 
a right side and a left side now as you
can<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:12.179> serve<00:00:12.540> different<00:00:13.410> functions

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
can see they serve different functions

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.939 
can see they serve different functions
so<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> left<00:00:15.809> side<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> brain<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.740> more

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
so the left side of the brain is more

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.480 
so the left side of the brain is more
sort<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> logical<00:00:17.970> analytical<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.490> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
sort of logical analytical and really

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.689 
sort of logical analytical and really
responds<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.199> verbal<00:00:22.740> written<00:00:22.980> commands

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
responds to the verbal written commands

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.599 
responds to the verbal written commands
kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.689> useful<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.170> our<00:00:25.410> process<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.220> acting

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
kind of useful for our process of acting

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.890 
kind of useful for our process of acting
you<00:00:26.640> know<00:00:26.789> when<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.420> understand

you know when you have to understand
text<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.560> dissect<00:00:29.010> what's<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> then

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
text and dissect what's going on then

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.580 
text and dissect what's going on then
you<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> able<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> use<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.260> side<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you have to be able to use that side of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
you have to be able to use that side of
your<00:00:31.710> brain<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.099> here's<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.880> here's<00:00:33.149> the

news it's the other side of the brain

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.479 
news it's the other side of the brain
there<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.059> much<00:00:36.630> much<00:00:37.020> more<00:00:37.440> useful<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
there is much much more useful and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.060 
there is much much more useful and
powerful<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> purposes<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> acting<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
right side of the brain which is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.430 
right side of the brain which is
emotional<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.160> creative<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.930> really

the senses have been engaged and an

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
the senses have been engaged and an
experience<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.460> you've<00:01:23.580> had<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:24.570> how

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
processed it therefore it's logical to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.100

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
think that if you want to recreate that
emotion<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.640> gonna<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
emotion then you are gonna have to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.469 
emotion then you are gonna have to
function<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.520> side<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> brain<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
function with that side of the brain and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.080 
function with that side of the brain and
you're<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> communicate<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
you're going to have to communicate it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.160 
you're going to have to communicate it
communicate<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
communicate with it and a way that it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.280 
communicate with it and a way that it
understands<00:01:41.030> now<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.210> happens<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.899> a
