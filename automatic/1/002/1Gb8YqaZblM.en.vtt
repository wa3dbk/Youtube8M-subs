for his back had all the plastics off
and<00:00:22.529> he<00:00:23.490> had<00:00:23.609> spark<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.769> miele

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and he had spark when the miele

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.500 
and he had spark when the miele
flashlight<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> voltage<00:00:27.150> regulator

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
flashlight when the voltage regulator

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
flashlight when the voltage regulator
right<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:28.010> was<00:00:29.010> unplugged<00:00:29.429> he<00:00:29.939> had<00:00:30.060> perfect

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
right there was unplugged he had perfect

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.110 
right there was unplugged he had perfect
spark<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.650> bike<00:00:31.830> fired<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:33.030> he

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
spark the bike fired right up when he

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.360 
spark the bike fired right up when he
plugged<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.540> back<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.899> no<00:00:34.500> spark<00:00:34.950> he<00:00:35.190> even

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
plugged it back in no spark he even

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.000 
plugged it back in no spark he even
showed<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> plug<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.649> that<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:37.800> goes

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
showed you at the plug and that he goes

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
showed you at the plug and that he goes
if<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.340> take<00:00:38.550> off<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.940> plastic<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.809> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
if you take off the plastic but this in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
if you take off the plastic but this in
this<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.710> did<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.180> take

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
this case I did not have to if you take

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.209 
this case I did not have to if you take
it<00:00:42.510> off<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.079> wire<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.649> coming<00:00:44.100> from

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it off this wire right here coming from

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.369 
it off this wire right here coming from
the<00:00:44.640> stator<00:00:44.879> there's<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.719> wires<00:00:45.899> coming<00:00:46.200> up

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the stator there's two wires coming up

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
the stator there's two wires coming up
from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> stator<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.850> big<00:00:48.090> plug<00:00:48.390> for

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
from the stator this is one big plug for

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
from the stator this is one big plug for
the<00:00:48.719> stator<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> red<00:00:50.250> wire<00:00:50.460> coming<00:00:50.760> out

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the stator it has a red wire coming out

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.840 
the stator it has a red wire coming out
this<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.610> they<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
this one in this one on they put a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
this one in this one on they put a
raptor<00:00:54.300> 660<00:00:54.870> engine<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.530> motorcycle<00:00:56.250> not

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
raptor 660 engine in a motorcycle not

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.889 
raptor 660 engine in a motorcycle not
these<00:00:56.730> guys<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.270> talking<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
these guys I'm talking about just in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.380 
these guys I'm talking about just in
general<00:00:58.050> Yamaha<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.430> motorcycle<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
general Yamaha in a motorcycle with a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
general Yamaha in a motorcycle with a
Kickstarter<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> way<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.980> would<00:01:02.100> not

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Kickstarter so this way it would not

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
Kickstarter so this way it would not
kick<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> Kickstarter<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
kick back on the Kickstarter they put a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
kick back on the Kickstarter they put a
safety<00:01:04.409> wire<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> way<00:01:05.339> would<00:01:05.549> not

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
safety wire and that way would not

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
safety wire and that way would not
reversely<00:01:06.630> start<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.500> Koff<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> spark

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
reversely start now Koff the spark

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.660 
reversely start now Koff the spark
perversely<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.900> wire<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.710> kept<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
perversely now that wire they kept it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.320 
perversely now that wire they kept it
going<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> raptor<00:01:12.750> 660<00:01:13.320> quad<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
going in the raptor 660 quad so which is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.730 
going in the raptor 660 quad so which is
what<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> wire<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.229> wire<00:01:16.409> right<00:01:16.560> there

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
what that wire for that wire right there

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.510 
what that wire for that wire right there
is<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.220> safety<00:01:17.869> nothing<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
is just a safety nothing at all so the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
is just a safety nothing at all so the
guy<00:01:20.640> goes<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.970> cut<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> wire<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.810> should<00:01:22.020> be

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
guy goes you cut that wire you should be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
guy goes you cut that wire you should be
fine<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.710> cut<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> wire<00:01:25.070> as<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.090> see

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
fine I just cut the wire as you can see

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.770 
fine I just cut the wire as you can see
my<00:01:27.420> voltage<00:01:27.720> regulator<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.200> plugged<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.780> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
my voltage regulator is plugged in and I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.060 
my voltage regulator is plugged in and I
cut<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> wire<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.560> fine

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
cut the wire and I'm fine

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.999 
cut the wire and I'm fine
the<00:01:33.060> bike<00:01:33.240> runs<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.230 
the bike runs so what I'm going to do is
really<00:01:35.159> quickly<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.549> gonna<00:01:35.670> try<00:01:35.790> putting

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
really quickly I'm gonna try putting

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.550 
really quickly I'm gonna try putting
some<00:01:36.299> electrical<00:01:36.780> tape<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> wire<00:01:37.380> then

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
some electrical tape on that wire then

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.109 
some electrical tape on that wire then
I'm<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> seal<00:01:37.950> everything<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.640> I'm

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I'm going to seal everything back up I'm

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
I'm going to seal everything back up I'm
in<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.299> pajamas<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:40.079> now<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:41.009> came
