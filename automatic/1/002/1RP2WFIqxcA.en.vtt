00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
Himalayan climbing is going to be like I

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.890 
Himalayan climbing is going to be like I
believe<00:03:20.700> alpinism<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.930> gonna<00:03:23.389> go<00:03:24.389> different

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
believe alpinism is gonna go different

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.289 
believe alpinism is gonna go different
ways<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.409> I<00:03:26.010> don't<00:03:26.609> think<00:03:26.819> there<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.000> one

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
ways like I don't think there is one

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.690 
ways like I don't think there is one
single<00:03:27.780> style<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.319> we<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.829> do<00:03:28.980> or<00:03:29.189> that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
single style that we have to do or that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.449 
single style that we have to do or that
is<00:03:29.909> that<00:03:30.689> has<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.200> be<00:03:31.230> considered<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.950> best<00:03:32.099> so

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
is that has to be considered the best so

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.039 
is that has to be considered the best so
but<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.819> think<00:03:33.000> there<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.269> many<00:03:33.480> styles<00:03:33.959> that

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
but I think there is many styles that

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.699 
but I think there is many styles that
are<00:03:34.109> very<00:03:34.769> good<00:03:35.159> and<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:36.049> definitely<00:03:37.049> depends

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
are very good and it definitely depends

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.089 
are very good and it definitely depends
on<00:03:37.949> and<00:03:38.910> what<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.329> want<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.599> do<00:03:39.889> you<00:03:40.889> talk

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
on and what do you want to do you talk

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.849 
on and what do you want to do you talk
about<00:03:41.129> style<00:03:41.609> why<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.060> style<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.109> important<00:03:43.709> in

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
about style why is style so important in

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.309 
about style why is style so important in
climbing<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.879> why<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.419> such<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> huge

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
climbing and why is it such a huge

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.890 
climbing and why is it such a huge
source<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.889> heated<00:03:47.730> controversy<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.659> debate

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900
