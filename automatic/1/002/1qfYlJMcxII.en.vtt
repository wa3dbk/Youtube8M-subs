nine<00:00:46.020> nations<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.980> player<00:00:47.219> schools<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
nine nations if a player schools a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.040 
nine nations if a player schools a
couple<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> goals<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.450> even<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> hat<00:00:48.870> trick

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
couple of goals or even the hat trick

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
couple of goals or even the hat trick
they're<00:00:49.590> bound<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.460> price<00:00:50.489> guys<00:00:51.000> so

obviously they have a good game cuz I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.600 
obviously they have a good game cuz I
for<00:01:07.049> example<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.470> said<00:01:07.710> Neymar<00:01:08.189> he's<00:01:08.369> now

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
for example like said Neymar he's now

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550 
for example like said Neymar he's now
fit<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> ready<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> play<00:01:09.570> he<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:10.020> injured<00:01:10.350> for

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
fit and ready to play he was injured for

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740 
fit and ready to play he was injured for
a<00:01:10.590> day<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.040> something<00:01:11.310> stupid<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.630> was

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
a day or something stupid but that was

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
a day or something stupid but that was
nothing<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.170> worry<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:14.250> name

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
nothing to worry about so I think name

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
nothing to worry about so I think name
was<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> brilliant<00:01:15.479> world<00:01:15.840> cup<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
was gonna have a brilliant world cup and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.330 
was gonna have a brilliant world cup and
I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.500> he's<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.310> price

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I think he's going to go up in price

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
I think he's going to go up in price
quite<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> lot<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.119> he<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.450> play<00:01:18.720> well<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
quite a lot of he does play well now

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.340 
quite a lot of he does play well now
obviously<00:01:19.860> Royce<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.610> injured<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.960> he<00:01:22.110> won't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
obviously Royce is injured so he won't

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
obviously Royce is injured so he won't
be<00:01:22.409> playing<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.460> river<00:01:23.790> ease

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
be playing and I think river ease

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999 
be playing and I think river ease
injured<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.320> someone<00:01:25.890> like

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
injured as well I think someone like

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
injured as well I think someone like
Diego<00:01:26.310> cost<00:01:26.729> off<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.150> Spain<00:01:27.420> could<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Diego cost off for Spain could have a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499

very<00:01:28.200> good<00:01:28.530> world<00:01:28.740> cup<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.280> obviously<00:01:29.759> normal

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
very good world cup so obviously normal

card<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.110> cheap<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.770> might<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.040> worth

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
card is so cheap so it might be worth

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
card is so cheap so it might be worth
investing<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> its<00:01:33.150> informs<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:33.900> even

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
investing in one of its informs or even

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
investing in one of its informs or even
his<00:01:34.740> team<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> season<00:01:35.460> card<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.090> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
his team in a season card that's what I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.960 
his team in a season card that's what I
think<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> best<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
think will be the best thing to do for a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
think will be the best thing to do for a
play<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.329> cost<00:01:39.540> okay<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.140> they've<00:01:40.290> got<00:01:40.409> an

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
play that cost okay if they've got an

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.929 
play that cost okay if they've got an
informal<00:01:40.979> team<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.310> seasoned<00:01:41.610> definitely

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
informal team and seasoned definitely

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.109 
informal team and seasoned definitely
invest<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.479> instead<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> I'll<00:01:45.090> just

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
invest in that instead so I'll just

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.670 
invest in that instead so I'll just
quickly<00:01:45.509> show<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.899> how<00:01:46.140> much<00:01:46.290> team<00:01:46.560> the

quickly show you how much team the
season<00:01:46.950> cost<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.490> sort<00:01:47.670> predictors

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
season cost was not sort predictors

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
season cost was not sort predictors
price<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.680> need

around<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> goal<00:01:52.829> scorers<00:01:53.509> predict<00:01:54.509> what's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
around the goal scorers predict what's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.420 
around the goal scorers predict what's
going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> happen<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> might<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> bit<00:01:56.219> risky

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
going to happen you might be a bit risky

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.429 
going to happen you might be a bit risky
but<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> might<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.899> could<00:01:58.110> pay<00:01:58.290> off

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
but it might not and it could pay off

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.830 
but it might not and it could pay off
guys<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.189> costing<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.640> about<00:01:59.840> 240

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
guys so you can see costing is about 240

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.609

about 300 k guys so it could be worth
