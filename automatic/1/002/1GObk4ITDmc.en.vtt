aesthetics<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> case<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.159> slightly<00:01:05.610> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
aesthetics of the case very slightly but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.260 
aesthetics of the case very slightly but
I<00:01:06.840> hate<00:01:07.560> having<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:08.280> flip<00:01:08.610> style<00:01:08.820> cases

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I hate having these flip style cases

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
I hate having these flip style cases
where<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.659> flap<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.229> opens<00:01:10.830> all<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> time

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
where this flap just opens all the time

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.210 
where this flap just opens all the time
so<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.659> essential<00:01:13.110> either<00:01:13.830> that

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so this is really essential either that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.480 
so this is really essential either that
or<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.400> big<00:01:14.640> magnetic<00:01:15.119> closure<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.159> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
this now so we clip it in that side and

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.559 
this now so we clip it in that side and
then<00:03:13.080> clip<00:03:13.379> in<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.709> side<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:14.909> is<00:03:15.090> inside

add a little bit of bulk on let me just

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.070 
add a little bit of bulk on let me just
turn<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.360> if<00:03:54.420> we<00:03:54.510> were<00:03:54.689> making<00:03:54.989> or

turn this on so if we were making or

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.130 
turn this on so if we were making or
taking<00:03:55.439> calls<00:03:55.709> we<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.519> got<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:56.909> sort<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.269> to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
taking calls we have got this sort of to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.500 
taking calls we have got this sort of to
deal<00:03:58.349> with<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.890> will<00:03:59.159> flatten<00:03:59.489> with<00:03:59.730> time<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
deal with it will flatten with time it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.449 
deal with it will flatten with time it
will<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.870> down<00:04:01.080> into<00:04:01.349> sort<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.920> or<00:04:02.159> shape

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
will go down into sort of this or shape

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.979 
will go down into sort of this or shape
once<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.030> case<00:04:03.209> becomes<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.720> bit<00:04:03.840> more

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
once the case becomes a bit more

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.710 
once the case becomes a bit more
flexible<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.650> then<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.400> course<00:04:05.430> when<00:04:06.420> we<00:04:06.599> are

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
flexible and then of course when we are

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.410 
flexible and then of course when we are
closing<00:04:07.140> up<00:04:07.409> like<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:08.069> we've<00:04:08.760> got<00:04:08.939> this<00:04:09.090> nice
