 Hi, this is Real. 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.440
 This lecture is a lecture of proxy used for wing and pump. 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.260
 So let's get started! 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.980
 Let's add a model that will become a wing. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.820
 Then add a proxy ... 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.900
 Set the variable name to 'Angle' 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.880
 Sin (time () * speed) ^ Delay * range in the formula. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 For reference, as described in section 7 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.100
 X, Y and Z axes can be operated separately. 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 Complete formula entry! 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.480
 I'm fluttering like this. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.440
 I use this to make wings as I said in the title. 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.560
 If you set the variable name to a position instead of an angle, you can create a machine like a pump. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.200
 I'll show you an example from now on. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.660
 Wings of the King Cockroach 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.300
 Poor dance dance PAC using angle + position properly 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 This tutorial is here. Let's see it in chapter 23!
