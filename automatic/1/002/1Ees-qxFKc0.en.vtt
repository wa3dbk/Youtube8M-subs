00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hello dear friends today wanted 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.440
 to continue a series of stories about 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.710
 planning power loads and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.430
 talk about planning 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:24.480
 strength training with a lack of time 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:29.240
 on training in general this question 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.240
 very often beginners ask not only 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:37.129
 is the following if i don't 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.110
 I have enough time to train and 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.940
 7 hard work physical feed 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.940
 train and so on well in general 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 miracles happen rarely have you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 hard physical work and even sometimes 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 and psychologically nothing 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.800
 good can not count on 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 some progress 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.840
 hardly anything is possible 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 maintain some particular form 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:13.850
 there in a tone so let's say something more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:15.920
 you can not count here, but sometimes you can 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.720
 if there is very little time yet 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.750
 have plan your workouts due 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.530
 way leaving is only necessary 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.530
 exercise and 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:35.240
 and even in general I progress personally 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.610
 I succeed therefore for your attention 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.430
 I want to present my program 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.789
 training conditions lack of time 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.539
 immediately say that this is not a panacea for some 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.409
 I donâ€™t recommend it to you there 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.009
 it will help you 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.050
 she picked up under me again under 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.319
 my training opportunities 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.330
 recovering my age and some 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.720
 little experience on her on the bed but can 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:07.640
 it will be useful to you in general 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.970
 as already said is very difficult 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 the big working day started working 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.190
 opportunity to ride the desert is not 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.810
 it seems almost no 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.320
 there is only in the middle of the day 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.690
 a small break of about an hour for lunch 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.000
 here at this hour can be a half 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.660
 maximum and in these one and a half hours I 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 I manage 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:40.740
 practice and eat food that is 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:46.140
 otherwise it does not work so then 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.550
 by program for yourself and you can 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.890
 see what came of it 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.490
 then in general it turns out 2 2 days 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.520
 workout the first second day well 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.930
 I train mostly tuesday friday 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.020
 either there monday-thursday 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.010
 necessarily twice a week at first 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.620
 day i'm doing 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:14.670
 basic strength exercises squat jim 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:18.020
 biceps can be removed if hyper 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.820
 and press sometimes stretching naturally 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:26.070
 warm-up stretching present by 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:35.520
 default and the second day as you can 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:39.300
 see the same squat bench standing 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.910
 thrust to the chin plus lifting 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.350
 dumbbells hyper and pliz again c to 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.380
 chin can also be removed here press 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.390
 standing up 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.910
 leaving it you can replace the press narrow 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.120
 Grip here and even in principle here 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.830
 visible certain 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.020
 kilogram it made this table but to 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.320
 they should not be tied in general 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.640
 don't even have to look at it especially 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.099
 it turns out as follows 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:19.620
 let's say we squat 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:21.840
 the first week let's say 150 kilograms in 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.639
 first day these are load schedules 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.419
 You can see the graphics three knives but the same 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.580
 the most common sinusoid that is Russian 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.780
 first grows then falls then again 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.870
 common spirava is not loading 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.360
 But the difference from the previous ones 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.870
 some programs which showed it in 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.770
 Generally on a more intuitive level 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:53.720
 goes to the gravel bones themselves for well-being 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.220
 and so on, that is, let's say well 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.669
 rejection zheka weights here Chris 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.850
 which is written let's say the first week 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.580
 you are chairing 50 grams first day 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.950
 4 sets of five repetition of a 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.840
 let's say further on the second day 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.180
 building 55 relocate at three 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.970
 four and so on from week to week 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.160
 adding vesa sometimes 3 to 5 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.190
 kilogram is gradually progressing 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.860
 similar in the press here is unity as you 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.660
 can see it too can see where 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.200
 same traction 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.810
 deadlift generally can be done for 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.470
 me again button twice a month and 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.870
 in general, you constantly squat 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.060
 weights in squats grow then basically 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.870
 nothing catastrophic 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.940
 will do once a month in general 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.080
 then with a constant increase in the scales 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.090
 visit yours will grow too 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.520
 so I do it either on the second day 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.910
 I insert it here, that is, the first one goes 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.910
 traction 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:04.229
 either go opportunity this money have 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.889
 only traction and that's all 1 month is quite 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.870
 enough 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.180
 what else can you add for this 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:15.159
 the program means but the time for training 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:17.050
 it turns out about 40 minutes an hour 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:22.659
 quite enough in a small setting 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:25.770
 time what else to add such a dream well 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.879
 workout skip of course here 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.710
 catastrophic because if you're on 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.650
 one week missed one workout 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.029
 with only week 5 one produced you 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.889
 missed what you got 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:38.849
 one workout this week is 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.930
 In general, there is little progress and not exactly 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.340
 ddos attacks if you are strict here 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.310
 keep diet 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.409
 all the same rest and here is this plan then in 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:51.840
 Generally progress a little bit 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:56.979
 you can carry me 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:01.620
 well write your comments questions in 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.620
 Generally what I wanted I told 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:08.610
 good luck in the gym 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.610
 become stronger place bye
