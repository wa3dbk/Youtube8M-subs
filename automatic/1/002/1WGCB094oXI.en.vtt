00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.589
 hello friends I'm donovan is to beat like 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.589
 be unique 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.889
 since the most basic trick of bmx is 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.390
 very important that you know how to do 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.550
 correctly good what you have to 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.430
 to do first is to accommodate the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.160
 bike and control the bike well 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.259
 throw it and then lift the back one already 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.370
 knowing that you can combine it to 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.570
 have a monitor 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.260
 Well the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.900
 get used to the movement of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.610
 the bike by pulling the handlebar towards you 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.610
 chest throwing like this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.430
 Well the second step is to be weeping 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.870
 from behind this step is quite difficult 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.910
 for some at the beginning because no 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.650
 are accustomed familiar with 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.670
 the movement of the bike the only thing 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.530
 you have to do is select your 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.150
 knees and when you go to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.150
 throw the bike the selections 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.320
 before the unnecessary step you already have 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.780
 mastered well us the exercises in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.450
 this step you have to pull your handlebars 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.060
 towards here and stretching the back and 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.370
 when you're going to start focusing the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.840
 arms strong forward and then 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.400
 flex the legs at the same moment 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.310
 to make good report is important 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.050
 that really they are going to do it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.900
 reflections towards the height of the handlebar 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.550
 then pick up the arms and thrusts at 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.010
 moment when you will react to them 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.760
 legs and it's important that you see 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.760
 always with the backs 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.409
 here 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.630
 well the fourth step would be what it is 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.880
 the fall remember that it is very important 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.799
 First, always have the tire of 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.500
 back so that from being blows of 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.240
 the dolls do not fall down girl 2 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.070
 as for the question of the pedals 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 the pedals to get the nice one is 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.320
 be even if it is as it is 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.720
 so or so and be even 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.790
 flex your body and increase that you go 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.130
 to talk about handlebar stretching so that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.080
 you do this with one of the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.750
 most common mistakes that happens to the headquarters 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.730
 of money hop is that many people from 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 boys carry the uneven pedals 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.990
 up or work and that's wrong 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.550
 they must go evenly always 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.240
 I seem to be the second as is the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.240
 right or left 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.920
 when it starts on the sidewalk it 's 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.330
 important that you remember the distance in 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.280
 what do you have to take from the sidewalk? 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.810
 front student 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.550
 this so that for it to pass the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.380
 two tires if you go very close is 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.360
 controllable that you shelve and go 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.400
 people when it starts to jump 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.290
 sidewalks it is important that they measure well 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.560
 the distance there is from student of the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.730
 sidewalk with respect to the sidewalk this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.140
 it has to be the same distance 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.140
 extra high in the distance 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.980
 already with practice it will not be so 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.720
 necessary that I calculated how much is the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.240
 I'm already a little bit away 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.650
 see is how much is it to separate a 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.990
 recommendation that I can give you is that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.840
 start jumping things and you can 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.310
 move or they can fall because if you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.710
 do sofÃ­a with sofas with the most 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.690
 fixed can put it on that rim 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.020
 of tracer that punch do not go to 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.020
 turn on 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.100
 to make a remote monito is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.500
 important that when you do the bike 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.340
 you have your body totally you stay 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.340
 there as long as possible 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.280
 also another way to do the only one is 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:55.499
 of the old school is raising the two 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.499
 rims pairs because the obstacles 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:05.500
 of the old school is simply 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.500
 crouch on the rise 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.579
 good when it starts to be beautiful is 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.130
 important that you do not go too fast 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.780
 because they are not used to it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.600
 to the movement that is going to be of the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.360
 then how can it be 40 back and that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.820
 you go to the bike people back if 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.870
 you go very fast to complicate and the 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.479
 true that you start using a boat or 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.500
 branches to start jumping and 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.660
 practice it 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.669
 after about three months four months 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.010
 you'll see that your bonilla has grown a lot 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.410
 you can jump bigger things 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.300
 Well after a certain time I do not know three 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.039
 months to four months you'll see that he had a 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.229
 son who is already a little taller can already 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.729
 jump with the healthiest this depends on 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.500
 how long do you practice it and the 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.080
 effort that you put it good then 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.990
 to jump already devonian stuff going on 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.120
 garden benches something like that 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.039
 they require a lot of time it serves very easy 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.750
 in videos where pro do not 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.970
 easily but it really takes time and 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.870
 do not despair hard to make you want if 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.430
 you are forced 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.590
 It is important to remember that at 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.570
 when you are going to fall golijov you have 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.400
 that is left behind so that no 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.139
 you bite because you feel pikes 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.639
 you can hit on the knees or 20 of 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.639
 Tidbits talk to you a lot 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.240
 Y 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.440
 yes 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.440
 that's all this is all friends
