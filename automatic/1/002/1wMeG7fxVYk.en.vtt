00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.869 

I<00:00:00.599> think<00:00:01.439> it's<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.650> recognition<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.490> unique

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
I think it's a recognition of the unique

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.150 
I think it's a recognition of the unique
power<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.750> patient<00:00:04.380> involvement<00:00:05.009> as<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
power the patient involvement as a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.490 
power the patient involvement as a
construct<00:00:05.759> can<00:00:06.450> have<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.899> both<00:00:07.020> provider

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
construct can have on both provider

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.190 
construct can have on both provider
satisfaction<00:00:08.460> patient<00:00:09.090> satisfaction<00:00:09.420> and

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
satisfaction patient satisfaction and

satisfaction patient satisfaction and
more<00:00:10.620> globally<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.190> improving<00:00:11.580> clinical

more globally and improving clinical

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.360 
more globally and improving clinical
outcomes<00:00:12.240> there's<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.290> unique<00:00:13.799> power<00:00:14.130> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
outcomes there's a unique power to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.919 
outcomes there's a unique power to
bringing<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.790> patients<00:00:15.000> perspective<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.839> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
at all levels the two most important

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.260 
at all levels the two most important

examples that I can share with you are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
examples that I can share with you are
one<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.500> decreased<00:01:14.070> medical<00:01:14.549> errors

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
one it really decreased medical errors

and<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> way<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.509> did<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.869> by<00:01:15.990> like

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and the way it did that is by like

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
and the way it did that is by like
letting<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> family<00:01:16.860> members<00:01:17.189> correct<00:01:17.670> us

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.510 
patients but I think the more important
reason<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.630> be<00:02:28.750> involved<00:02:29.020> is<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:30.220> reason<00:02:30.430> I'm
