base<00:02:07.760> as<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.149> saw<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.869> previous<00:02:09.080> replace<00:02:09.830> our

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
base as you saw in previous replace our

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.200 
base as you saw in previous replace our
defenses<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.300> are<00:02:11.630> extremely<00:02:12.290> spaced<00:02:12.620> out

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
defenses that are extremely spaced out

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.570 
defenses that are extremely spaced out
now<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.270> reason<00:02:14.600> being<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.320> since<00:02:16.160> most

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
now the reason being is that since most

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.270 
now the reason being is that since most
people<00:02:17.000> deploy<00:02:17.450> their<00:02:17.780> hog<00:02:17.990> riders<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:19.130> or

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
people deploy their hog riders in one or

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.060 
people deploy their hog riders in one or
two<00:02:19.310> waves<00:02:19.730> maximum<00:02:20.720> they<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.530> only<00:02:21.650> attack

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
two waves maximum they can only attack

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.850 
two waves maximum they can only attack
one<00:02:22.460> defense<00:02:22.940> at<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.210> time<00:02:23.540> before<00:02:24.080> they<00:02:24.440> hop<00:02:24.650> on

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
one defense at a time before they hop on

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.640 
one defense at a time before they hop on
to<00:02:25.070> another<00:02:25.250> defense<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.090> attack<00:02:26.350> now<00:02:27.350> because

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
to another defense to attack now because

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
to another defense to attack now because
of<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:29.060> space<00:02:29.330> out<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.540> defenses

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
of this if you space out your defenses

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.470 
of this if you space out your defenses
it<00:02:30.860> will<00:02:31.070> take<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.520> group<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.910> hog<00:02:32.120> riders

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
it will take that group of hog riders

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.830 
it will take that group of hog riders
even<00:02:32.930> longer<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.740> take<00:02:34.130> out<00:02:34.280> your<00:02:34.400> defenses<00:02:35.030> so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
even longer to take out your defenses so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.230 
even longer to take out your defenses so
that<00:02:35.990> extra<00:02:36.440> bit<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.620> time<00:02:36.950> will<00:02:37.730> allow<00:02:38.060> your

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
that extra bit of time will allow your

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.300 
that extra bit of time will allow your
defenses<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.080> weaken<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.650> group<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.130> hog

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
defenses to weaken that group of hog

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.430 
defenses to weaken that group of hog
riders<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.850> even<00:02:41.120> take<00:02:41.300> them<00:02:41.480> out<00:02:41.630> even<00:02:42.410> more

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
riders and even take them out even more

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.870 
riders and even take them out even more
than<00:02:42.800> if<00:02:42.920> your<00:02:43.070> defenses<00:02:43.550> were<00:02:43.700> just

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
than if your defenses were just

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.910 
than if your defenses were just
clustered<00:02:44.330> together<00:02:44.450> now<00:02:45.170> let's<00:02:45.350> analyze<00:02:45.770> the

space in greater detail I always look

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.530 
space in greater detail I always look
for<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.410> mortar<00:02:48.770> triangle<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:50.390> offers

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
for the mortar triangle so it offers

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.140

ground to get more range but I actually
don't<00:03:09.830> mind<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.340> setup<00:03:11.060> because<00:03:11.390> there<00:03:12.050> are

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
don't mind this setup because there are

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.229 
don't mind this setup because there are
a<00:03:12.230> lot<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.680> people<00:03:12.800> who<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.580> raid<00:03:14.030> with

a lot of people who like to raid with

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.440 
a lot of people who like to raid with
balloons<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.170> minions<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.550> cross<00:03:16.970> will<00:03:17.239> set

balloons and minions so cross will set
the<00:03:17.540> air<00:03:17.690> will<00:03:17.840> help<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.110> counter<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:19.150> town

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
the air will help to counter that town

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.580 
the air will help to counter that town
halls<00:03:20.360> on<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.630> outside<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.260> order<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.470> get

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
halls on the outside in order to get

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.100 
halls on the outside in order to get
that<00:03:21.709> free<00:03:21.950> shield<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:23.239> clan<00:03:23.840> castle

that free shield the clan castle

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.830 
that free shield the clan castle
centralized<00:03:24.830> which<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.250> key<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.580> any<00:03:25.820> base<00:03:26.060> so

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
centralized which is key to any base so

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.680 
centralized which is key to any base so
it<00:03:27.019> offers<00:03:27.500> equal<00:03:27.769> coverage<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:29.239> storages

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
it offers equal coverage the storages

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.539 
it offers equal coverage the storages
are<00:03:29.840> staggered<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:30.350> four<00:03:30.590> compartments<00:03:30.920> which

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
are staggered in four compartments which

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.430 
are staggered in four compartments which
is<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.730> good<00:03:31.910> tactic<00:03:32.330> as<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.750> mentioned<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:33.350> a

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
is a good tactic as I mentioned in a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.370 
is a good tactic as I mentioned in a
prior<00:03:33.680> video<00:03:34.070> most<00:03:34.970> times<00:03:35.269> attackers<00:03:35.989> won't

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
prior video most times attackers won't

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.070 
prior video most times attackers won't
be<00:03:36.560> able<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:37.010> destroy<00:03:37.400> all<00:03:37.640> compartments<00:03:38.080> so

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
be able to destroy all compartments so

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.140 
be able to destroy all compartments so
they'll<00:03:39.260> either<00:03:39.470> get<00:03:40.130> two<00:03:40.519> compartments

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
they'll either get two compartments

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.449 
they'll either get two compartments
maximum<00:03:41.720> or<00:03:41.989> skip<00:03:42.799> your<00:03:42.920> base<00:03:43.070> all<00:03:43.280> together

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
maximum or skip your base all together

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.210 
maximum or skip your base all together
because<00:03:43.910> it's<00:03:44.060> too<00:03:44.239> much<00:03:44.420> trouble<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:46.010> only

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
because it's too much trouble the only

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.280 
because it's too much trouble the only
thing<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.459> might<00:03:46.700> change<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.299> swapping<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.049> two

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
thing I might change is swapping the two

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.160 
thing I might change is swapping the two
wizard<00:03:48.709> towers<00:03:49.070> next<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.090> crossbows<00:03:50.600> with

wizard towers next to the crossbows with
the<00:03:51.440> crossbows<00:03:52.150> bringing<00:03:53.150> them<00:03:53.239> more<00:03:53.450> inside

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the crossbows bringing them more inside

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.560 
the crossbows bringing them more inside
and<00:03:54.049> swap<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.400> woods<00:03:55.610> or<00:03:55.760> towers<00:03:56.090> next<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.480> the
