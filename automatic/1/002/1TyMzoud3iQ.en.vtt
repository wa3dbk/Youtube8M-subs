00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
and then towards the center defensive

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.879 
and then towards the center defensive
mid<00:06:14.030> now<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.240> Russian<00:06:14.659> league<00:06:14.810> has<00:06:15.080> poor<00:06:15.650> ones

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
mid now the Russian league has poor ones

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.430 
mid now the Russian league has poor ones
but<00:06:16.070> there<00:06:16.250> nowish<00:06:16.639> meshkov<00:06:17.479> I<00:06:17.810> think<00:06:18.289> that's

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
but there nowish meshkov I think that's

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.200 
but there nowish meshkov I think that's
how<00:06:18.530> you<00:06:18.560> say<00:06:18.770> who<00:06:18.949> was<00:06:19.039> just<00:06:19.370> recently<00:06:19.699> put<00:06:20.120> in

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
how you say who was just recently put in

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.790 
how you say who was just recently put in
for<00:06:20.449> him<00:06:20.539> he's<00:06:20.690> a<00:06:20.720> centre<00:06:21.169> midfield<00:06:21.530> player

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
for him he's a centre midfield player

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.980 
for him he's a centre midfield player
but<00:06:22.460> I<00:06:22.490> would<00:06:22.759> definitely<00:06:22.970> get<00:06:23.389> him<00:06:23.570> for<00:06:23.840> the

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
but I would definitely get him for the

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.810 
but I would definitely get him for the
center<00:06:24.560> defensive<00:06:24.979> midfield<00:06:25.340> and<00:06:25.490> have<00:06:25.669> him

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
center defensive midfield and have him
