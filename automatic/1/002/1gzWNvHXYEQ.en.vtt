00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.200 
then you know you can choose by using
your<00:03:48.980> Wii<00:03:49.100> Remote<00:03:49.400> or<00:03:49.430> actually<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:49.970> screen

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
your Wii Remote or actually the screen

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.600 
your Wii Remote or actually the screen
but<00:03:50.990> as<00:03:51.080> you<00:03:51.470> can<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:51.770> using<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.130> Wii<00:03:52.310> Remote

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
but as you can see using the Wii Remote

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.330 
but as you can see using the Wii Remote
it's<00:03:53.270> actually<00:03:53.600> easier<00:03:54.050> to<00:03:54.260> play<00:03:54.890> through<00:03:55.160> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
it's actually easier to play through and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.450 
it's actually easier to play through and
it's<00:03:56.290> at<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.530> graphics<00:03:57.980> might<00:03:58.130> be<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.280> little

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
it's at the graphics might be a little

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.830 
it's at the graphics might be a little
better<00:03:58.550> since<00:03:58.880> you're<00:03:59.300> not<00:03:59.450> using<00:03:59.660> your

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
better since you're not using your

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.090 
better since you're not using your
fingers<00:04:00.140> it's<00:04:00.260> not<00:04:00.410> blocking<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:00.950> screen

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
fingers it's not blocking the screen

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.920 
fingers it's not blocking the screen
you're<00:04:01.850> using<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.240> Wii<00:04:02.360> Remote<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.780> can

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
you're using the Wii Remote you can

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.500 
you're using the Wii Remote you can
place<00:04:03.140> your<00:04:03.170> phone<00:04:03.560> on<00:04:03.890> your<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.490> wall<00:04:04.790> or<00:04:05.090> near

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
place your phone on your a wall or near

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.690 
place your phone on your a wall or near
something<00:04:06.080> like<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.470> holder<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.100> then<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.520> can

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
something like a holder and then you can

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.130 
something like a holder and then you can
just<00:04:07.850> play<00:04:08.090> from<00:04:08.300> there<00:04:08.480> as<00:04:08.570> if<00:04:08.990> you're

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
just play from there as if you're

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.930 
just play from there as if you're
actually<00:04:09.440> playing<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.740> video<00:04:09.950> game<00:04:10.160> which<00:04:10.790> is

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
actually playing a video game which is

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.190 
actually playing a video game which is
pretty<00:04:11.120> cool<00:04:11.330> so<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.690> was<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> point<00:04:12.080> of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
pretty cool so that was the point of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.960 
pretty cool so that was the point of
this<00:04:12.260> video<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:13.430> doesn't<00:04:13.670> have<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.790> be

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
this video and it doesn't have to be

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.630 
this video and it doesn't have to be
only<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.600> emulator<00:04:15.110> SNES<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.190> calls<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.549> be

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
only this emulator SNES it calls to be

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.270 
only this emulator SNES it calls to be
any<00:04:16.820> other<00:04:17.030> emulator<00:04:17.690> like<00:04:17.989> um<00:04:18.260> an<00:04:18.440> es<00:04:18.980> or

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
any other emulator like um an es or
