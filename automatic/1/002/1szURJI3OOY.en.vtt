pretty<00:00:52.110> firmly<00:00:52.469> onto<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> nail<00:00:54.350> i<00:00:55.350> actually

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
pretty firmly onto the nail i actually

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.849 
pretty firmly onto the nail i actually
dipped<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.940> finger<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> alcohol<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> then

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
dipped my finger in the alcohol and then

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650 
dipped my finger in the alcohol and then
put<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.120> peel<00:01:00.390> off

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
put it over there so it would peel off

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.889 
put it over there so it would peel off
easily<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.520> sticks<00:01:03.510> on

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
easily because if not it just sticks on

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.590 
easily because if not it just sticks on
to<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> nail<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.420> get

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to the nail and that's what you get

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
to the nail and that's what you get
looks<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.560> cool<00:01:10.770> um<00:01:11.030> we<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:12.770> tried<00:01:13.770> doing
