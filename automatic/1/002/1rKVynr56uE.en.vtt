00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
of our cameras have either CMOS or CCD

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
imaging centers Rob what have you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.940 
imaging centers Rob what have you
experienced<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> difference<00:01:54.149> between<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
experienced as a difference between a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.580 
experienced as a difference between a
CCD<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.610> CMOS<00:01:57.119> image<00:01:57.689> sensor<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:58.409> your

CCD and a CMOS image sensor in your
security<00:01:59.009> camera

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
security camera

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.670 
security camera
well<00:02:00.119> picture<00:02:00.450> tells<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.810> thousand<00:02:01.229> words<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
well picture tells a thousand words and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.679 
well picture tells a thousand words and
this<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.009> especially<00:02:02.310> true<00:02:02.549> when<00:02:03.030> looking<00:02:03.450> at

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
this is especially true when looking at

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.910 
this is especially true when looking at
the<00:02:04.130> cameras<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.280> use<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.610> our<00:02:05.640> wired<00:02:05.969> systems

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the cameras we use for our wired systems

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.410 
the cameras we use for our wired systems
over<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> CMOS<00:02:08.970> image<00:02:09.390> sensor

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
over here we have a CMOS image sensor

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.910 
over here we have a CMOS image sensor

camera

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.000 
camera
and<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:13.500> looks<00:02:13.710> like<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and as you can see it looks like the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.980 
and as you can see it looks like the
pictures<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.490> faded<00:02:14.940> kind<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.900> like

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
pictures a little faded kind of like

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.600 
pictures a little faded kind of like
washing<00:02:16.440> your<00:02:16.470> clothes<00:02:16.830> over<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.310> over<00:02:17.520> again

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
washing your clothes over and over again

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.330 
washing your clothes over and over again
I<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> black<00:02:18.630> shirt<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.530> showing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
I got a black shirt on but it's showing

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.400 
I got a black shirt on but it's showing
up<00:02:20.460> as<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:20.940> washed<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.930> got<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> lot

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
up as if it's washed out you got a lot

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.400 
up as if it's washed out you got a lot
of<00:02:22.440> light<00:02:22.740> reflecting<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.810> not
