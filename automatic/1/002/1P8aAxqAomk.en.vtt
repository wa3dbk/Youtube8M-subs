00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.390
 listened to other colleagues and have taken 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.150
 this video one more day for my channel and 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.120
 good this time playing hello 4 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.580
 for all of you guys and 4 is 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.180
 awesome the multiplayer everything there 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.650
 I no longer have time to play campaign 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.500
 I quickly got into multiplayer 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.080
 to see what is going on over there 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.150
 but yes it's awesome here I was 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.939
 playing with sensitivity number 3 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.880
 but five games later carla 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.040
 change to the roque number to six more or 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.230
 less and win six here they are watching 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.930
 killed with this submachine gun 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.390
 I highly recommend that you hold her 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.149
 it's from here I think they're playing 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.890

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.579

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.780
 watching and yes guys it's awesome what 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.520

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.250

 I need to swing weapon I believe in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.200
 the personal thing I think the weapons are very 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.810
 well balanced but I do not know about you as 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.210
 See you still have not tried the sniper 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.070

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.710
