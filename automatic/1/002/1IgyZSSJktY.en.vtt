know his power didn't really bother me
at<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.980> long<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.220> my<00:02:29.370> hand<00:02:29.580> was<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.060> knew

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
at all as long as my hand was up I knew

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.640 
at all as long as my hand was up I knew
where<00:02:30.450> his<00:02:30.540> punch<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.019> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> go<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
where his punch it was going to go and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.039 
where his punch it was going to go and
that's<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> did<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.940> blocked<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.690> see

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that's what I did I just blocked it see

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.840 
that's what I did I just blocked it see
what<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.320> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.950> once<00:02:35.340> once<00:02:35.730> I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
what was going to be and once once I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.240 
what was going to be and once once I
figure<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.799> how<00:02:37.920> he<00:02:37.950> does

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
figure out that that this is how he does

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.699 
figure out that that this is how he does
is<00:02:38.489> when<00:02:38.940> every<00:02:39.180> time<00:02:39.330> he<00:02:39.420> punches<00:02:39.750> his<00:02:40.230> body

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
is when every time he punches his body

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.770 
is when every time he punches his body
was<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.370> position<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.120> in

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
was going to be in this position and in

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.110 
was going to be in this position and in
his<00:02:42.959> reaction<00:02:43.380> after<00:02:43.500> each<00:02:43.890> punch<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.519> when<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
his reaction after each punch and when I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.660 
his reaction after each punch and when I
knew<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.930> reaction<00:02:46.380> was<00:02:47.070> very<00:02:47.310> slow<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
knew that the reaction was very slow to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.759 
knew that the reaction was very slow to
my<00:02:47.970> punches<00:02:48.390> every<00:02:48.840> time<00:02:48.959> he<00:02:49.019> hit<00:02:49.230> me<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.380> just

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
my punches every time he hit me I just

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.590 
my punches every time he hit me I just
boom<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.090> know<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.269> was<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> be

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
boom because I know it was going to be

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.840 
boom because I know it was going to be

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
this one was even better because I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.220 
this one was even better because I
thought<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.430> was<00:03:47.520> harder<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.570> was<00:03:48.870> harder

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230
