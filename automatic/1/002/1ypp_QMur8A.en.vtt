00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
did it in mine and then after it's glued

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.300 
did it in mine and then after it's glued
you<00:04:58.220> close<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:58.910> like<00:04:59.150> this<00:05:02.949> and<00:05:03.949> then<00:05:04.100> what<00:05:04.280> I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
you close it like this and then what I

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.230 
you close it like this and then what I
did<00:05:04.430> was<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.850> turned<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.270> over<00:05:06.550> put<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.729> center

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.500 
did was I turned it over put the center
this<00:05:08.960> way<00:05:09.260> in<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.740> for<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.070> center<00:05:10.520> this<00:05:11.300> is

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
this way in it for the center this is

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.510 
this way in it for the center this is
the<00:05:11.660> pocket<00:05:11.870> again<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.889> if<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.160> don't<00:05:13.340> want

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
to use it as a pocket you don't have to

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.850 
to use it as a pocket you don't have to
you<00:05:15.410> can<00:05:15.440> just<00:05:15.650> glue<00:05:16.010> it<00:05:16.160> down<00:05:17.440> but<00:05:18.440> then<00:05:18.710> again

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
you can just glue it down but then again

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.290 
you can just glue it down but then again
you<00:05:19.160> just<00:05:19.370> glue<00:05:19.699> it<00:05:19.729> on<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.720> two<00:05:20.900> sides<00:05:21.199> here

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
you just glue it on the two sides here

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.650 
you just glue it on the two sides here
then<00:05:23.300> I've<00:05:23.600> just<00:05:23.630> folded<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.440> center<00:05:24.979> up<00:05:25.220> and

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
then I've just folded the center up and

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.490 
then I've just folded the center up and
then<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.960> top<00:05:27.200> down<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:29.840> created<00:05:30.320> my

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
then the top down and that created my

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.480 
then the top down and that created my
flaps<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.900> this<00:05:33.229> opens<00:05:33.710> like<00:05:33.919> this<00:05:35.139> like<00:05:36.139> this

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
flaps so this opens like this like this

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:44.460 
flaps so this opens like this like this
and<00:05:37.490> here's<00:05:37.700> my<00:05:37.910> pocket<00:05:38.360> here<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:40.690> it<00:05:41.690> opens
