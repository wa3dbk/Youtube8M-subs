00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.149
 how many tips but before 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.980
 let's start it's very important to follow three 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.290
 beneficial steps for a hair with 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.420
 a healthy appearance that we love 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.360
 true that it will look healthy and 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.780
 perfection let's start with step 1 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.550
 it is this morning wash hair ana 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.200
 I wash your hair to camila tell us 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.660
 Well the truth is that that morning I had the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.070
 My husband's help combed her and she was 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.059
 fascinated that I had to choose between 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.880
 for hair 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.680
 rizzo and thick and thin and thin hair 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.049
 and I did not have to choose 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.350
 but I think we chose well chose the 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.210
 of hair finished exactly perfect 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.000
 now we walk to step number 2 which is 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.189
 very important to nourish the hair for 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.110
 control wavy hair like that of 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.630
 camila let's apply a conditioner 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.670
 no rinse for silky hair and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.220
 bright that soft and manageable 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.259
 now let's move on to step number 3 that 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.329
 is the hairstyle and to simplify the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.880
 age process of the desired style to 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.130
 camila is always good to use a 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.920
 unraveling spray that improves the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.170
 handling and make it easy to style and give 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.369
 the style that she wants because it's not 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.049
 what we want is the one that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.610
 camila wants to do or she is the one that goes 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.929
 to choose to know why I love 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.149
 also this name spray tangos 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.090
 because my mom does not know with me now 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.130
 anna you know the three steps create the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.510
 hair style you want is the part 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.030
 easiest of all 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.960
 begins by dividing the hair towards a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.240
 side then divide from ear to ear 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 in 9 the hair towards the hand of the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.250
 left and temporarily grab it 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.860
 after 9 the hair on the side 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.430
 right and join both sides in the part of 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.470
 back ensures the hair wrapped with 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.470
 a rubber band and add a tie 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 it's that easy moms have hair 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.400
 of our daughters should be a time 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.710
 to share with them significant 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.420
 to sit down with our little ones 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.030
 especially with your little camila and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.030
 make her feel beautiful like she is 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.159
