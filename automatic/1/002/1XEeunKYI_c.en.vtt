that<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.289> operating<00:00:19.590> without

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that it is not operating without

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.970 
that it is not operating without
electricity<00:00:20.609> when<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.630> put<00:00:21.930> together<00:00:22.260> these

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
electricity when I put together these

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.050 
electricity when I put together these
cables<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.500> not<00:00:25.650> working<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
cables you can see it's not working the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
cables you can see it's not working the
same<00:00:27.390> when<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.960> pull<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.470> cable<00:00:28.710> together

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
same when I pull this cable together

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.600 
same when I pull this cable together
with<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:29.939> cables<00:00:30.210> ok<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
with these cables ok you can see this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.410 
with these cables ok you can see this
cable<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> cable<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:35.579> operating

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
cable and this cable it's not operating

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.979 
cable and this cable it's not operating
because<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.559> generator<00:00:38.010> needs<00:00:38.520> first

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
because this generator needs first

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.740 
because this generator needs first
electric<00:00:39.989> impulse<00:00:40.379> let's<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.879> what

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
electric impulse let's have a look what

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.600 
electric impulse let's have a look what
we<00:00:42.780> will<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.829> put<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.370> together

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
we will have when we put it together

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.770 
we will have when we put it together
with<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> battery<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.570> put

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
with this battery you can see and I put

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
with this battery you can see and I put
butter<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.190> it's<00:00:50.190> already<00:00:51.050> working<00:00:52.219> let's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
butter in it's already working let's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
butter in it's already working let's
prepare<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:56.120> this<00:00:57.559> free<00:00:58.559> energy

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
prepare it for this free energy

let's<00:01:06.600> connect<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:09.510> try<00:01:09.810> what

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
let's connect it and now I will try what

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.850 
let's connect it and now I will try what
it<00:01:10.560> will<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.369> battery<00:01:12.260> ok<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.619> see

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it will do it is battery ok you can see

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370 
it will do it is battery ok you can see
it's<00:01:14.700> operating<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> say<00:01:15.810> ok<00:01:16.170> it's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it's operating now you say ok it's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
it's operating now you say ok it's
operating<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.610> electricity's<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
operating because the electricity's in

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
operating because the electricity's in
it<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.189> getting<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.420> energy<00:01:22.070> from

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it but now it's getting some energy from

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
it but now it's getting some energy from
this<00:01:23.189> battery<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> put<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> very

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this battery and then I put it very

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.490 
this battery and then I put it very
quickly<00:01:25.830> together<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:27.450> already<00:01:27.990> working

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
quickly together it's already working

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
quickly together it's already working
without<00:01:30.200> battery<00:01:32.090> ok<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.939> it's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
without battery ok so you see it's

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.330 
without battery ok so you see it's
already<00:01:36.180> operating<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.770> ok<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
already operating now you think ok the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.270 
already operating now you think ok the
varies<00:01:38.759> around<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.930> nowhere<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.560> nothing<00:01:41.130> like

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
varies around or nowhere is nothing like

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
varies around or nowhere is nothing like
this<00:01:41.460> no<00:01:42.150> wires<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.079> nothing

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
this no wires there is nothing

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.179 
this no wires there is nothing
underneath<00:01:44.009> its<00:01:44.909> operating<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.619> working

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
underneath its operating it's working

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.300 
underneath its operating it's working
like<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.840> there<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.869> no<00:01:49.170> accumulator<00:01:49.710> inside

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
like this there is no accumulator inside

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
like this there is no accumulator inside
it's<00:01:52.159> working<00:01:53.159> without<00:01:53.460> any<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> it
