00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.340
 so we have one party left 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.120
 this guitar solo part is her 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.649
 we will be engaged further 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:13.989
 let's listen to suomi in the mix 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.989
 along with the rest 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.700
 In general, of course, it can show that it is 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.820
 it sounds pretty good even 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.670
 despite the fact that no processing we 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.120
 this channel was not subjected but not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.780
 less in cosmetic processing this guitar 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.060
 anyway he needs particular 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.240
 we need to produce some kind of cosmetic 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.130
 qualification filtering 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.390
 necessarily 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 perhaps also dynamic 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500
 refinement but first we will deal 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.210
 screen versions will connect in the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.270
 first syllable parametric 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210
 a collider from to iws let it be 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.210
 searches 8 however guitar solo 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.450
 similar programs 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.160
 we can see 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.900
 enough 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 uneven 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.290
 with a clear rise 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 about 8 am 30 applications and randomly 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.320
 high speed leaving which with 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.920
 need pictures 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.390
 whole village of investment harmony 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.980
 medina 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.620
 low frequency factor 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.540
 rubbish so here there certainly is what 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.360
 correct 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.250
 and first of all 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 undoubtedly cut off 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.050
 make frequencies 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.050
 then tied with fatherland 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.289
 periodontitis she 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.129
 because he is well read 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.679
 and now let's adjusted 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.309
 some of her robertson 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.879
 we did it 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.479
 with everyone else 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.479
 besides 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.149
 technical processing 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
 many agribusiness financiers 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 in october next lane 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 as a result 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.279
 but 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.009
 until 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.009
 but 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
 also how important 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.330
 Lukashenko has only left us 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
 Russia is exploring the remaining area 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.330
 amount of korea 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.409
 for this business 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.409
 ask conceded cut out 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.259
 add immediately 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.029
 on the track because we are all the same 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:00.120
 at the monument part of the frequencies 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.759
 together from the beginning of the year 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.759
 lowered 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.370
 yes now we are more expensive 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.379
 intertwined 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.240
 so abruptly and will be collected a lot 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.240
 innovation development repair 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.620
 but the situation is in 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.520
 the future 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.710
 gave her 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.710
 after serving dynamo 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.539
 from regional dvd astana 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.779
 all nato we can quite finish 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:44.790
 in such situation 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.790
 and in the next lesson let's get started 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.469
 with you weapon 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.259
 dynamic processing here 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.339
 of course we can see that the dynamics 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.019
 fairly even new is not perfect and 

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:57.269
 again not that concern about what the compressor 

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.679
 This is not only device for the US This dynamics 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.189
 mink which can be brought 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.689
 achieve some more saturation 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.059
 density and clarity and sound in this 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.049
 case we of course smear 

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:09.939
 absolutely no good finish this 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.229
 lesson and next we will do compression
