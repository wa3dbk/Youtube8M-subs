these<00:03:05.840> mumbles<00:03:06.530> off<00:03:06.849> so<00:03:07.849> we're<00:03:08.000> going<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.239> put

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
these mumbles off so we're going to put

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.720 
these mumbles off so we're going to put
the<00:03:10.040> mo<00:03:10.220> more<00:03:10.459> than<00:03:10.489> here<00:03:12.190> keep<00:03:13.190> some<00:03:13.489> distance

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the mo more than here keep some distance

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.800 
the mo more than here keep some distance
while<00:03:14.269> pulling<00:03:14.599> these<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.230> don't<00:03:16.569> stick<00:03:17.569> them

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
while pulling these so don't stick them

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.080 
while pulling these so don't stick them
too<00:03:18.080> much<00:03:18.319> with<00:03:18.590> each<00:03:18.620> other<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.780> we'll<00:03:20.930> load

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
too much with each other so we'll load

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.910 
too much with each other so we'll load
half<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.299> these<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.019> tray<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.709> then

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
half of these on this tray and then

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.949 
half of these on this tray and then
we're<00:03:25.100> going<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.400> do<00:03:25.519> half<00:03:25.820> on<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.299> next<00:03:26.750> one

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
we're going to do half on the next one

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.400 
we're going to do half on the next one
then<00:03:27.560> I'm<00:03:27.859> going<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.130> set<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.000> second<00:03:29.480> tray<00:03:30.109> on

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
then I'm going to set the second tray on

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.009 
then I'm going to set the second tray on
that<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.010> we're<00:03:31.880> going<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.180> add<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.840> other

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
that and we're going to add the other

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.580 
that and we're going to add the other
half<00:03:33.170> right<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.250> there<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:35.840> will<00:03:36.290> take

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
half right in there so that will take

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.680 
half right in there so that will take
the<00:03:36.799> other<00:03:36.980> half

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.890 

so<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.290> got<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.220> ideas<00:03:44.700> just<00:03:45.090> put<00:03:45.420> these<00:03:45.570> up

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
so you got the ideas just put these up

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.250 
so you got the ideas just put these up
in<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.160> close<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.910> leave<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:49.050> about

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
in there and close it leave it for about

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.750 
in there and close it leave it for about

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
15 minutes

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.880 
15 minutes
