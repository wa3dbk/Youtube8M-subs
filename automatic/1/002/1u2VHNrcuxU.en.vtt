hey guys is chris i just got a new 500
gigabyte<00:00:04.319> momentus<00:00:05.310> xt<00:00:05.750> hard<00:00:06.750> drive<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.170> it's

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
gigabyte momentus xt hard drive and it's

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.720 
gigabyte momentus xt hard drive and it's
actually<00:00:07.440> not<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.069> hard<00:00:08.250> drive<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.580> just

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
actually not just a hard drive it's just

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.419 
actually not just a hard drive it's just
a<00:00:08.820> hybrid<00:00:09.510> drive<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.530> both<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.980> hard<00:00:11.190> drive

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
a hybrid drive so it's both a hard drive

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.980 
a hybrid drive so it's both a hard drive
and<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.759> solid<00:00:11.969> state<00:00:12.240> drive<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.750> there's<00:00:13.670> 496

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
and a solid state drive so there's 496

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.330 
and a solid state drive so there's 496
gigabytes<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> hard<00:00:16.320> drive<00:00:16.500> space<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.949> then<00:00:17.039> 4

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
gigabytes of hard drive space and then 4

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.519 
gigabytes of hard drive space and then 4
gigabytes<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.539> solid-state<00:00:18.869> drive<00:00:19.289> disk

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
gigabytes of solid-state drive disk

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.220 
gigabytes of solid-state drive disk
space<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.730> pretty<00:00:20.939> cool<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.449> so

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
space so it's pretty cool and so

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.019 
space so it's pretty cool and so
basically<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.830> caches<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> lot<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.699> things<00:00:23.820> on

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
basically just caches a lot of things on

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
basically just caches a lot of things on
the<00:00:24.150> SSD<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> use<00:00:25.439> most<00:00:25.680> often<00:00:26.010> like

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the SSD that you use most often like

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.849 
the SSD that you use most often like
your<00:00:26.550> boot<00:00:26.760> files<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.199> most<00:00:28.410> commonly

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
your boot files and the most commonly

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.710 
your boot files and the most commonly
used<00:00:28.920> applications<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.090> files<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.689> your

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
used applications and files in your

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
used applications and files in your
computer<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.769> pretty<00:00:31.859> cool<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> I'm

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
computer so it's pretty cool and I'm

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
computer so it's pretty cool and I'm
just<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> quick<00:00:33.090> restart<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
just going to do a quick restart of it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.680 
just going to do a quick restart of it
so<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.520> power<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.450> new

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
going to change let's see the difference

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.780 
going to change let's see the difference
between<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.680> time<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.370> launch<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
between this this time that launch the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.070 
between this this time that launch the
application<00:02:33.940> what's<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.690> happen<00:02:34.930> with

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
application what's going to happen with

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.420 
application what's going to happen with
the<00:02:35.350> next<00:02:35.590> time<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.770> opened<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the next time that opened up the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.370 
the next time that opened up the
application<00:02:36.540> before<00:02:37.540> i<00:02:37.750> got<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.050> drive<00:02:38.350> i

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
application before i got this drive i

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.500 
application before i got this drive i
was<00:02:38.680> hoping<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.040> save<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:39.460> for<00:02:39.670> an<00:02:39.760> SSD<00:02:40.240> drive

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
was hoping to save up for an SSD drive

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.290 
was hoping to save up for an SSD drive
but<00:02:40.840> um<00:02:41.080> if<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.950> know<00:02:42.040> anything<00:02:42.220> about<00:02:42.370> SSD

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
but um if you know anything about SSD

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.200 
but um if you know anything about SSD
drives<00:02:43.540> are<00:02:43.720> very<00:02:43.930> expensive<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.650> i<00:02:45.490> really

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
drives are very expensive and i really

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.550 
drives are very expensive and i really
wasn't<00:02:46.420> looking<00:02:46.750> forward<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.140> paying<00:02:47.350> you

wasn't looking forward to paying you
know<00:02:47.650> six<00:02:47.980> hundred<00:02:48.280> dollars<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.820> 250

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
know six hundred dollars for 250

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
gigabyte drive that mean I get a 500

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.890 
gigabyte drive that mean I get a 500
gigabyte<00:02:52.960> hard<00:02:53.320> drive<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.310> lot<00:02:54.790> less<00:02:55.060> so

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
gigabyte hard drive for a lot less so

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.410 
gigabyte hard drive for a lot less so
when<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.440> figured<00:02:56.980> about<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.640> drive<00:02:57.910> was<00:02:58.180> very

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
when I figured about the drive was very

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.060 
when I figured about the drive was very
very<00:02:58.630> excited<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.260> test<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.620> out<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.890> I<00:02:59.950> was

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
very excited to test it out and I was

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.280 
very excited to test it out and I was
very<00:03:00.130> happy<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.750> was<00:03:01.870> something<00:03:02.050> at

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
very happy that there was something at

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.810 
very happy that there was something at
my<00:03:02.440> price<00:03:02.709> range<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:03.190> would<00:03:03.310> speed<00:03:03.520> up<00:03:03.580> my

my price range that would speed up my

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.850 
my price range that would speed up my
computer<00:03:04.000> because<00:03:04.420> previously<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.380> was<00:03:05.650> using

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
computer because previously I was using

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.640 
computer because previously I was using
the<00:03:06.040> stock<00:03:06.310> hard<00:03:06.580> drive<00:03:06.820> which<00:03:07.090> was<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.650> 5400

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the stock hard drive which was a 5400

the stock hard drive which was a 5400
RPM<00:03:09.040> drive<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.850> that<00:03:10.450> was<00:03:10.630> pretty<00:03:10.930> slow<00:03:11.290> at

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
RPM drive so that was pretty slow at

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.490 
RPM drive so that was pretty slow at
comparison<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.489> even<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.940> 7200<00:03:13.810> RPM<00:03:14.260> drive

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500

7200 RPM drive the SSD Drive in this
thing<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.330> monstrous<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:23.350> very<00:03:23.620> very<00:03:23.890> fast

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
