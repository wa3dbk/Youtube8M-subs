 amplify the sound 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.410
 some cables are supplied 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.470

 allergy to the speakers allow. to play the music on 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.900
 someone on alp directly was through these boxes you want to mine by modifying 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.380

 ferrero is a European regulatory spa that exists. 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.150
 here we are with our ipad 2 which we will now connect to the headphones 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.400

 the intensity of the native sound on act 2 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.380
 let's pass - volume now we'll try 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.030
 to use the speakers so we don't change the volume 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.010
 excel there is nothing but these crates at 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.240
 they need power then beauty sessions with a computer ad 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.829
 example just plug in 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.579
 between mortgage and if god in the coffers. at the PC 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.979
 et voila. they will work without problems in the case of a jerk the pope is 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.969
 however, I need a minimum supply 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.479
 alternatively 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.759
 you can still use 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.769
 the batteries 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.779
 that can be entered 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.359
 in here 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.989
 farmerama guarded by automatically feeding the tills without resorting 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.599
 to the Portuguese d 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.629
 however if you want to use a little trick available this case 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.449
 only for users to the father 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.829
 you can resort 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.839

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.069
 room kit 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.069
 connected camera kit indeed 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.200
 we can also link the photo with seby 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.769
 in the boxes 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 in such a way by car - well 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.689
 as you see 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.129
 I'm already on 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.099
 now we also connect the cable instead of the gf headphones 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.689
 rt the speakers are now already active 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.000
 the positions I love up front 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.080
 right for 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.059
 let you see 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.399
 and now we launch equally with the same volume 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.649
 more or less 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.419
 me the same production song 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.919
 from the speakers 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.509
 I don't know if the binge drinking binge drinking binge drinking binge drinking binge 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:48.689
 like to appreciate the morning however in mind the quality of sleep hotel 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.359
 volume is definitely higher 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.359
 let's try increasing the youtube mass ii 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.579
 ii 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.569
 this is a small problem that occasionally occurs when 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.089
 we use this camera connection kit trick when it increases 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.120
 excessive volume 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:19.289
 often that message comes out long ago. that is the accessory is not 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.530
 fused is not compatible is no longer available because it uses too much 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.960
 current 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.150
 as already mentioned to solve this problem. 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
 just disconnect the camera connection kit 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.319
 connects to the monte sant'angelo 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.610
 lower the volume of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.620
 meaning of life that food though 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.680
 fail to do that much 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 on the speakers 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.590
 on the quality of sleep 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.550
 distance between two useful numbers we can, aching 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.520
 through this revenue thing 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 present on the boxes mm 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.610
 now we'll have to have the speakers connected to the bar. always damage water like 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.089
 power supply 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:09.389
 Eritrea hear some of the joy on the steering wheel 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.889
 we have an aifon 4 here now you turn on 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.029
 and let's start the reproduction of an Easter song 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.589
 implement maximum volume 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.159
 this evening 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.069
 also I now have always the connected speakers powered by micro sd from 32 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.339
 let's share it 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.339
 the headphones with the cable 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.569
 and as you can see there are active headphones, let's try to start 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.099
 in this house not to be there 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.729
 however problems because appointments from not little solution 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.139
 photo of joy cel. 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.819
 that of using water as 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.819
 as a power supply 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:16.189
 list of places 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.490
 surgery 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.529
 the problem is always the same when starting with a very high volume 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.460
 until the natural end 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.780
 jump let's say current supply stops 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.580
 penis penis 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.580
 set the volume to maximum I'm in mind. 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.369
 gets lost 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:41.369
 completely 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.710

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.710
 where the fuck are they from 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:00.970
 as already mentioned that you have the most comfortable solution and that company is using 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:04.259
 precisely the battery compartment to insert 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:09.409
 already. the batteries inside one of the two speakers and then power 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:12.180
 the entire system autonomously without power 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.990
 hard work have to sd and therefore to the connection for example of the hakuna 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.180
 matata 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.980
 if a. rizzo you haven't done anyway that of the camera connection kit e 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.939
