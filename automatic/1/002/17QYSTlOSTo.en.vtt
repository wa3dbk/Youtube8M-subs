00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the third series of road tourism 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.089
 in rafaela he put in the front row the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 Torino by Norberto Fontana and Nestor 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.250
 girolami with green or ere evaporated 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.650
 both were on par but without now I 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 it was on the outside floor the grass even 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.880
 suddenly causing a big 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.500
 accident 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 girolami impact with mariano altuna and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.630
 both they were violently against 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.460
 the wall after what always a poor 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 containment of tires that do not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.630
 they were tied and the tires flew by 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.399
 the air 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.800
 norberto long we are very similar 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.510
 we get to 1 equal and when I see that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 I get up I find the position to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.320
 the pair or I did not make any effort 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 to throw me I have nothing when then 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.789
 but I was scared yesterday when it was a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 start because I saw that you always have to 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.550
 be a little bit that endorsed for him 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 can enter ethical partner did not give him little 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.320
 and it never happened I sought to overcome it to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 norberto when I went outside try 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.879
 surpass what I lift to save myself and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 Norberto also raises and I have left 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.360
 the rope for the right will have very 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 past 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.550
 if I go with him to the error or how he is going 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.500
 outside I think there's a contractor there and 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.780
 he spoke we just talked two together I think 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 that was a maneuver to the limit 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 risky but without luck because the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.330
 problem is generated when the car enters 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.050
 the track if I had not lost a couple of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.910
 positions and nothing else too much for a 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.770
 series in which everything is very cold 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.600
 where is the start where is the chicane 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.940
 when he runs he is not only a chicane 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.800
 fast where a funnel there are six turns 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.210
 ahead there are many possibilities of 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.370
 step in the race the first round by 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 what he tells me tube 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.000
 space and sufficient evaluation 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 as to be able to try better 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.570
 there was no need at that moment a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.510
 car in there we enter is very 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.220
 unfortunate the band maneuver that we 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.560
 it took a terrible fright we took it out 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 cheap recontra put at risk all 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.160
 cars well back because inside reviewed 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.840
 a little bit for a year and that way 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.539
 late 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.700
 that they become aware that lives are going on 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.700
 in with a conductive error looking 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.739
 one overrun was an excess you could 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.170
 have avoided because there are pilots that 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.769
 they hold directly there nolan 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.510
 and an unfortunate sporting maneuver 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.250
 they have to act there is code enters track 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.459
 is sanctioned with date how many dates a 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.459
 year
