00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
first main difference when you look at
it<00:00:18.960> these<00:00:19.470> sides<00:00:19.770> are<00:00:19.980> different<00:00:20.430> not<00:00:20.939> this

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
it these sides are different not this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.900 
it these sides are different not this
size<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.600> sides<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.490> legion

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
size these sides you can see with legion

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
size these sides you can see with legion
oide<00:00:24.090> there's<00:00:24.900> these<00:00:25.109> weird<00:00:25.350> mythic<00:00:25.800> designs

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
oide there's these weird mythic designs

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.529 
oide there's these weird mythic designs
and<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.760> dos<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.090> more<00:00:27.300> kind<00:00:27.480> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and we have to dos it's more kind of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
and we have to dos it's more kind of
like<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> modern<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.650> parts<00:00:29.279> blue<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like a modern and that parts blue and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
like a modern and that parts blue and
that<00:00:29.939> part<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.689> regular<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.590> hair

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
that part is like regular the hair

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.240 
that part is like regular the hair
coloring<00:00:32.989> okay<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.260> instead<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.649> these<00:00:34.860> lines

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
coloring okay so instead of these lines

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.569 
coloring okay so instead of these lines
on<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.710> instead<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> all

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
on like all this here instead of all

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.680 
on like all this here instead of all
these<00:00:38.760> lines<00:00:39.469> you're<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:41.579> gonna<00:00:41.700> on

these lines you're gonna you're gonna on
hexa<00:00:43.140> DOS

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
hexa DOS

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400 
hexa DOS
they're<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.070> modern<00:00:44.940> hexagons<00:00:45.629> so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
they're kind of like modern hexagons so

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
they're kind of like modern hexagons so
now<00:00:47.070> I'll<00:00:47.309> open<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.920> okay<00:00:49.950> first<00:00:50.219> main

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
now I'll open them up okay first main

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.389 
now I'll open them up okay first main
difference<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.860> heads<00:00:53.129> are

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
difference when you see the heads are

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
difference when you see the heads are
not<00:00:53.699> spring-loaded<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.320> Legion<00:00:55.559> oyd

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
not spring-loaded like on Legion oyd

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
not spring-loaded like on Legion oyd
hexa<00:00:56.280> dos<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> second<00:00:57.660> main<00:00:57.780> difference

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hexa dos it is second main difference

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.170 
hexa dos it is second main difference
when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> look<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.539> hexa<00:01:00.539> dos<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:01.129> the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
when you look at it on hexa dos all the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
when you look at it on hexa dos all the
attributes<00:01:03.180> symbols<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> traps<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
attributes symbols for the traps and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.560 
attributes symbols for the traps and
since<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> trap<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> attribute<00:01:06.210> symbols

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
since to trap all the attribute symbols

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.050 
since to trap all the attribute symbols
are<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.229> place

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
are in one place

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
are in one place
regionally<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.420> Python<00:01:09.840> tiss<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
regionally just like Python tiss one is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.490 
regionally just like Python tiss one is
on<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> side<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> side<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:15.500> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
on that side one is on that side so and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.310 
on that side one is on that side so and
all<00:01:16.799> no<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> liège<00:01:18.990> annoyed

on<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.560> end<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.549> left<00:01:44.909> side<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
on the end of the left side and right so

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.950 
on the end of the left side and right so
there's<00:01:47.579> definitely<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.000> lot<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> differences

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
there's definitely a lot of differences

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.130 
there's definitely a lot of differences
yeah<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> there's<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:50.970> peg<00:01:51.840> there

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
yeah and there's just little peg there

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.260 
yeah and there's just little peg there
that<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.119> are

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that you have to get out but they are

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.990 
that you have to get out but they are
both<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.979> thicker<00:01:55.979> than<00:01:56.250> Python<00:01:56.670> sees<00:01:56.850> even

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
both very thicker than Python sees even

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
both very thicker than Python sees even
though<00:01:57.210> price<00:01:57.360> antis<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.930> longer<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.590> for

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
though price antis is longer and for

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
though price antis is longer and for
some<00:01:58.950> strange<00:01:59.189> reason<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.880> shows<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.299> 3<00:02:00.689> right

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
some strange reason it shows at 3 right

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.370 
some strange reason it shows at 3 right
there

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
