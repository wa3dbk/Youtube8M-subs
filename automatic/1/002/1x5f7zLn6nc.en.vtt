dobar dan
('Hello' in Croatian)

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:24.601
I was longing to open this
and I finally made it

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.901
I'm sure there is a gum inside

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:32.401
No, it is a soda pop.
Oh, really?

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.434
The soda pop is clover-shaped every time

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:39.801
I wonder why

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:52.467
Will you cut all the parts, Lena?

00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:55.601
I took a part in a moment

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:58.167
Oh, it seems too small

00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:01.567
You can take larger one.
It's easier

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.501
It's hard indeed

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.567
Twinkle Star Symphony!

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:18.567
Will you put the sticker here?

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:27.601
I finished putting the stickers!

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:31.701
Now I only have to assemble them

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.101
Will you put this in?

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:02.134
Oh, yes

00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:05.667
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:10.901
I'm supposed to put this ring

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:19.667
The real one makes sounds when pushing keys

00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:32.367
Wait a bit
