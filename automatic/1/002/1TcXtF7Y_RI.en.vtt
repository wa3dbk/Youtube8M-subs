00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
on 5.0.1 firmware now this is quite

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.580 
on 5.0.1 firmware now this is quite
possibly<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> most<00:00:13.679> easiest<00:00:14.490> method<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.150> date

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
possibly the most easiest method to date

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
possibly the most easiest method to date
there's<00:00:16.590> no<00:00:16.980> middleman<00:00:17.369> there's<00:00:17.730> no<00:00:17.910> server

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
there's no middleman there's no server

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.970 
there's no middleman there's no server
that's<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> clog<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.500> everyone

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that's going to clog up so everyone

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.070 
that's going to clog up so everyone
watching<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.430> video<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:21.330> use<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.779> method

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
watching this video can use this method

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.950 
watching this video can use this method
and<00:00:22.470> Siri<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:23.699> always<00:00:24.119> work<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.750> you

and Siri will always work for you
doesn't<00:00:25.439> matter<00:00:25.619> how<00:00:25.800> many<00:00:25.859> people<00:00:26.550> use<00:00:27.210> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
doesn't matter how many people use this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.070 
doesn't matter how many people use this
method

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
method

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.099 
method
what<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> its<00:00:29.460> base<00:00:29.910> abase<00:00:30.269> o'clock<00:00:30.869> in

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
what it is is its base abase o'clock in

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.860 
what it is is its base abase o'clock in
so<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.830> uses<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> Siri<00:00:32.550> server<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.210> connect<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so it uses the Siri server to connect to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.650 
so it uses the Siri server to connect to
Google<00:00:34.110> API<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.579> again<00:00:35.910> everyone<00:00:36.510> that's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
Google API so again everyone that's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
Google API so again everyone that's
watching<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.020> video<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.590> use<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
watching this video can use this and it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.510 
watching this video can use this and it
will<00:00:38.850> never<00:00:39.059> clog<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.620> guys<00:00:40.829> follow<00:00:41.340> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
will never clog up so guys follow this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.459 
will never clog up so guys follow this
method<00:00:41.730> real<00:00:42.239> simple<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.780> effective<00:00:42.989> of
