00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.289
 welcome woman asko stupid me 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.539
 I am glad that you are interviewing today 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.880
 may she have an incredible moment ago 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.460
 inspiring lecture held topic 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.449
 self-esteem of msa a whole 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.930
 important topic 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.040
 she herself as a power woman and super 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.570
 Speakers who already have a lot in the 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.700
 television has occurred with 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.559
 of course no problems she 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.050
 act very very consciously paired with 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.550
 a lot of humor my question it 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.980
 But there are also shy people 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.800
 and certainly also among the mfs like 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.440
 is that if someone is shy what 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.969
 what can you do against it so first 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.679
 I do not recommend shyness 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.390
 to look as a character error 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.829
 So it's only shy 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.510
 shy that is innate in the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.069
 usually there are more people and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.069
 louder i belong to the louder backs 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.530
 also live and the second is too 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.829
 distinguish between more than 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.079
 Private citizen 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.809
 so i am the girl the woman the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.690
 shy and me in my role 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.760
 in practice for my experience 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.310
 that you can work that out in the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.160
 practice a different role so play 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.650
 to learn to approach people 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.480
 learn to look at people 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.530
 When I see it someone needs help 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.780
 to approach 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.850
 it's a learning factor you can say 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.470
 Learning everything can also be learned in the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.510
 professional do not roll timid 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.890
 and be privately you can do anyway 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.740
 what you want and can be as you want 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.150
 but we can train it there 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.890
 kind of such a special tip 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.270
 I'm shy now and like chest 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.760
 out or what 's there somewhere 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.780
 trick would be great for me but that is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.770
 most important that I man 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 see who stands there and I believe that one 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.290
 Secret tip trick trick is the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.430
 to draw attention away from me 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.170
 up the people who need me 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.150
 So if I shy but is not 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.890
 it just does not matter there is a human 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.500
 he needs my help now and me 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.780
 so i am focussing my 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.610
 attention to other people 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.080
 and not even think about it after I'm 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.460
 i am shy now but dare me 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.440
 but not now he needs it 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.060
 my attention and foot and i believe 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.269
 I am firmly convinced that you can 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.269
 work out
