00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 and what killing is presented 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.500
 I am kike mateo and I present to you a 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.480
 simple tutorial to have bags 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 tight, you may remember the bags 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 simple and now I present a way 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 more economical and better to have bags 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.789
 tight in the home and for that we are going 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.570
 to need a knife 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.579
 and a plastic bottle and clear a bag 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.710
 of plastic and let's start 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.289
 using the knife to cut the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.350
 neck of the bottle in this way what 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.719
 closest we can have of the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.629
 cover for example more or less until 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:43.500
 this height and we're going to cut out with 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:48.420
 careful not to cut our fingers 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 thus ready well as 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.330
 let's have the cover now just 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 what we need to do is open it and 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.440
 do the following we take the bag that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 we will use to store food 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.270
 or what we want to keep and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.860
 we introduce them and once the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.170
 we have introduced we are going to introduce 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 this part of the bag inside the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.360
 neck of the bottle in this way 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.260
 until you get them from the other side very 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.160
 well, well 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.160
 in this way 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.479
 until all of them come out because of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.560
 this mode we now use the cover of the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.010
 bottle to screw it together with the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010
 bags 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.040
 to screw it together with the bag 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.040
 this mode will be saved in a way 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 hermetic 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 and so they can keep them in the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.070
 refrigerator or wherever the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.259
 want to save and that's how we can 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.630
 have this several options to save 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.430
 our food hermetically and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.570
 totally free because these bags 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.600
 you can give them to us in the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.930
 supermarket and we also have another 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.959
 more advantageous truth option than if 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.130
 we buy the most advantageous bags that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.820
 the ziploc bags because 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.390
 having this device the limit of 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.920
 The size of the bag is practically not 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 there is no limit to the size of the bag 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.210
 because we can use any bag for 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.670
 bigger than that and use this 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.670
 device to close hermetically 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410
 for example 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.330
 we have a big t - shirt bag and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.510
 we can enter everything we want 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.850
 there rice and food 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.730
 sandwiches whatever it is all together and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.460
 we simply add it and introduce it 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.220
 inside the neck of the bottle and this 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.260
 it's the biggest advantage that we're going to 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.420
 to have 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.790
 that if we bought this the bags 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.829
 commercials of the cycle bags because 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.959
 the bags and jobs are generally not 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.280
 so big and if they buy them big they are 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.020
 of greater the price and already just like that 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.030
 twist moss 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.570
 and they will give us a large hermetic bag 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.570
 In the home 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.230
 and this was all my children I hope that 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.540
 you liked the video share what 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.720
 criticize what you like and until the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.720
 next 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.040
 I present you
