00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.359 
don't like about it is the bottom is
kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> big<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:11.040> took<00:01:11.189> these

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
kind of big right here if you took these

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.440 
kind of big right here if you took these
out<00:01:11.869> then<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.170> would<00:01:13.320> look<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.010> nice

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
out then it would look really nice

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.499 
out then it would look really nice
perfect<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.799> these<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:17.360> are<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> way

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
perfect but these things are in the way

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
perfect but these things are in the way
that's<00:01:21.509> why<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.799> only<00:01:22.979> thing<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.400> don't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that's why that's the only thing I don't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.960 
that's why that's the only thing I don't
like<00:01:23.729> about<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> rest<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.590> love<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
like about it but the rest I love so to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.499 
like about it but the rest I love so to
transform<00:01:27.210> him<00:01:27.659> first<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.119> unbend<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.360> this

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
transform him first you unbend to this

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
transform him first you unbend to this
so<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.110> straight<00:01:31.530> line<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so it's like a straight line and if I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
so it's like a straight line and if I
did<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> robot<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.960> vehicle<00:01:34.049> most<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
did this and robot and vehicle most that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
did this and robot and vehicle most that
it's<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:34.920> stretched<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.729> being<00:01:36.329> fed

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's all stretched it's not being fed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's all stretched it's not being fed
then<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.070> look<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.250> weird<00:01:38.640> that's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
then it would look pretty weird that's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.249 
then it would look pretty weird that's
why<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.110> anyways<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259

in the top his arms his hands and the
cockpit<00:03:08.370> things<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:09.150> where<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.690> should<00:03:09.720> be

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
cockpit things right where it should be

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.990 
cockpit things right where it should be
on<00:03:10.200> his<00:03:10.319> body<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.550> usually<00:03:11.940> should

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
on his body because it usually should

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.559 
on his body because it usually should
probably<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.629> little<00:03:12.690> bit<00:03:12.989> more<00:03:13.200> higher<00:03:14.569> but

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
probably be a little bit more higher but

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.460 
probably be a little bit more higher but
still<00:03:16.790> his<00:03:17.790> legs<00:03:18.150> are<00:03:18.569> nice<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.319> in

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
still his legs are nice so in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.589 
still his legs are nice so in
articulation<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.220> could<00:03:20.370> move<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.209> appear

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
articulation you could move this appear

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.539 
articulation you could move this appear
and<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.709> move<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.550> now<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.330> could<00:03:24.569> and

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
and you can move this now you could and

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.240 
and you can move this now you could and
the<00:03:26.549> knee<00:03:26.760> will<00:03:27.540> been<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.129> move

the knee will been here and you can move
the<00:03:29.400> foot<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.940> lots<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.510> articulation<00:03:31.110> into

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the foot so lots of articulation into

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.580 
the foot so lots of articulation into
the<00:03:31.290> legs<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:32.310> poseable<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:34.110> legs<00:03:34.319> and

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
the arms too you could move the shoulder

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.490 
the arms too you could move the shoulder
and<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.450> put<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.720> front<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.290> then

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
and you can put this in front and then

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.440 
and you can put this in front and then
you<00:03:43.819> can<00:03:44.819> make<00:03:45.090> him<00:03:45.209> reach<00:03:45.390> out<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.720> grab<00:03:45.959> you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
so yeah that's lots of possibility on

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.350 
so yeah that's lots of possibility on
the<00:03:51.540> arms<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:51.930> well<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.909> head<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.239> could

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
the arms as well and the head you could

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.970 
the arms as well and the head you could
just<00:03:54.540> turn<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.230> could<00:03:55.409> turn<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.799> head

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980

just turn them you could turn the head
and<00:03:56.400> that's<00:03:56.549> all<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:56.939> head<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.209> can't

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
and that's all for the head you can't

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.210 
and that's all for the head you can't
move<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.689> up<00:03:57.810> or<00:03:57.930> down<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.750> end<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.409> detail

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
move it up or down the end in detail

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.030 
move it up or down the end in detail
really<00:04:02.580> nice<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.689> also<00:04:03.959> here's<00:04:04.680> some

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
really nice and also here's some

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.940 
really nice and also here's some
something<00:04:05.640> cool<00:04:05.909> about<00:04:05.939> him<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.480> yes<00:04:07.409> is<00:04:07.620> jets

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
something cool about him is yes is jets

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.220 
something cool about him is yes is jets
in<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.159> back<00:04:08.430> usually<00:04:09.420> they<00:04:09.959> should<00:04:10.110> be

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
in the back usually they should be

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.339 
in the back usually they should be
facing<00:04:10.470> down<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:12.049> couldn't<00:04:13.049> do<00:04:13.200> that

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
facing down but I couldn't do that

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.990 
facing down but I couldn't do that
because<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:14.010> there<00:04:14.189> would<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:14.340> enough<00:04:14.730> room

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
because then there would be enough room

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.759 
because then there would be enough room
for<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:16.130> no<00:04:17.130> legs<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.850> go<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:19.229> at<00:04:19.410> least<00:04:19.560> it's

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
for the no legs to go but at least it's

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.010 
for the no legs to go but at least it's
kind<00:04:20.009> of<00:04:20.040> like<00:04:20.220> Jets

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
kind of like Jets

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.020 
kind of like Jets
so<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.110> get<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.290> goal<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.560> guess<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.700> could<00:04:23.850> go

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
so you get the goal I guess you could go

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.680 
so you get the goal I guess you could go
this<00:04:24.240> way

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
this way

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.370 
this way
slam<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.710> wall<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:28.340> its<00:04:29.340> size<00:04:29.580> converts<00:04:30.380> so

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
slam to the wall in its size converts so

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.890 
slam to the wall in its size converts so
here's<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.190> fallen<00:04:32.790> if<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.330> saw<00:04:33.510> this<00:04:33.690> little

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
here's the fallen if you saw this little

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.670 
here's the fallen if you saw this little
stick<00:04:34.260> here

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
stick here

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.500 
stick here
there<00:04:35.400> he<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.520> next<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.940> fallen<00:04:36.330> he's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
there he is next to the fallen he's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.810 
there he is next to the fallen he's
smaller<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.590> he<00:04:37.650> shouldn't<00:04:37.920> be<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.250> that's

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
smaller and he shouldn't be so that's

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.440 
smaller and he shouldn't be so that's
good<00:04:39.530> here<00:04:40.530> he<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.710> next<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:41.040> Megatron<00:04:41.450> he's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
good here he is next to Megatron he's

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.720 
good here he is next to Megatron he's
taller<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.170> do<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:44.670> not<00:04:44.910> good<00:04:46.280> well<00:04:47.280> looks

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
taller and do it's not good well looks

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.340 
taller and do it's not good well looks
like<00:04:47.790> measure<00:04:48.090> good<00:04:48.300> Megatron<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.990> be<00:04:49.110> taller

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
like measure good Megatron to be taller

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.850 
like measure good Megatron to be taller
but<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.950> guess<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.730> just<00:04:50.760> couldn't<00:04:51.150> do<00:04:51.270> that

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
but I guess I just couldn't do that

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.790 
but I guess I just couldn't do that
so<00:04:52.860> it's<00:04:53.070> Megatron's<00:04:53.580> fault<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:55.410> next<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.740> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
so it's Megatron's fault so next to the
