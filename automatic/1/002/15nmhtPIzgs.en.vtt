00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670
 m 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 we 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.070
 Why 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 at 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.610
 and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.119
 we are on the urrugne post them and 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.000
 we observe the migration of northern pigeons 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.950
 at 124 tons so threatening the counts 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.179
 the 15th of October and it is 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.890
 that today we are on a 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.390
 day where there is passage where we are 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.759
 on a post where there is the passage in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.409
 phase 6 1 in a strong southerly wind 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.299
 there are four metering stations we have 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.280
 more posts inside so arnéguy 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.890
 then evoking the room and we had a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.329
 on the ledge the contest organized by 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 the gif which is the investigative group 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.240
 wildlife 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590
 we are in partnership so it's very 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.030
 federations of aquitaine hunters 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.500
 Midi Pyrenees who participate who 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.450
 come do the counts on these 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.159
 four positions and we also have support or 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.039
 of the agricultural school of saint pee on 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.110
 so level with trainees bac 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.459
 pro so they come to give a shot of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.079
 hand to train in the technique of 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.470
 counting on the four positions of 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.470
 contagion 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.170
 the others we have here 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 so count on these four posts because 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.250
 that it crosses the Pyrenees and they are 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.870
 will spend the winter so south west of 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.069
 Spain and Portugal and some 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.840
 which does not cross the Pyrenees but 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.220
 who also stays in winter a penny 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.750
 west of france so to 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.299
 Landes departments mainly 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.920
 gironde at the gers pyrénées atlantiques 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.959
 from one year to another on October 15 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.480
 to geese have each year since 99 we 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.430
 count these birds we estimate its birds 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.780
 to have a trend of evolution of 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.099
 these populations know if the population 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.370
 migrating is on the rise or at the 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.530
 drop 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.260
 and since 99 in fact one realizes 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.000
 that the united population gratis on the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.019
 passes of the Pyrenees is to stability and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.430
 then after that we also do the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.650
 season censuses so in winter 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.209
 on the wintering sites so in 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.530
 December and January in the south east of 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.730
 France but also to Portugal and a 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 complement of all this program 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.329
 also creates markers of 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.470
 argos tags that we follow this year 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.150
 we said we like a little bit of 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.549
 delay in migration to around 15 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.840
 days late and with the birds on 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.700
 which we actually put the tags 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.109
 we realized that there is also 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.609
 delay because some in the usa in 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.379
 course on a breeding site and the 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.180
 iii who are still on the site and he has 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.650
 one who has a tag and who finds himself 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.419
 currently in France that is part of 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.680
 Austria and through germany 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.359
 He is currently in France since 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.959
 yesterday so here is the step still ready 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.959
 for the worst 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.920
 and 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.550
 and 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.269
 we use juice even from long views 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.680
 it depends on the sites the technique 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.360
 Collective and large flights with 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.430
 little hops the accounts up 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.870
 about a hundred birds and after 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.549
 once you have players passing 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.840
 so the eye also get used to 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.000
 technicians they're used to 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.380
 count flights of 596 years in my 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.289
 anchor and realized so if we count a 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.330
 parking where the reporter this part 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.460
 as many times as confined to the role 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.199
 to estimate the role in port to the cir 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.460
 ratings small votes it's a 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.590
 counting is today these breaks 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.419
 we had some beautiful stolen 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.650
 more than two thousand birds so that's 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.650
 good taste skin 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.139
 Oh 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.480
 1 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.419
 the passage where are done more on the 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.340
 coast at the corner between the street nor the cornice 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.810
 in return is done over sea 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.400
 because in fact I think wine in 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.050
 sea ​​is a little weaker 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.259
 he sheltered from the cornice so the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.490
 os x is also home to come back and they 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.810
 also have the south wind pushing them 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.460
 so this is easier for you to 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.310
 to go through there is luc le gall trick 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.039
 it's unlikely Gascon who once 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.550
 cmuc it was the big passage so the 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.080
 great thing 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.550
 Here that was recorded last year 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.560
 and a small passage so actually 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.910
 on October 18th on October 18th this 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.159
 week it's last friday where we have 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.250
 also observed a small peak on a 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:35.009
 shuttle to about 46 million on union 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.880
 so we did not have the big thing but we got 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.880
 still had a passing years 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.760
 years 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.430
 compared to the counting migration we have 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.110
 years when we have no more palates 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.780
 year we have less than last year we have 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.980
 had the record for ten years 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.210
 so we had two million 5,000 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.580
 birds that have gone over these four 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.020
 posts in 2010 but only had nine 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.640
 one hundred and thirty five thousand years ago so here 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.020
 this year we will see 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.390
 I think at the average between 1 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.110
 million 5.1 million 8 on average 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.030
 every year 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.370
 that's with more or less forks 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.420
 important depending on the year but hey 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.420
 will make the plan the end of the season 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.670
 there 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.830
 we 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.300
 later I want to do 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.470
 technician cd so that's why that's it 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.080
 For three years I have come to you are 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.919
 high school of saint pee on level so the 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.600
 high school saint christophe 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.820
 so I am in management bts and 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.919
 nature protection test option 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.110
 management the animations I'm with a 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.310
 federation technician so in fact I 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.770
 help to count today 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.060
 and if not with the jce we make 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.800
 animations for school children by 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.770
 example so for the present time 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.270
 exactly the school how still they 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.889
 have come to count with us on the pass 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.759
 it's really brought communication 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.759
 and publicize the gif 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.729
 and
