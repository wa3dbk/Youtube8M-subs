00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
it's at a good pace that I like we get

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.020 
it's at a good pace that I like we get
lots<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> experience<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.550> do<00:02:31.670> shops

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
lots of experience because we do shops

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
lots of experience because we do shops
and<00:02:32.630> then<00:02:33.110> we've<00:02:33.230> got<00:02:33.380> all<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.650> different

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and then we've got all that different

and then we've got all that different
practical<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.580> theory<00:02:34.850> tests<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:35.510> get<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
practical and theory tests so get like a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.630 
practical and theory tests so get like a
food-safe<00:02:36.380> certificate<00:02:37.070> out<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.280> it

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
food-safe certificate out of it

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.729

that<00:02:39.890> stuff<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.760> didn't<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.720> had<00:02:41.750> anything

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
that stuff I didn't think I had anything

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.080 
that stuff I didn't think I had anything
left<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.800> needed<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.370> learn<00:02:43.520> but<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
left that I needed to learn but I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.680 
left that I needed to learn but I
realized<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.720> had<00:02:44.989> lots<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.770> lots<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.220> me<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.300> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
realized I had lots and lots to me and I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.380 
realized I had lots and lots to me and I
did<00:02:47.930> Luna<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.580> think<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.940> fact<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.209> we

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
did Luna and I think the fact that we

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.990 
did Luna and I think the fact that we
had<00:02:50.540> such<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> brilliant<00:02:51.020> Tudor<00:02:51.709> made<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.850> big

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
had such a brilliant Tudor made the big

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.880 
had such a brilliant Tudor made the big
difference<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:54.200> give<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> hundred<00:02:54.620> percent

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
difference you give a hundred percent

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.680 
difference you give a hundred percent
thing<00:02:55.340> you're<00:02:55.489> going<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:55.910> back<00:02:56.120> 100<00:02:56.570> and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
thing you're going to get back 100 and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.900 
thing you're going to get back 100 and
team<00:02:56.900> four<00:02:57.140> seems<00:02:57.320> easy<00:02:57.700> hopefully<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
team four seems easy hopefully in the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.759 
team four seems easy hopefully in the
future<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.570> course<00:02:59.870> will<00:03:00.080> help<00:03:00.110> would<00:03:00.650> have
