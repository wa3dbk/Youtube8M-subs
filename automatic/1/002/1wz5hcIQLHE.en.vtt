00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hi everyone, everything good 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.520
 today I'll show you some examples of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 how can it be used charming here would be 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.420
 part of the network head but what is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 more usual 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.230
 we see being used in favor as 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 that too, that everything is fine 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 well this is the most usual to show 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
 other applications in the case can be used 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.970
 here the flashlight 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.780
 I made a cable here can be used like this 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.670
 both to hang something and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.090
 has several uses but here it is only for 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.730
 exemplified here was made to the touch by 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.760
 out that in a double that was made 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 the double plow that said run tran 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.920
 it can serve to stop this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 courage to open and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 irregular back here is a handle 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.660
 great is also an application here at 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.670
 sheath of the fishing knife that I put 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.550
 a string in read in the faithful made for 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.980
 rope that was also used a good photo 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.620
 here it was also done that here is a 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.710
 double slide pump also one hand only 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.380
 you will have to pull each other here, but to 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 stick the hand inside that regulates before 13 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.730
 escaping 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.340
 something else that was used here 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.170
 it was a fight and it's also a cable that can 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.690
 be used to tow when you pull 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.520
 a broken car someone so known 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.240
 it a cart when afloat in 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.560
 ravine 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.300
 You have to get the rational out of the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.750
 car can also be done 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.030
 I've tested it. 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.400
 restraint resembling the flashlight 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.580
 The right that I did was also done 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.980
 to the top ten for the rope that can be a 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.250
 Normal race except that instead of the double I 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:56.690
 I used a simple pump made of 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.920
 legal package 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:05.570
 the team only the police cable here or in the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.020
 case where on the boat used a code 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.810
 common here was used in the ICU with polythene strips 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.980
 from inside was made a good pair to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.570
 to be alone there in the same way I did 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.910
 here to learn the little rope that goes to 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.010
 the 20-gallon gallon in the case of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.100
 buoy of the poet I did not use a string 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.870
 I've done it here in uti and here it's the same 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.620
 way you now little either only that 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.700
 compete at a very cool time 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.700
 and here it is 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.100
 where is the poet right and wrong? 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.670
 there to each meter 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:48.430
 I do 115 in a key or the simple 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.140
 each method 3 is sufficient because 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.190
 when you are testing the market it is 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.230
 muddy 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.450
 sometimes it is pumping strong support to it 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.900
 can rebate from the alley in the case of the neighborhood 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.519
 of the flowers what is pulling through 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.580
 You'll realize that it's coming. 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.550
 good 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.640
 It is not speed and I did not hit the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.640
 boat support the nice tip too 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 and another thing I used the tupi arrived 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.910
 is here 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.280
 this is the cast it uses to work the 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.530
 engine counts out of the water 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.690
 so I did here to replace that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.320
 metal clamp has a screw and 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.630
 such 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.580
 this may still be the possibility of 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.850
 risk to motor carriage that was 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.020
 handling then I played here 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.650
 on the other end it 's pretty cool too 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.630
 lastly this is the bicheiro used in the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.180
 piece also did a cable here put 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.160
 a hose at the end and put 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.560
 find the tupi also taken also not 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.570
 cool finish, that 's it folks 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.890
 hopes to have contributed with you 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.530
 knowledge 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.140
 Any questions you ask yourself who 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.140
 Enjoyed the join, thank you.
