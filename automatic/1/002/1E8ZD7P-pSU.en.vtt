00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
with here is the 2008 Honda our six are

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.690 
with here is the 2008 Honda our six are
solid<00:03:19.730> black<00:03:19.820> motor<00:03:20.860> again<00:03:21.860> depending<00:03:22.670> on

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
solid black motor again depending on

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.670 
solid black motor again depending on
what<00:03:22.850> your<00:03:23.060> motor<00:03:23.240> is<00:03:23.330> see<00:03:24.290> how<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.440> got<00:03:24.650> a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
what your motor is see how you got a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.250 
what your motor is see how you got a
solid<00:03:24.950> white<00:03:25.310> wire<00:03:25.610> right<00:03:26.180> right<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:27.050> and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
solid white wire right right there and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.900 
solid white wire right right there and
then<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.470> got<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> blue<00:03:28.250> one<00:03:28.490> with<00:03:28.700> yellow

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
then you got a blue one with yellow

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.930 
then you got a blue one with yellow
tracer<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.410> then<00:03:30.680> down<00:03:30.920> here<00:03:31.310> we<00:03:31.400> got<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.610> black

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
tracer and then down here we got a black

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.010 
tracer and then down here we got a black
wire<00:03:32.740> with<00:03:33.740> a<00:03:33.770> blue<00:03:34.430> tracer<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:35.840> there<00:03:35.990> a

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
wire with a blue tracer so I get there a

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.330 
wire with a blue tracer so I get there a
little<00:03:36.110> bit<00:03:36.230> closer<00:03:36.530> see<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.220> see

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
little bit closer see if you can see

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.990 
little bit closer see if you can see
what<00:03:37.460> I'm<00:03:37.520> talking<00:03:37.790> about

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
what I'm talking about

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.420 
what I'm talking about
we'll<00:03:38.570> be<00:03:38.720> working<00:03:39.080> off<00:03:39.410> those<00:03:39.680> wires<00:03:39.980> so

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
we'll be working off those wires so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.880 
we'll be working off those wires so
basically<00:03:40.880> when<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:41.660> plug<00:03:42.200> in<00:03:42.470> your

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
basically when you plug in your

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.710 
basically when you plug in your
connector<00:03:43.160> off<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.850> stock<00:03:44.090> harness<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.660> you

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
connector off you stock harness that you

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.960 
connector off you stock harness that you
cut<00:03:45.020> off<00:03:45.230> you're<00:03:45.950> going<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.160> wire<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.730> wires

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
cut off you're going to wire the wires

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.630 
cut off you're going to wire the wires
so<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.540> they<00:03:47.720> will<00:03:47.960> splice<00:03:48.410> or<00:03:48.830> connect<00:03:49.280> to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
so that they will splice or connect to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.290 
so that they will splice or connect to
these<00:03:49.850> wires<00:03:50.210> here<00:03:50.690> through<00:03:51.410> your<00:03:51.440> connector

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
these wires here through your connector

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.930 
these wires here through your connector
that<00:03:53.300> way<00:03:53.830> sometimes<00:03:54.830> different<00:03:55.460> connector

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that way sometimes different connector

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.930

to<00:06:33.850> increase<00:06:34.660> voltage<00:06:35.400> if<00:06:36.400> you<00:06:36.639> have<00:06:36.790> any

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
to increase voltage if you have any

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.580 
to increase voltage if you have any
questions<00:06:37.389> on<00:06:37.480> that<00:06:37.510> just<00:06:37.990> give<00:06:38.200> me<00:06:38.290> a<00:06:38.350> call

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
questions on that just give me a call

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.590 
questions on that just give me a call
and<00:06:39.150> then<00:06:40.150> pin<00:06:40.930> number<00:06:41.230> 16<00:06:41.970> this<00:06:42.970> one<00:06:43.300> wire

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
and then pin number 16 this one wire

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.440 
and then pin number 16 this one wire
goes<00:06:44.139> to<00:06:44.470> cam<00:06:44.889> sensor<00:06:45.250> and<00:06:45.639> you<00:06:45.669> crank<00:06:46.150> sensor

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
goes to cam sensor and you crank sensor

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:53.850 
goes to cam sensor and you crank sensor
both<00:06:47.070> so<00:06:48.070> pin<00:06:48.580> number<00:06:48.820> 16<00:06:49.530> 10<00:06:50.530> 11<00:06:51.040> 12<00:06:51.310> 13<00:06:52.470> 14<00:06:53.470> 15

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
both so pin number 16 10 11 12 13 14 15

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.970 
both so pin number 16 10 11 12 13 14 15
16<00:06:54.400> this<00:06:54.850> blue<00:06:55.090> wire<00:06:55.300> right<00:06:55.660> here<00:06:55.720> you<00:06:56.710> have<00:06:56.830> to

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
16 this blue wire right here you have to

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.390 
16 this blue wire right here you have to
splice<00:06:57.310> it<00:06:57.520> off<00:06:57.700> and<00:06:58.150> your<00:06:58.960> cam<00:06:59.230> sensor<00:06:59.620> it's

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
splice it off and your cam sensor it's

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.010 
splice it off and your cam sensor it's
going<00:07:00.639> to<00:07:00.700> be<00:07:00.760> that<00:07:00.940> black<00:07:01.210> wire<00:07:01.510> with<00:07:01.780> a<00:07:01.810> blue

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
going to be that black wire with a blue

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.500 
going to be that black wire with a blue
tracer<00:07:02.530> down<00:07:02.740> showed<00:07:03.040> you<00:07:03.280> and<00:07:03.490> then<00:07:04.240> on<00:07:04.360> the

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
tracer down showed you and then on the

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.510 
tracer down showed you and then on the
crankshaft<00:07:04.840> sensor<00:07:05.320> you<00:07:05.740> got<00:07:05.889> to<00:07:05.979> hook<00:07:06.100> it<00:07:06.310> to

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
crankshaft sensor you got to hook it to

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.460 
crankshaft sensor you got to hook it to
the<00:07:06.639> dark<00:07:06.880> gray<00:07:07.210> wire<00:07:08.010> okay<00:07:09.479> then<00:07:10.479> pin<00:07:10.810> 17

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
the dark gray wire okay then pin 17

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.400 
the dark gray wire okay then pin 17
right<00:07:12.370> next<00:07:12.760> to<00:07:12.940> it<00:07:12.970> is<00:07:13.330> a<00:07:13.360> white<00:07:13.750> wire<00:07:14.050> with<00:07:14.380> a

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
right next to it is a white wire with a

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.690 
right next to it is a white wire with a
red<00:07:14.650> tracer<00:07:15.720> on<00:07:16.720> this<00:07:16.990> one<00:07:17.169> here<00:07:17.560> it<00:07:18.250> goes<00:07:18.490> to

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
red tracer on this one here it goes to

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.430 
red tracer on this one here it goes to
your<00:07:18.820> cam<00:07:19.060> sensor<00:07:19.419> to<00:07:19.690> power<00:07:19.930> up<00:07:20.080> the<00:07:20.169> cam

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 
your cam sensor to power up the cam

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.920 
your cam sensor to power up the cam
sensor<00:07:20.770> you'll<00:07:21.070> go<00:07:21.220> to<00:07:21.280> the<00:07:21.520> blue<00:07:21.729> wire<00:07:21.940> with

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
sensor you'll go to the blue wire with

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.100 
sensor you'll go to the blue wire with
the<00:07:23.080> yellow<00:07:23.110> tracer<00:07:24.630> again<00:07:25.630> we<00:07:25.780> won't<00:07:25.930> worry

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
the yellow tracer again we won't worry

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.879 
the yellow tracer again we won't worry
about<00:07:26.200> 18<00:07:26.800> or<00:07:27.100> 19<00:07:27.580> and<00:07:28.300> 10<00:07:28.630> will<00:07:29.410> go<00:07:29.560> to<00:07:29.620> the

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:29.889 
about 18 or 19 and 10 will go to the

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.460 
about 18 or 19 and 10 will go to the
light<00:07:30.070> gray<00:07:30.370> wire<00:07:30.639> on<00:07:31.060> the<00:07:31.510> crankshaft<00:07:31.990> sensor

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:32.470 
light gray wire on the crankshaft sensor

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.430 
light gray wire on the crankshaft sensor
that<00:07:33.400> be<00:07:33.640> pin<00:07:33.910> 20<00:07:34.419> which<00:07:34.630> be<00:07:34.840> the<00:07:35.020> yellow<00:07:35.140> one

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 
that be pin 20 which be the yellow one

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.140 
that be pin 20 which be the yellow one
here<00:07:35.740> and<00:07:36.310> that's<00:07:37.090> how<00:07:37.450> simple<00:07:37.510> it<00:07:38.110> is
