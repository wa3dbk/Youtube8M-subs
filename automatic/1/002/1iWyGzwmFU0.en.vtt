00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.430
 how is our pony water project going 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.990
 after d 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:18.590
 about six weeks 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.510
 let's see our tilapia crops 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.000
 to see if you can see a little bit the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.000
 size of fingerlings 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.850
 already as a compound food 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.390
 zero diseases 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.700
 only two who have jumped have died 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.560
 that's why we're putting in this 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.560
 mesh so that no longer jump 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.690
 our filter is still processing very well 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 and there is good our plant 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 cucumber where they are already showing 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.770
 first 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.460
 cucumbers are growing 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.000
 has good flower 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 and of the tomatoes in the hr version 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.310
 that show me here are the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.370
 the first and tomatoes 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.770
 they are looking good 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.370
 although I have a problem of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.370
 micronutrients 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.729
 Artichoke 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.110
 and the strawberry the strawberry has not given 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.340
 nothing 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.649
 I do not think anything 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.100
 something is missing I have to follow 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.850
 investigating these the siphons are three 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.060
 tubs are four tubs that we manage 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.200
 go about are about six 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.430
 weeks maybe two months are 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.430
 grabbing a good color 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.619
 of this project that we are 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.619
 experiencing 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.220
 Oh, it looks nice and I start to have a 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220
 good smell 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:27.170
 the next step is to put a little bit of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.170
 earthworms create compost 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.180
 for good to add it to the nutrients of 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.010
 our plants 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.519
 we hope soon and have the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.519
 first fruits
