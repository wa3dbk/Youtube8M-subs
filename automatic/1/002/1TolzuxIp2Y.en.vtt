00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.300
 very important event that is called the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.369
 selection which is a casting type in 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.710
 which any girl without caring 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.660
 which caste is can participate and they are going 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.700
 to take a picture and good of all these 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.200
 girls who participated are going to choose 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 35 which are going to live 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.850
 morally in the palace where they go to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.540
 meet the king to the queens and his son 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.480
 the prince brand 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.150
 and good the prince will meet maxon 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.040
 these 35 girls little by little and the birds 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.410
 eliminating girls are going to see 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.030
 rewarded monetarily because they 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.190
 they are going to give a 7 that they must give to their 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.110
 family then the family of our 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.880
 American protagonist because he is super 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.290
 excited and they want her to participate 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.090
 because they have difficulties 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.650
 economic if they come to be 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.660
 in the selection they would have this 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.100
 money which would help them a lot but 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.140
 america does not want america does not want 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.270
 know nothing of that estate and know anything 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 of dresses of palace things and he what 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.540
 only he wants is to marry this one 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.220
 before continuing I would like 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.320
 tell him that it is important that he 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.570
 remove the prejudice of despite the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.760
 covers that are super cute you think 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.770
 a lot that is exclusive for girls or 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.600
 good for women because these books 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 but it is not like that and anyone can read it 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.650
 and truly enjoy them that are going to 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.120
 like a lot so here by removing 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 the prejudices that this kind of 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.530
 covers are exclusive books for 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.050
 good girls ok we continue in this book 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.209
 you will find romances but they are not roman 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.500
 It is cloying but it is very beautiful and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.780
 very tender and to act is going to do 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.730
 sigh at every moment is very good 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.569
 grounded is not like they fall in love 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.510
 because if 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.400
 5 is the one that I like very much is very 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.260
 fun to watch the selection process 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.510
 how do these girls choose when they arrive 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.129
 to the palace and they all know each other to see 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.840
 girls that are going to be super good and 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.519
 you are going to have to be your best friends 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.379
 and return some others who are not going to 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.450
 fall for nothing right so I'm very 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.189
 very entertaining and very funny to me 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.170
 since I was little I loved everything 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.019
 that has to do with princesses but the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.359
 concept of a nice justice and that 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.189
 have everything not rather the concept of 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.810
 that the councils have to have a 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.579
 mentality different from those of the others 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.840
 girls because they have to govern and 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.239
 they have to make the best decisions 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.459
 for his people that I love I love 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.319
 that power that must have a presence and 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.389
 responsibility in fact one of my 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.400
 favorite movies is the day of the 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.780
 princess that movie is great and 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.219
 I also like very much everyone who 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.810
 they are in the days with the crown 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.939
 english mostly because they are based 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.650
 on real events , for example, come and 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.540
 knows who was also called the queen 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.090
 of vision because he never married and never 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.730
 he had and also the story of the babe 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.010
 victory and had to be reign at age 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.599
 of 18 years nobody believed in her nobody 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.620
 he believed that by his court he will go up 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.360
 govern well and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.400
 is to prove the opposite also by 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.200
 course the story of the sisters ana 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.640
 and Maria Bolena that is fascinating I think 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.989
 that I am already diverting a bit of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.610
 but if they would like me to do a 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.810
 video talking about these things from 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.640
 princesses and queens 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.190
 have me the box so that all of us 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.560
 we complete in princesses or princes not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.840
 you're good we do not have the selection you 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.940
 he owns 5.2 out of 5 that something he wanted 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.860
 comment is that recently revealed 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.840
 that warner bros bought the rights of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.190
 the selection then in the future 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 close let's hope that we are 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.150
 announcing the movie I 'm going to do it 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.190
 super super great and little do not wait 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.289
 that soon two will soon pull out the movie 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.210
 another thing that you want to tell them is that 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.590
 want almost on their official page that they 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.419
 They will leave me a little job if they want 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.490
 visit her said they will do in 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.020
 total five books the first three are 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.940
 of which I am going to talk to you here 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.979
 fourth is the book of the heiress that 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.810
 I have not bought a new event yet 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.479
 I hope to do it soon and the fifth one is going to 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.100
 leaving in 2016 has not yet been 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.350
 revealed what will be the name of this 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.150
 book but if in total there are going to be five 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.010
 apart from these five books there will be 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.350
 another that is going to be as a complement to 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.970
 the saga that they go to the hakim 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.310
 I'm really going to leave you here 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.470
 cover this will come out in October 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.300
 this year and they are several short stories 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.830
 a lot also on the page of vegalarga 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.270
 you can see exactly what they are 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.740
 the stories that are going to come and the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.050
 it looks like it's going to bring some illustrations 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.060
 which is great then we have 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.980
 still a lot of the selection for this 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.930
 year and the one that continues with the 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.030
 reviews we go with the second book that 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.920
 is the guide in balances to know a 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.420
 little more about the history of the country 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.370
 of idea the truth is that it is a book 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.380
 much more exciting in it that has 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.150
 both sunrise as in the first book and 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.070
 there are some parts that are a bit 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.410
 exasperating is so that's why I put him 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.240
 the room with more than five but still 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.280
 it's still a great and good book 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.380
 we go with the third book that is the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.810
 chosen when I started the book that 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.460
 I will enjoy me page by page 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.680
 I was really enjoying it but when 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.810
 get half the book can not 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.940
 letting go of the truth that day was a party 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.520
 there was a baptism and there they have me in the 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.800
 table reading and reading and reading and in the 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.020
 way back I came to my house and from 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.820
 I do not even know that I fell asleep in the 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.800
 early morning but until I finish it 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.600
 I'm not going to sleep because it's super 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.130
 exciting to pass 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.320
 is that you do not wait for anything 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.580
 a lot of real twists this video is 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.710
 incredible because it is the combination 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.540
 perfect between the romance of the 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.640
 selection and the emotion that the 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.710
 book of chose that they combined everything 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.540

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.150
 that has five takes on five and 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.100
 really super super recommended and good 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.290

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.120

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.300
 I always answer them so 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.280
 good many times to stay 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.900
 until this point of the video I see them in 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.560
 the next one we see 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.560
 when suddenly 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:14.850
 and he saw me and person is watching me 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.850
 I know I love you
