on<00:00:00.089> one<00:00:00.690> hand<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:01.290> have<00:00:01.319> our<00:00:01.620> first<00:00:01.829> food<00:00:02.250> wars'

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
on one hand we have our first food wars'

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.630 
on one hand we have our first food wars'
and<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.750> another<00:00:04.049> hand<00:00:04.200> we<00:00:04.710> have<00:00:04.920> boobs<00:00:05.339> that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and on another hand we have boobs that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.110 
and on another hand we have boobs that
defy<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.060> common<00:00:06.660> law<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:07.140> physics<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.400> take

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
defy the common law of physics so take

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.680 
defy the common law of physics so take
your<00:00:09.300> pick

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
your pick

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.450 
your pick
that's<00:00:09.840> what<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.200> episode<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.950> food<00:00:11.130> wars

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
that's what this episode of food wars

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.610 
that's what this episode of food wars
was<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.090> let's<00:00:12.300> get<00:00:12.480> into<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> boob<00:00:13.049> physics

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
was so let's get into the boob physics

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.440 
was so let's get into the boob physics
first<00:00:14.099> because<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.370> think<00:00:14.429> that's<00:00:14.700> all<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.330> we

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
first because I think that's all what we

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.730 
first because I think that's all what we
want<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> get<00:00:15.839> into<00:00:15.990> first

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
want to get into first

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.340 
want to get into first
so<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.279> 30<00:00:20.609> seconds<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.630> know<00:00:21.779> 20

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
so the first 30 seconds you know 20

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.929 
so the first 30 seconds you know 20
seconds<00:00:22.650> 15<00:00:22.890> SEC's<00:00:23.070> whatever<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.850> know

seconds 15 SEC's whatever just you know

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
seconds 15 SEC's whatever just you know
the<00:00:24.060> first<00:00:24.330> segment<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> episode<00:00:25.680> right

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the first segment of the episode right

the first segment of the episode right
before<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> opening<00:00:26.519> song<00:00:28.369> me<00:00:29.369> toes<00:00:30.109> her

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
before the opening song me toes her

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.229 
before the opening song me toes her
breasts<00:00:31.679> manned<00:00:32.070> by<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> common<00:00:32.969> law<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
breasts manned by the common law of

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
breasts manned by the common law of
physics<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.989> did<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> hear<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> sound

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
physics like that did you hear the sound

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.490 
physics like that did you hear the sound
effects<00:00:35.219> sounded<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.750> what<00:00:36.750> fucking<00:00:37.260> meat

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
effects sounded like what fucking meat

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
effects sounded like what fucking meat
slapping<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> counter<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.239> if

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
slapping on the counter like you know if

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970 
slapping on the counter like you know if
you<00:00:39.450> were<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> slap<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> steak<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> counter

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you were to slap a steak on the counter

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.590 
you were to slap a steak on the counter
like<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> grab<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> fucking

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
like if you're just to grab a fucking

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.850 
like if you're just to grab a fucking
steak<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.050> you're<00:00:43.140> wanting<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> cook<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.680> or

steak and you're wanting to cook it or

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
steak and you're wanting to cook it or
liver<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.000> slap<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
liver and you just slap it on the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.119 
liver and you just slap it on the
fucking<00:00:45.899> counter<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> sounded

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
fucking counter that's what it sounded

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.209 
fucking counter that's what it sounded
like<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:48.590> just<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> sound

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
like I'm like just that the sound

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.689 
like I'm like just that the sound
effects<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:52.430> yeah<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> head<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
effects are just yeah so I got a head it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
effects are just yeah so I got a head it
to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.210> studio<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.140> bet<00:00:58.649> they're<00:00:58.800> enjoying

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to the studio I bet they're enjoying

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
to the studio I bet they're enjoying
those<00:00:59.370> sound<00:00:59.670> effects<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.210> meat<00:01:00.690> oh<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.989> think

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
those sound effects on meat oh I think

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
those sound effects on meat oh I think
they<00:01:01.859> definitely<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they definitely are because there was a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
they definitely are because there was a
lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> them<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.040> episode<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
lot of them in this episode and a lot of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
lot of them in this episode and a lot of
the<00:01:06.119> boobs<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.869> straight<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.590> no

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the boobs just going straight up for no

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.530 
the boobs just going straight up for no
apparent<00:01:08.130> reason<00:01:08.549> who's<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.240> straight

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
apparent reason who's going straight

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.460 
apparent reason who's going straight
fucking<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:11.510> like<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> fuck

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
fucking up like what the fuck

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
fucking up like what the fuck
so<00:01:13.680> NATO<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.970> obviously<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.700> used<00:01:17.700> as

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so NATO is obviously going to be used as

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
so NATO is obviously going to be used as
fanservice<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.750> she's<00:01:18.960> gonna<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
fanservice like she's gonna be one of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.719 
fanservice like she's gonna be one of
the<00:01:19.590> main<00:01:19.740> characters<00:01:20.220> throughout<00:01:20.520> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
series that has fanservice going for it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
series that has fanservice going for it
it<00:02:01.079> definitely<00:02:01.439> uses<00:02:01.680> fanservice<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it definitely uses fanservice to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
it definitely uses fanservice to
showcase<00:02:03.030> emotions<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.780> characters<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.320> how

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
showcase emotions of characters of how

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.740 
showcase emotions of characters of how
they<00:02:04.619> feel<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.610> they're<00:02:05.759> eating<00:02:05.969> food<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
they feel when they're eating food and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.840 
they feel when they're eating food and
that's

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
that's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.430 
that's
lightly<00:02:08.240> what<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.660> going<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.350> this

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
lightly what was going on in this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.010 
lightly what was going on in this
episode<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.789> think<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.810> way<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
episode and I think the way the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.230 
episode and I think the way the
fanservice<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.980> used<00:02:13.310> with<00:02:13.610> Mito<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
fanservice is used with Mito as a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.350 
fanservice is used with Mito as a
character<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.290> definitely<00:02:15.830> suits<00:02:16.340> her<00:02:16.910> design

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
character it definitely suits her design

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.210 
character it definitely suits her design
because<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> mean<00:02:18.020> look<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.830> just<00:02:19.040> it's

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
because I mean look it's just it's

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.030 
because I mean look it's just it's
ironic<00:02:19.700> how<00:02:20.140> she's<00:02:21.140> good<00:02:21.380> at<00:02:21.500> cooking<00:02:21.620> meat

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
ironic how she's good at cooking meat

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.280 
ironic how she's good at cooking meat
and<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.940> see<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:23.209> giant<00:02:23.480> meat<00:02:24.050> on

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and then you just see this giant meat on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.320 
and then you just see this giant meat on
her<00:02:24.530> chest<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.160> my<00:02:25.370> god<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
her chest and like my god and just the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.820 
her chest and like my god and just the
meat<00:02:26.510> sound<00:02:26.780> effects<00:02:27.050> too<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.530> sounds

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
meat sound effects too like it sounds

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.850 
meat sound effects too like it sounds
like<00:02:27.920> fucking<00:02:28.100> steak<00:02:28.489> hitting<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.819> counter<00:02:29.180> so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
like fucking steak hitting a counter so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.380 
like fucking steak hitting a counter so
obviously<00:02:30.860> that's<00:02:31.160> what<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.610> animators<00:02:32.239> were

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
obviously that's what the animators were

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.120 
obviously that's what the animators were
going<00:02:32.750> for<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.230> writer<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.830> series

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
going for and the writer of the series

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.100 
going for and the writer of the series
was<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.610> for<00:02:34.790> when<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.569> character<00:02:35.989> was

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
was going for when that character was

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.650 
was going for when that character was
designed<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.950> let's<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.310> roll<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.700> moving

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
designed so let's just roll it moving

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.020 
designed so let's just roll it moving

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
part very predictable in some ways

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.580 
part very predictable in some ways
because<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.450> knew<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:44.989> fact

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
because I knew for a fact

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.830 
because I knew for a fact
so<00:02:46.190> Moe's<00:02:46.400> gonna<00:02:46.610> win<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.090> was<00:02:47.239> very<00:02:47.600> obvious

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
so Moe's gonna win it was very obvious

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.900 
so Moe's gonna win it was very obvious
he<00:02:48.170> was<00:02:48.200> not<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.040> get<00:02:49.220> expelled

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
he was not going to get expelled

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.490 
he was not going to get expelled
like<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.590> doubt<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.130> was<00:02:52.580> pretty<00:02:52.910> much

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
like I doubt that I was pretty much

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.530 
like I doubt that I was pretty much
99.99<00:02:54.500> percent<00:02:54.620> certain<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.880> Mo's<00:02:56.090> going<00:02:56.480> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
99.99 percent certain so Mo's going to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.229 
99.99 percent certain so Mo's going to
pass<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.200> win<00:02:57.470> because<00:02:57.769> he's<00:02:58.760> not<00:02:58.940> going<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
pass and win because he's not going to

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.030 
pass and win because he's not going to
get<00:02:59.360> expelled<00:02:59.660> like<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.080> main<00:03:00.260> objective<00:03:00.920> of

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
get expelled like the main objective of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.710 
get expelled like the main objective of
the<00:03:01.250> series<00:03:01.580> that's<00:03:01.730> been<00:03:01.880> set<00:03:02.180> out<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.510> for

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
the series that's been set out is for

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.280 
the series that's been set out is for
him<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.850> conquer<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.510> know<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.780> elite<00:03:06.049> ten

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
him to conquer you know the elite ten

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.840 
him to conquer you know the elite ten
kind<00:03:06.650> that's<00:03:06.920> kind<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.160> what<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.400> objective

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
kind that's kind of what the objective

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.720 
kind that's kind of what the objective
is<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.209> far<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.470> yeah<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.400> just

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
is so far and so yeah for that I just

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.940 
is so far and so yeah for that I just
really<00:03:11.390> doubted<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.140> he<00:03:12.260> would<00:03:12.470> be<00:03:12.530> expelled

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
really doubted that he would be expelled

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.410 
really doubted that he would be expelled
but<00:03:13.250> later<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.670> down<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.970> road<00:03:14.030> when<00:03:14.390> he

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
but later on down the road when he

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.569 
but later on down the road when he
probably<00:03:15.200> gained<00:03:15.470> some<00:03:15.829> shit<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.100> he<00:03:16.400> gains

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
probably gained some shit like he gains

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.220 
probably gained some shit like he gains
a<00:03:16.760> club<00:03:17.000> room<00:03:17.269> where<00:03:17.480> he<00:03:17.540> gains<00:03:17.780> different

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
a club room where he gains different

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.890 
a club room where he gains different
things<00:03:18.500> then<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.670> up<00:03:19.820> in<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> air<00:03:20.209> if<00:03:20.600> you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
things then it's up in the air if you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.569 
things then it's up in the air if you
will<00:03:21.049> win<00:03:21.260> or<00:03:21.410> lose<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.920> that's<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.400> main

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
will win or lose that that's the main

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.370 
will win or lose that that's the main
thing<00:03:22.760> we<00:03:22.910> have<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.180> warn<00:03:23.390> her<00:03:23.450> because<00:03:23.810> right
