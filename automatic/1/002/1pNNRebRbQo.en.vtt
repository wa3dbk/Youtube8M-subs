00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.020
 how is it possible for the same food 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.950
 be considered carcinogenic by some 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.120
 studies 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.340
 and anticarcinogenic by others that has 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.189
 special soy to be one of the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 most controversial foods that 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.800
 known 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.320
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.079
 The most normal thing is for a food to be 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.079
 considered good or bad with certain 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.510
 unanimity being the majority side that 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.450
 think in a sense and can against 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.240
 minority is pronounced in another 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.300
 however something has soy that has 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.430
 faced many opinions since there are 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 studies that say it's dangerous 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.280
 while others claim that it is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.739
 beneficial to such a point is confusing 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.840
 the information that there is about soy that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 not even the American association 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.780
 against cancer is clear in its 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.630
 positioning 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.239
 but why 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.790
 the logical thing would be to analyze the different 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.780
 studies that there are about soy and 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.700
 analyze advantages and disadvantages but 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.030
 as at this point in life many 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.340
 we already know how things work 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.490
 first thing we will do is see who is 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.759
 behind the studies of this legume 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.470
 Soy is not something new because before 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.110
 that it became fashionable they wore 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.170
 taking it the Asians hundreds of years 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.320
 whether in the form of tofu miso milk 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.260
 sauces this food is consumed 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.680
 massively in Chinese japan and others 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.940
 Eastern countries where it is part of 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.490
 your popular culture 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.100
 while the west has been 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.210
 using until recently as food 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.820
 for cattle but something changed the arrival 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.740
 of transgenic foods made 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.470
 this legume that was one of the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.830
 pioneers in that field will increase 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.410
 exponentially its production over 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.940
 everything in the usa that has become 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.720
 the world's largest producer of soy 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.720
 and it is here where his 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.880
 consumption in the West and was introducing 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.820
 that little by little in different foods 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.210
 being undoubtedly the most popular milk 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.510
 of soybeans at the beginning everything was good 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.930
 and benefits between studies 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.410
 published about soy especially 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.830
 soy milk soy drinks yoghurts 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.590
 of soy juices with soybean soy milk 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.620
 everything was soy 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.260
 and everything was fine until the industry 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.720
 dairyman realized that they were 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.900
 getting into their land so that of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.390
 soon studies began to be financed 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.370
 who talked about the dangers of this 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.440
 legume 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.140
 this leads us to have special 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.480
 caution when analyzing both 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.170
 the studies that speak well as the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 who speak badly about soy, you have to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.330
 clarify that soybean itself the traditional 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.150
 not used for years by the people 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.370
 Asians is a food that should not 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.000
 of missing in our diet especially in 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.329
 women from a certain age soy 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.940
 It is rich in phytoestrogens phytoestrogens 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.859
 that act in a very similar way to 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.549
 the female natural estrogens 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:40.099
 being very useful to regulate the changes 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:44.280
 Hormones is also a positive factor 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.980
 to reduce the theo proxies derived from 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.959
 the lack of estrogen and not only 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.420
 benefits women but the whole 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.870
 of the general population since it is a 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.360
 extraordinary source of proteins 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.310
 some studies have rushed to 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.819
 claim that it is not a complete protein 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.549
 since it lacks some amino acid but if 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.580
 well it is true this is so simple of 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:14.579
 arrange how to accompany the consumption of 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.579
 soybeans with any type of nut 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.320
 also the soy protein endures 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.540
 very extreme temperatures 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.699
 what you cook will not lose part of 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.130
 your proteins another of the 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.370
 characteristics of exquisite soy 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.880
 glycemic ie reduces the amount of 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.669
 blood glucose something that comes to us very 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.910
 good to all but especially to the 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.880
 diabetics 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.030
 Soybeans also reduce both the level of 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.000
 cholesterol like triglycerides and 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.790
 which is low in saturated fats being 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.090
 those containing fat 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.090
 polyunsaturated 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.020
 at a nutritional level it is rich in minerals 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.440
 like iron and calcium and in 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.970
 vitamins the group sees 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.940
 characteristics that make it a 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.180
 good substitute for milk you do not have to 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.700
 forget that the famous soy neighbor is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.330
 as its own name indicates a derivative 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.300
 of this legume but not everything in soy 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.630
 is the color of rose the problem of 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.400
 Soy is not in the plant itself but in 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.380
 their production 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.160
 we have talked about the innumerable 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.900
 benefits of soy we have referred to 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.050
 to the leaves that have been planted during 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.560
 years of traditional way with rotation 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.960
 of crops and of course free of 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.180
 genetic manipulation 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.400
 and that's not the soy that sells us in the 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.819
 west most of the soybeans that 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.150
 we take is of transgenic origin and 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.669
 also in many cases processed with what 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.639
 that we will stay on the road without the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.940
 benefits of soybeans is why 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:03.030
 we must be very attentive to the label 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.150
 and the ingredients of any product 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.599
 made with soybeans either milk oil or 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.789
 derivatives to make sure that no 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:16.259
 comes from genetically grown 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:18.900
 modified and that is in a way the 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:22.190
 soybean as many things in life are 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.479
 good until they start to be misused 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.270
 we leave to finish 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.550
 perhaps the most controversial chapter that 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.250
 is the one that refers to cancer 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.310
 many studies say it prevents the 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.280
 breast cancer and some say what 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.070
 opposite in this case and as we do not know 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.530
 who pays according to what studies there will be 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.320
 look at the countries that usually 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.940
 they take it for years as it could be 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.150
 the case of Japan that by the way has 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.910
 very many fewer cases of breast cancer 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:01.480
 that the west in our next video 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.180
 we will talk about foods that prevent 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.190
 cancer if you do not want to miss that 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.530
 video we encourage you to subscribe 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.530
 here to the reef
