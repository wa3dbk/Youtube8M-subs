 our hotel is such a male 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.090
 scarlet pool but the most valuable here 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.800
 pool is not the most valuable panorama here 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:48.330
 the city which opens from the 11th floor 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.710

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.710
 it's you just 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.970
 hope here 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.380
 since orientation is not very good yet 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.209
 figured out the name of the sagrads in my opinion they are 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.450
 such you will not confuse with anything here 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.450
 in front 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.820

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.100

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.960
 ran 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.000
 top it is useful not to swim 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.600
 worth at least note 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.600
 here is the port 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:29.760
 columbus monument memory of columbus is about 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.760
 and then a third agent 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.020
 there you can see 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.910
 did not know 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.640
 League 1 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.890

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.150
 swim in the pool 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.760
 which is on the eleventh floor 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:54.200
 on the roof of the hotel that we just 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.300
 drove here here there is a special 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.850
 highchair most likely for those people 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.900
 which the sedentary cannot 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.140
 go down the stairs yourself for them 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.480
 there is even a high chair so now they 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.480
 will swim in this pool 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.050
 and went to the restaurant that will direct 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.570
