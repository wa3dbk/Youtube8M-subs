turban thing I did it like this and then

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.539 
turban thing I did it like this and then
the<00:02:52.030> thing<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.510> I'm<00:02:52.720> like<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.620> want<00:02:53.829> to<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.519> my

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
was uncovered so then the thing is these

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.220 
was uncovered so then the thing is these
two<00:03:06.310> went<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.090> well<00:03:07.299> together<00:03:07.540> though<00:03:08.079> I'll

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
two went so well together though I'll

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.059 
two went so well together though I'll
just<00:03:08.440> pair<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.860> up<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.829> first

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
just pair it up like this and the first

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.259 
just pair it up like this and the first
graph<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.360> one<00:03:13.799> I'm<00:03:14.799> sorry<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.579> don't<00:03:16.090> know

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
graph is this one I'm sorry I don't know

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.710 
graph is this one I'm sorry I don't know
the<00:03:16.540> names<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.470> I'll<00:03:17.709> leave<00:03:18.700> all<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.690> links

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the names but I'll leave all the links

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.020 
the names but I'll leave all the links
down<00:03:20.019> below<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.769> it's<00:03:21.190> got<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.579> all<00:03:21.850> these

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
down below and it's got like all these

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.629 
down below and it's got like all these
butterflies<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:23.079> are<00:03:23.139> the<00:03:24.040> yellow<00:03:24.370> green

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.400 
black on this a bit of purple and then
it<00:03:38.650> fades<00:03:39.370> into<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:40.180> blue<00:03:40.720> kind<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.200> thing<00:03:41.380> like

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
it fades into a blue kind of thing like

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.670 
it fades into a blue kind of thing like
so<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.819> then<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.060> next<00:03:43.209> graph<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.900> this<00:03:44.440> one

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
so and then the next graph is this one

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.309 
so and then the next graph is this one
and<00:03:44.709> it's<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.310> orange<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.569> green<00:03:46.810> and

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
like this so it's kind of different and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.789 
like this so it's kind of different and
I<00:03:55.239> like<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.480> fact<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.139> both<00:03:56.440> kind<00:03:56.680> of

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
I like the fact that they both kind of

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.970 
I like the fact that they both kind of

I was going to wear it the other way

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.750 
I was going to wear it the other way
around<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.440> just<00:04:02.470> look<00:04:02.799> really<00:04:03.069> good<00:04:03.250> like

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760
