00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.210
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.740
 I'm going to show you how to make a compass and 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.020
 a map 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.020
 good 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.020
 let's start 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.160
 as you see here it says compass and map or map 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.590
 and compass that same thing 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.270
 for the compass only four are needed 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.540
 iron ingots and a correct sixth 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.220
 neither 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.740
 and for the paper the paper is necessary 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.860
 so that the map of the compass which 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.100
 paper and paper are nine many papers 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.180
 but since they do not come out that way, I have to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.180
 use nine sugar cane 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.980
 and here are the little sugar 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.980
 I use here 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:15.200
 33 for each one 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 there are no papers ready from there are already nine 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.550
 papers that are voting for me 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 and that's what it takes to be the compass 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 I need iron ingot and the rest 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.189
 they are put on the sides 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:42.079
 surroundings in the normal center and the 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.730
 piston in the center and there's the 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.340
 compass 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.340
 and now the map must be done 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.750
 as old 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.050
 See it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.670
 the compass that is to move one side and this 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.020
 it also moves 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 had in hand 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.959
 well now do the map I do not put 38 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.030
 maps 8 papers to be maps and to sorcerer 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.030
 in the center and ready 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.120
 as you will see they say the population 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.120
 now it's going to fill 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.690
 the ego is up 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.950
 and there the map is ready but as 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.790
 He is being filled out no longer killed 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.810
 cold if it does not go further with data 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.550
 you do not realize 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.280
 there there and everything when you want to go 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.060
 only that you have done there 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 enemy map 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.250
 well I hope you liked this video 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.890

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.400
