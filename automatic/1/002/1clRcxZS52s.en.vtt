here's<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> other<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:31.710> too<00:00:31.769> far<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
top of each other that would be one way

about<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.160> Hanging

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
about that I think about the Hanging

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000

what<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> vertical<00:00:44.640> farm<00:00:44.879> might<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.480> my

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
what a vertical farm might look like my

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
what a vertical farm might look like my
goal<00:00:46.500> standard<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> Apple

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
goal standard for this is the Apple

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.459 
goal standard for this is the Apple
