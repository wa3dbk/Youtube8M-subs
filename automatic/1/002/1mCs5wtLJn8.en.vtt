00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
you need to get started this was fairly

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.280 
you need to get started this was fairly
simple<00:04:41.010> but<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.190> know<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:42.570> holstein

group<00:04:43.560> interface<00:04:44.130> can<00:04:44.490> be<00:04:44.520> confusing<00:04:45.090> if

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
group interface can be confusing if

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.390
