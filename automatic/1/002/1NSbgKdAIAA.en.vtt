Achilles heel of the suzuki hayabusa was
always<00:00:30.689> its<00:00:30.810> brakes<00:00:31.430> but<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.910> year

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
always its brakes but now for this year

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.580 
always its brakes but now for this year
you've<00:00:33.600> got<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> additional<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.290> Brembo

you've got the additional of the Brembo
brakes<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> abs<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.870> means<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
brakes and abs it just means that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
brakes and abs it just means that
braking<00:00:37.590> decision<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.190> been<00:00:38.340> taken<00:00:38.700> away<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
braking decision has been taken away and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
braking decision has been taken away and
when<00:00:39.600> you're<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.719> such<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.079> fast<00:00:40.320> bike<00:00:40.590> that's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
when you're on such a fast bike that's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.370 
when you're on such a fast bike that's
what<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.370> need<00:00:41.520> when<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.329> talking<00:00:42.719> 150

margin so what we're going to do today
is<00:00:55.170> basically<00:00:55.680> test<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> brakes<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.969> also

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is basically test the brakes but also

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
is basically test the brakes but also
just<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:57.690> fun<00:00:57.870> we've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.680> an<00:00:58.770> empty

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
just have some fun we've got an empty

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
just have some fun we've got an empty
airfield<00:00:59.460> we've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> plethora<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.600> higher

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
airfield we've got a plethora of higher

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.600 
airfield we've got a plethora of higher
boosters<00:01:01.320> we've<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.860> brand<00:01:02.039> new<00:01:02.160> Bridgestone

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
boosters we've got brand new Bridgestone

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:14.760 
boosters we've got brand new Bridgestone
tires<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.809> we're<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.930> gonna<00:01:04.109> crash

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.110 

one<00:01:15.770> thing<00:01:15.950> about<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.220> high<00:01:16.310> boots<00:01:16.520> always

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
one thing about the high boots always

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.760 
one thing about the high boots always
kept<00:01:17.330> its<00:01:17.510> character<00:01:17.930> really<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:18.410> even<00:01:18.650> this

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
kept its character really so even this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.520 
kept its character really so even this
one<00:01:19.220> it<00:01:19.370> it<00:01:19.640> has<00:01:20.210> much<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.630> same<00:01:20.840> feel<00:01:21.140> as<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
one it it has much the same feel as the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.990 
one it it has much the same feel as the
old<00:01:21.650> one<00:01:21.800> just<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.100> bit<00:01:22.220> more<00:01:22.310> refined<00:01:22.670> really

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
old one just a bit more refined really

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.560 
old one just a bit more refined really
but<00:01:23.980> it's<00:01:24.980> got<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.340> whole<00:01:25.400> balance<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.180> being

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
but it's got that whole balance of being

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.500 
but it's got that whole balance of being
fast<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.230> pretty<00:01:27.440> comfortable<00:01:28.510> handling

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
fast but pretty comfortable handling

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.600 
fast but pretty comfortable handling
pretty<00:01:29.780> well<00:01:29.960> not<00:01:30.440> not<00:01:30.830> as<00:01:30.980> light<00:01:31.130> as<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> sports

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
pretty well not not as light as a sports

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.730 
pretty well not not as light as a sports
paper<00:01:31.880> still<00:01:32.210> pretty<00:01:32.420> light<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.530> think

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
paper still pretty light and I think

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.040 
paper still pretty light and I think
that's<00:01:33.860> why<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:34.430> you've<00:01:34.550> kept<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.840> much

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
that's why so if you've kept it so much

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.480 
that's why so if you've kept it so much
the<00:01:36.260> same<00:01:36.440> because<00:01:36.650> it's<00:01:36.950> got<00:01:37.220> its<00:01:37.340> own<00:01:37.430> little

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the same because it's got its own little

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
the same because it's got its own little
niche<00:01:37.820> really<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:39.050> works

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 

yeah<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.700> Suzuki<00:01:45.299> Hayabusa<00:01:45.420> engine<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
yeah the Suzuki Hayabusa engine is a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.700 
yeah the Suzuki Hayabusa engine is a
perfect<00:01:46.619> fit<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:47.930> it's<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.350> more

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
perfect fit for us it's a much more

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.010 
perfect fit for us it's a much more
robust<00:01:50.610> engine<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> also<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> few<00:01:51.720> genetic

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
robust engine it also got a few genetic

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
robust engine it also got a few genetic
experiments<00:01:52.650> as<00:01:52.740> well<00:01:52.940> obviously<00:01:53.940> being

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
experiments as well obviously being

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
experiments as well obviously being
lightweight<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.200> ideal<00:01:55.650> for<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.070> small

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
lightweight it's ideal for these small

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.850 
lightweight it's ideal for these small
lightweight<00:01:56.729> race<00:01:57.540> cars<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.680> make

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
lightweight race cars and they just make

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.560 
lightweight race cars and they just make
a<00:01:58.890> perfect<00:01:59.369> package<00:01:59.700> really<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.210> whole<00:02:00.330> thing

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
a perfect package really the whole thing

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.050 
a perfect package really the whole thing
is<00:02:00.690> sort<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.900> like<00:02:01.080> married<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:07.550> ice<00:02:08.550> it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
is sort of like married to one ice it's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.400 
is sort of like married to one ice it's
light<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.539> shade<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
light and shade it really as the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
light and shade it really as the
original<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.640> good<00:02:11.790> fight

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
original was it was a really good fight

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
2013 as 2014 model that we're talking

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.030 
2013 as 2014 model that we're talking
about<00:02:20.519> it's<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.320> really<00:02:22.350> composed

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
about it's a really it's really composed

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.540 
about it's a really it's really composed
package<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.570> bike<00:02:24.750> that's<00:02:24.959> very

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
package it's a bike that's very

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.370 
package it's a bike that's very
thoughtful<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:27.150> also<00:02:27.360> talks<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> think

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
thoughtful it also talks to you I think

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.720 
thoughtful it also talks to you I think
if<00:02:28.470> nobody's<00:02:28.920> within<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.220> high<00:02:29.340> booster

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
if nobody's within a high booster

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.220 
if nobody's within a high booster
because<00:02:29.970> if<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> rhythm<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.690> try<00:02:30.930> one

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
because if you have a rhythm one try one

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.900 
because if you have a rhythm one try one
because<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> will<00:02:31.620> surprise<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.370> lot<00:02:32.880> of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
when it hits an over banding and you're

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.860 
when it hits an over banding and you're
talking<00:02:44.370> two<00:02:44.550> speeds<00:02:44.790> 160<00:02:45.390> hundred<00:02:45.630> 70

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
talking two speeds 160 hundred 70

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.970

hundred<00:02:46.110> 90<00:02:46.350> mile<00:02:46.530> an<00:02:46.650> hour<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.920> you're

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
hundred 90 mile an hour and you're

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.590 
hundred 90 mile an hour and you're
hitting<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> over<00:02:47.459> banding<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.360> bikes

hitting the over banding and the bikes

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360 
hitting the over banding and the bikes
just<00:02:48.780> talking<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.829> you<00:02:49.980> know<00:02:50.070> everything

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
just talking to you you know everything

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.770 
just talking to you you know everything
that's<00:02:50.549> happening<00:02:50.940> underneath<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that's happening underneath you and I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.690 
that's happening underneath you and I
think<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.709> people<00:02:53.070> would<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.280> surprised

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
think that people would be surprised

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.340 
think that people would be surprised
when<00:02:53.940> they<00:02:54.030> ride<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> Hayabusa<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.959> feel<00:02:55.140> that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
when they ride a Hayabusa to feel that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.810 
when they ride a Hayabusa to feel that
because<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.100> haven't<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.459> won<00:02:56.549> before

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
because if I haven't really won before

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.100 
because if I haven't really won before
they<00:02:56.940> might<00:02:57.120> think<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.329> it's<00:02:57.540> long<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.810> it's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
they might think that it's long and it's

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
they might think that it's long and it's
violent<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.680> all<00:02:58.739> about<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.100> power<00:02:59.310> but<00:02:59.910> this

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
violent for all about the power but this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.420 
violent for all about the power but this
is<00:03:00.150> much<00:03:00.360> more<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.810> motorcycle<00:03:01.650> than<00:03:02.070> you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
is much more of a motorcycle than you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.770 
is much more of a motorcycle than you
might<00:03:02.640> think<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.090> you'd<00:03:03.209> only<00:03:03.390> seen<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
might think if you'd only seen the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.090 
might think if you'd only seen the
hybrids<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.170> think<00:03:04.350> it's<00:03:04.470> all<00:03:04.650> about<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
hybrids and think it's all about the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.500 
hybrids and think it's all about the
engine<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.910> with<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> new<00:03:06.239> braking

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
engine this one with a new braking

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.970 
engine this one with a new braking
system<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> new<00:03:07.380> braking<00:03:07.590> system

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
system I like the new braking system

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.090 
system I like the new braking system
very<00:03:08.130> much<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.549> brakes<00:03:08.760> are<00:03:09.290> instant<00:03:10.290> they're

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
very much the brakes are instant they're

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.819 
very much the brakes are instant they're
great<00:03:11.400> feedback<00:03:11.760> very<00:03:12.510> strong<00:03:12.989> just<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:13.739> you

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
great feedback very strong just what you

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.530 
great feedback very strong just what you
need<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> bike<00:03:14.400> ride<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.700> high<00:03:15.060> booster<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
need on a bike ride the high booster and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.979 
need on a bike ride the high booster and
this<00:03:16.470> deserves<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.459> as<00:03:17.640> popular<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.570> as

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
this deserves to be as popular and as

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.449 
this deserves to be as popular and as
successful<00:03:19.590> as<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.739> hybrid<00:03:20.070> has<00:03:20.100> been
