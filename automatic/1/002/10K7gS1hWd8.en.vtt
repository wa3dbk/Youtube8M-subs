 dreams but Tom is very father ever 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.960
 in this camp of the penta side we are going to 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.780
 use a little bit of butter 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.390

 beef broth and surf 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 then what I'm going to do 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.710
 to put good because it is already very 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 hot 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.130

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:36.040
 ok one comes out the endives are a kind 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.880
 of lettuce that is given inside the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.030
 jail of evín went away very appreciated 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.009
 when the wine started to have its boom and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.750
 now you can find them 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.430
 already of cultivation that we can already 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.210
 find all year and everywhere 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.100
 of the world it is a bitter lettuce 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 that to my very particular point of view 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 It tastes very good with this recipe 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.790
 ok then well let's put 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.080
 this combines a face with a little face 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.150
 noble chamo do not like the little face and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.040
 this is how rich 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.050
 well let's put this little bit 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.000
 butter now I did it like that because 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.410
 You know, it's already very hot and I do it 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.750
 the other way around, what will happen is that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.390
 I'm going to burn the butter I 'm going to 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.980
 put a little butter on top of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.900
 my envy 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.010
 and this is obviously going to add 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.909
 very much and we are going to put them 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.860
 love to come back to be very rich 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.349
 come you can also make this recipe 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.450
 in the oven and how is the procedure 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.579
 put everything in a refractory and put it 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.140
 to the other and leave there they are doing 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.810
 little girls and they are very 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.510
 tasty good we're not going to put 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.780
 I'll even take my clothespins 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.189
 little birds to fly ok 4 see the pints and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 I'm going to turn my envy 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:01.240
 start the butter to release its flavor 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.590
 and now I'm going to add 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.390
 soy, lemon juice, beef broth 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.390
 I'm going to take it out of the fire 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.930
 and I'll let this consume slow 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.930
 slowly 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.090
 to fire very low we are going to put a 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.520
 little sugar because Libya as 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.300
 it is bitter 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.890
 the sugar lowers a little the flavor 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.520
 bitter of things then it gets 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.440
 sugar instead of those and we put a 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.850
 little bit of sugar and what's going to happen 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.460
 now we are going to cover them 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.430
 to start cooking 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.890
 so round of our vintage is 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.800
 will put on medium heat 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.840
 and the time you leave time 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.540
 they resist touring 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 they turn and you can put their 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.330
 salsita what you crave 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.510
 It could also be with balsamic vinegar 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:05.220
 it could also be with some port 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.380
 it can be with this one because it's already tendered 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.050
 with solita can be for now that 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.730
 we throw the rolls this one can 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.090
 do as you want to give that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:21.109
 special touch on and with the agave 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.620
 rich is to be rich I like it and good and 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.690
 he told them that there are people who do not 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.430
 like to eat this part of here if 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.870
 they want to remove the only have to 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.420
 make him 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.180
 Check the 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.180
 here still versions of the good 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.090
 they only make a cut in 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.060
 triangular 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.610
 but do not cut it anymore there's not much 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.650
 who does not like to eat it 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.530
 then you can remove this part is 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.879
 I heart this I do like me 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.490
 leave it because it's the part that has more 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.150
 fiber of the whole endive and then the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.150
 they start walking 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.570
