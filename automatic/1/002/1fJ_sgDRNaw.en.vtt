00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.929
 finally a reasonable multitouch 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.339
 monitor at the height of time so me 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.540
 I'm really excited 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.280
 and there he stands before me the lg 23 et 83 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.350
 and I want to unpack it right away 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.130
 and look what is not in it unfortunately 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.920
 hdmi cable usb vga cable driver cd and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 The power supply is small and compact 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.530
 but it is an external power supply what 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 the wiring a bit 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.890
 makes it so impractical then I build that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 ding times on here with me im 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.679
 recording studio and yes quickly fix 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.929
 it's a fate, after all 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.230
 what the lg of course with many others 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.789
 touch monitors share the stand power 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.129
 Although a very stable impression leaves 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.760
 But only in one axis forward 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.420
 and back and not at the same time 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.550
 very far 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 so I can show that better 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.729
 I put the monitor on one here 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.070
 turntable so you can see 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.009
 can be more than 45 degrees after 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 behind are not in it 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.790
 on the connection side we have two hdmi 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.040
 ports a usb port for the touch 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.289
 functionality an analog vga and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 a headphone jack 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.850
 since the monitor does not mount to usa 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.399
 standard, I can unfortunately mean 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.100
 Ergotron swivel not for assembly 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.310
 use and am on the stand like that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 as he is instructed so I sometimes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 Sounds the power adapter then look 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.460
 we looks sometimes like the screen 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.240
 hdmi cable in and equal juice 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 on it look what the club impression 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.210
 schwuppdiwupp makes her picture is already 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 there it is already very nice 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 I start a video file that I 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.399
 well know 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.710
 just a first 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.590
 to have impression of the colors and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.600
 the presentation quality 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.609
 I cut the video myself 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.670
 So I know very well and know how 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.929
 he must be able to look right now 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.580
 to compare the very peek 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.930
 color neutral because it filmed here 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.040
 monitorbild but still too 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.959
 comparison 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.299
 in the original actually only a bit 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.769
 more red otherwise that looks very good 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.569
 Out of the presentation quality is too 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.790
 really very much at lateral top view 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.639
 very good the colors slip at all 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.159
 not visible away then it comes as 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.290
 over ips panels usual to an abrupt 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.760
 brightness loss but the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.340
 perspective I would say 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.480
 is very good if you have a look 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.909
 Reflections like the detail 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.799
 Setting the on screen displays 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.629
 Unfortunately, you can only reach that via the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.060
 in the beginning of the menu and over its 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.579
 fourth point so so for 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.799
 this menu now just look 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.169
 five targeted finger tips of the 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.750
 really not very readable touch 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.519
 buttons are required 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.409
 if you are there you will find everything on 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.849
 place as you wish 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.680
 and also very detailed of the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.590
 Allround monitor so that you can very well 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.819
 Life 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.129
 yes it is so far now I want that 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.379
 monitor of course finally as a touch 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.090
 Try the monitor and connect it 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.060
 I'll use it for the first time via usb 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.329
 calculator and uses the opportunity 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.549
 to insert the installation cd and 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.919
 as the lg has imagined 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.030
 setup by panting 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.829
 the monitor masters all common 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.239
 progressive and leaves behind 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.209
 presentation format and 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.079
 frame rates reached 48 heart 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.329
 however not after the first adapt 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.400
 the tablet pc system settings go 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.709
 actually go directly I have here 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.560
 a mixer surface of an audio 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.030
 project from me called and try 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.540
 Just hang around like this 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.540
 feels 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.840
 yes my screen fields react 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.820
 so wonderful as well as the buttons 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.640
 Here I have to practice a bit for 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.420
 you have to touch the right-click 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.680
 hold it a bit longer 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.200
 As you can see, there are also small buttons 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.730
 no problem if you count well 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.030
 only the hand position at the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.590
 maximum passion is on permanent 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.070
 exhausting yes here I have one more 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 a bit practice loud and quiet that it only 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.340
 the drums 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.640
 yes here is another example of the curves 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.050
 based equalizer is really suitable 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.690
 in principle very good for the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.430
 touch-control I have to stop one 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.330
 practice a bit because of course they are 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.580
 points designed for mouse operation and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.660
 so a little touch but with 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.200
 a bit of exercise is always better 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:07.440
 and then it's really fun ton 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.440
 Production with smartphone comfort 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.840
 Windows 8 supports it too 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.500
 finally every 10 points 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:23.590
 Here's a quick run through a finger 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:27.010
 drawing with the paint app otherwise 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.830
 the system also recognizes gestures like the 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.130
 typical zwick gesture to get out and in 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.930
 You can thankfully turn on zooming 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.320
 Demonstration object is then always 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.310
 the maps app with which you look through the 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.310
 planets can root 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.980
 the problem with the ergonomics of 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.780
 stand I have for me now 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.870
 first solved so that the monitor 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.750
 here in the studio upside down on a stool 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.260
 have laid so that the stand now 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.170
 As a music stand , one must of course 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.890
 then in windows from windows 7 is the 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:07.970
 easily this monitor in the 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.980
 mirror horizontally and then served 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.560
 none of this is very nice 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.710
 permanent solution but for the first one 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.960
 useful variant so I hope they 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.840
 was fun and was one 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.980
 revealing test video all the best 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.980
 see you soon again
