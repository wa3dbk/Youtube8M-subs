to the ward you need to in secure it so

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.640 
to the ward you need to in secure it so
like<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.889> shoe<00:04:58.669> repairer<00:04:59.060> uses<00:04:59.660> the<00:05:00.289> pizzas

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
like a shoe repairer uses the pizzas

so<00:05:07.099> what<00:05:07.639> I've<00:05:07.729> done<00:05:07.789> is<00:05:08.740> talk<00:05:09.740> some<00:05:09.949> cordage<00:05:10.400> I

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020

this log and then organized twist it

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.010 
this log and then organized twist it

over on itself driven axe made the nexel

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.350 
over on itself driven axe made the nexel

my<00:05:33.050> fault<00:05:33.409> it<00:05:34.250> holds<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.729> piece<00:05:34.909> of<00:05:34.940> wood

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
my fault it holds the piece of wood

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.749 
my fault it holds the piece of wood
insecure<00:05:35.979> so<00:05:36.979> you<00:05:37.340> don't<00:05:37.520> want<00:05:37.669> your

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.959 
footsteps put you on the floor you have
it<00:05:39.710> so<00:05:40.009> there's<00:05:40.340> a<00:05:40.460> little<00:05:40.610> bit<00:05:40.789> of<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:43.669> space

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
it so there's a little bit of the space

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.459
