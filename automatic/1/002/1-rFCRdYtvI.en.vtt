00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
quarters most of these challenges are

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.900 
quarters most of these challenges are
pretty<00:00:17.699> easy<00:00:18.529> but<00:00:19.529> they'll<00:00:20.250> take<00:00:20.460> some<00:00:20.520> time

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
pretty easy but they'll take some time

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.009 
pretty easy but they'll take some time
and<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:23.310> goal<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.910> getting<00:00:24.180> these<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.779> just

and the goal of getting these is to just

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.990 
and the goal of getting these is to just
be<00:00:25.830> determined<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> need<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> play<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
be determined and you need to play the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.439 
be determined and you need to play the
right<00:00:27.150> game<00:00:27.359> mode<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.590> let's<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.429> started

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
right game mode so let's get started

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.990 
right game mode so let's get started
the<00:00:31.109> aughh<00:00:31.349> a3<00:00:32.130> um<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:34.309> received<00:00:35.309> by<00:00:35.520> getting<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the aughh a3 um is received by getting a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.410 
the aughh a3 um is received by getting a
10<00:00:36.480> squad<00:00:36.840> revives<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.700> 30<00:00:38.700> assault<00:00:39.120> rifle

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
10 squad revives and 30 assault rifle

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.930 
10 squad revives and 30 assault rifle
kills<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> easier<00:00:41.670> ones

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
kills now this is one of the easier ones

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
kills now this is one of the easier ones
but<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.870> annoying<00:00:43.110> sometimes

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but can kind of be annoying sometimes

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.690 
but can kind of be annoying sometimes
because<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> squad

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
because you have to get the squad

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.410 
because you have to get the squad
revives<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.800> what<00:00:46.800> I'd<00:00:46.890> suggest<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.579> joining<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
revives so what I'd suggest is joining a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.080 
revives so what I'd suggest is joining a
squad<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.260> full<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.969> make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
squad that is full or you know to make

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.630 
squad that is full or you know to make
it<00:00:51.149> full<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> three<00:00:52.410> people<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it full if it is three people and to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.740 
it full if it is three people and to
just<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.719> run<00:00:54.930> around<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
just like run around with them and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
just like run around with them and
revive<00:00:57.750> them<00:00:57.930> whenever<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.399> if

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
revive them whenever they go down now if

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
revive them whenever they go down now if
you're<00:01:00.270> doing<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.539> without<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> Mike<00:01:01.109> it's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
your squad keeps running like if you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.300 
your squad keeps running like if you
throw<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> down<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.659> maybe<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.310> resupply

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
throw it down you maybe get one resupply

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
throw it down you maybe get one resupply
but<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> run<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.810> them

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
but then you have to run back to them

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
but then you have to run back to them
and<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:44.040> gets<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.520> frantic<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.090> if

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and it gets a little bit frantic but if

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.770 
and it gets a little bit frantic but if
what<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> suggest<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
what I suggest is to just like a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.560 
what I suggest is to just like a
go<00:01:49.410> down<00:01:49.590> next<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.980> sniper<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.330> put

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
go down next to a sniper and then put

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.150 
go down next to a sniper and then put
down<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:51.930> ammo<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.530> every<00:01:52.680> single<00:01:52.920> time<00:01:53.040> you

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
down some ammo and every single time you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.670 
down some ammo and every single time you
reload<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> squad<00:01:54.030> resupply<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.690> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

this<00:04:20.299> took<00:04:20.480> me<00:04:20.630> about<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.840> week<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.350> do<00:04:21.500> because

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
this took me about a week to do because

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.570 
this took me about a week to do because
the<00:04:23.570> hand<00:04:23.780> grenades<00:04:24.080> don't<00:04:24.470> always<00:04:24.620> kill<00:04:24.920> so

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the hand grenades don't always kill so

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.040 
the hand grenades don't always kill so
you<00:04:25.610> really<00:04:25.880> need<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.060> get<00:04:26.210> lucky<00:04:26.420> or<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.810> need

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
you really need to get lucky or you need

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.380 
you really need to get lucky or you need
to<00:04:27.110> go<00:04:27.230> like<00:04:27.410> find<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.890> sniper<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.550> then<00:04:28.940> when

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
to go like find a sniper and then when

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.360 
to go like find a sniper and then when
you'd<00:04:29.720> normally<00:04:29.930> knife<00:04:30.380> him<00:04:30.590> just<00:04:31.160> throw<00:04:31.310> a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
you'd normally knife him just throw a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.030 
you'd normally knife him just throw a
grenade<00:04:31.640> up<00:04:31.820> his<00:04:31.970> butt<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.330> then<00:04:33.020> it'll<00:04:33.800> kill

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
grenade up his butt and then it'll kill

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.220 
grenade up his butt and then it'll kill
him<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:35.650> actually<00:04:36.650> just<00:04:37.010> got<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:38.020> gun<00:04:39.020> today

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
I have it on just so that battlefields

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.780 
I have it on just so that battlefields
more<00:04:52.130> fun<00:04:53.290> but<00:04:54.290> you<00:04:54.680> need<00:04:54.800> 10<00:04:55.010> kills<00:04:55.250> with<00:04:55.370> c4

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
more fun but you need 10 kills with c4

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.330 
more fun but you need 10 kills with c4
um<00:04:56.540> this<00:04:56.870> one<00:04:57.020> this<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.290> pretty<00:04:57.590> easy<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:58.310> just

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
um this one this is pretty easy you just

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.210 
um this one this is pretty easy you just
like<00:04:58.730> set<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.180> around<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.660> flag<00:04:59.930> in<00:05:00.620> domination

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
like set it around a flag in domination

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.210 
like set it around a flag in domination
or<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:02.110> parachute<00:05:03.110> over<00:05:03.260> now<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.740> our<00:05:03.770> canals

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
or you parachute over now so our canals

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.940 
or you parachute over now so our canals
and<00:05:04.460> throw<00:05:04.610> down<00:05:04.760> some<00:05:04.910> c4<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.600> you'll<00:05:06.590> get<00:05:06.740> it

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
and throw down some c4 and you'll get it

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.280 
and throw down some c4 and you'll get it
probably<00:05:07.520> within<00:05:07.790> one<00:05:07.940> or<00:05:08.030> two<00:05:08.090> games<00:05:08.360> 10

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
probably within one or two games 10

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.130 
probably within one or two games 10
knife<00:05:09.500> takedowns<00:05:10.070> this<00:05:10.910> one's<00:05:11.150> also<00:05:11.720> pretty

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
knife takedowns this one's also pretty

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.249 
knife takedowns this one's also pretty
easy<00:05:12.230> go<00:05:13.220> up<00:05:13.340> behind<00:05:13.580> an<00:05:13.760> enemy<00:05:13.880> knife<00:05:14.270> um

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
easy go up behind an enemy knife um

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.490 
easy go up behind an enemy knife um
moving<00:05:16.889> on<00:05:17.009> to<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.460> mtar<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.689> one<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.169> also

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
moving on to the mtar this one is also

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.339 
moving on to the mtar this one is also
pretty<00:05:19.680> tough<00:05:20.599> it<00:05:21.599> takes<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:22.020> long<00:05:22.319> time

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
pretty tough it takes a long time

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.959 
pretty tough it takes a long time
because<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:23.099> need<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.310> get<00:05:23.430> hundred<00:05:23.729> kills

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
because you need to get hundred kills

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.029 
because you need to get hundred kills
with<00:05:24.120> carbines<00:05:24.449> this<00:05:25.259> will<00:05:25.439> probably<00:05:25.620> this

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
with carbines this will probably this

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.450 
with carbines this will probably this
took<00:05:26.280> me<00:05:26.460> about<00:05:26.729> I<00:05:27.449> think<00:05:28.319> two<00:05:28.680> games<00:05:28.979> only

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
took me about I think two games only

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.339 
took me about I think two games only
because<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:29.819> got<00:05:30.030> like<00:05:30.150> 70<00:05:30.629> kills<00:05:30.840> on<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.050> first

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
because I got like 70 kills on the first

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.059 
because I got like 70 kills on the first
one<00:05:31.560> which<00:05:32.370> was<00:05:32.550> pretty<00:05:32.849> lucky<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:34.560> then

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
one which was pretty lucky and then

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.570 
one which was pretty lucky and then
getting<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:35.610> kill<00:05:35.819> an<00:05:35.969> EOD<00:05:36.240> bot<00:05:36.449> now<00:05:37.580> you'll

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
getting a kill an EOD bot now you'll

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.860 
getting a kill an EOD bot now you'll
probably<00:05:38.819> end<00:05:39.090> up<00:05:39.210> boosting<00:05:39.659> for<00:05:39.780> this

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
probably end up boosting for this

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.189 
probably end up boosting for this
because<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.139> get<00:05:40.229> frustrated<00:05:40.500> but<00:05:41.539> they<00:05:42.539> your

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
because you get frustrated but they your

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.990 
because you get frustrated but they your
d<00:05:43.349> bot<00:05:43.590> actually<00:05:44.009> kills<00:05:44.219> pretty<00:05:44.520> fast<00:05:44.759> when

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
d bot actually kills pretty fast when

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.510 
d bot actually kills pretty fast when
you<00:05:45.060> burn<00:05:45.240> someone<00:05:45.659> so<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:46.949> just<00:05:47.099> find<00:05:47.370> a

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
you burn someone so you just find a

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.939 
you burn someone so you just find a
person<00:05:47.849> who's<00:05:47.969> camping<00:05:48.419> on<00:05:48.629> the<00:05:49.319> crane<00:05:49.590> and

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
person who's camping on the crane and

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.529 
person who's camping on the crane and
nos<00:05:50.129> are<00:05:50.370> Canales<00:05:50.789> or<00:05:50.909> you<00:05:51.000> go<00:05:51.120> up<00:05:51.150> behind<00:05:51.419> a

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
nos are Canales or you go up behind a

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.899 
nos are Canales or you go up behind a
sniper<00:05:51.870> that's<00:05:52.199> a<00:05:52.500> on<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.800> rock<00:05:53.580> or<00:05:53.849> something

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
sniper that's a on a rock or something

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.510 
sniper that's a on a rock or something
and<00:05:54.419> you<00:05:54.840> burn<00:05:55.050> them<00:05:55.289> just<00:05:55.919> make<00:05:56.069> sure<00:05:56.219> not<00:05:56.490> to

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
and you burn them just make sure not to

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.610 
and you burn them just make sure not to
ram<00:05:56.939> into<00:05:57.180> them<00:05:57.389> with<00:05:57.599> it<00:05:57.719> and<00:05:57.870> make<00:05:58.319> sure<00:05:58.349> it

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
ram into them with it and make sure it

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.540 
ram into them with it and make sure it
says<00:05:58.800> like<00:05:59.449> Zod<00:06:00.449> bot<00:06:00.719> we're<00:06:01.710> in<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:02.069> kill<00:06:02.279> feed

says like Zod bot we're in the kill feed

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.339 
says like Zod bot we're in the kill feed
otherwise<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.449> won't<00:06:03.569> get<00:06:03.750> if<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:04.020> just<00:06:04.199> says

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
otherwise you won't get if it just says

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.350 
otherwise you won't get if it just says

it's<00:06:20.039> just<00:06:20.729> as<00:06:20.849> good<00:06:20.879> as<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.210> m98b<00:06:21.919> but<00:06:22.919> people

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
it's just as good as the m98b but people

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.839 
it's just as good as the m98b but people
have<00:06:23.849> their<00:06:24.000> preferences<00:06:24.479> and<00:06:24.839> I<00:06:24.930> like<00:06:25.139> both

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
have their preferences and I like both

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.550 
have their preferences and I like both
50<00:06:26.849> kills<00:06:27.029> of<00:06:27.120> sniper<00:06:27.360> rifles<00:06:27.779> I<00:06:27.990> get<00:06:28.169> just<00:06:28.440> use

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
50 kills of sniper rifles I get just use

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.200 
50 kills of sniper rifles I get just use
the<00:06:28.680> m98b<00:06:29.159> you'll<00:06:29.639> get<00:06:29.759> it<00:06:29.849> really<00:06:29.969> quickly

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
the m98b you'll get it really quickly

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.240 
the m98b you'll get it really quickly
when<00:06:30.810> three<00:06:31.110> rounds<00:06:31.409> of<00:06:31.469> conquest<00:06:31.949> domination

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
when three rounds of conquest domination

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.999 
when three rounds of conquest domination
this<00:06:33.060> gets<00:06:33.389> pretty<00:06:33.629> tough<00:06:34.020> because<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:34.860> need

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009 
this gets pretty tough because you need

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:36.800 
this gets pretty tough because you need
to<00:06:35.069> have<00:06:35.190> a<00:06:35.219> good<00:06:35.430> team<00:06:35.669> and<00:06:36.000> you<00:06:36.449> can't<00:06:36.659> like

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
to have a good team and you can't like

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.119 
to have a good team and you can't like
join<00:06:37.110> a<00:06:37.139> game<00:06:37.379> where<00:06:37.589> you're<00:06:37.710> getting

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
join a game where you're getting

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.050 
join a game where you're getting
destroyed<00:06:38.569> so<00:06:40.250> my<00:06:41.250> suggestion<00:06:41.729> would<00:06:41.940> be<00:06:42.000> to

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
destroyed so my suggestion would be to

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.149 
destroyed so my suggestion would be to
join<00:06:42.449> a<00:06:42.479> lobby<00:06:42.810> that<00:06:42.990> isn't<00:06:43.500> false<00:06:43.770> you<00:06:44.009> can

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
join a lobby that isn't false you can

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.700 
join a lobby that isn't false you can
switch<00:06:44.490> teams<00:06:44.819> if<00:06:45.180> one<00:06:45.900> of<00:06:45.990> your<00:06:46.080> teams<00:06:46.289> is<00:06:46.529> if

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
switch teams if one of your teams is if

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.820 
switch teams if one of your teams is if
like<00:06:47.069> the<00:06:47.189> team<00:06:47.370> you<00:06:47.460> join<00:06:47.639> is<00:06:47.789> getting<00:06:48.000> killed

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
like the team you join is getting killed

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.909 
like the team you join is getting killed
and<00:06:50.509> lastly<00:06:51.509> but<00:06:51.839> definitely<00:06:52.289> not<00:06:52.379> least<00:06:52.439> is

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
and lastly but definitely not least is

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.490 
and lastly but definitely not least is
the<00:06:54.469> m5k<00:06:55.469> um<00:06:56.009> this<00:06:56.250> is<00:06:56.400> probably<00:06:56.699> the<00:06:56.819> one<00:06:56.939> most

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
the m5k um this is probably the one most

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.709 
the m5k um this is probably the one most
funnest<00:06:58.500> wants<00:06:58.830> to<00:06:58.919> do<00:06:59.150> you<00:07:00.150> need<00:07:00.270> to<00:07:00.330> get<00:07:00.419> 100

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:00.719 
funnest wants to do you need to get 100

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.709 
funnest wants to do you need to get 100
kills<00:07:00.870> or<00:07:00.990> submachine<00:07:01.409> guns<00:07:01.680> so<00:07:02.719> basically

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:03.719 
kills or submachine guns so basically

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:05.749 
kills or submachine guns so basically
what<00:07:03.930> it's<00:07:04.080> saying<00:07:04.229> is<00:07:04.469> get<00:07:04.979> a<00:07:05.039> service<00:07:05.490> start

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
what it's saying is get a service start

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.459 
what it's saying is get a service start
with<00:07:05.939> like<00:07:06.089> one<00:07:06.330> gun<00:07:06.539> though<00:07:07.050> that's<00:07:07.259> the<00:07:07.349> way

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:07.469 
with like one gun though that's the way

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.959 
with like one gun though that's the way
I<00:07:07.500> thought<00:07:07.800> about<00:07:07.979> it<00:07:08.189> so<00:07:08.339> I<00:07:08.370> just<00:07:08.610> took<00:07:08.759> like

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
I thought about it so I just took like

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.700 
I thought about it so I just took like
at<00:07:09.120> my<00:07:09.300> um<00:07:09.419> 45<00:07:09.930> and<00:07:10.289> I<00:07:11.389> got<00:07:12.389> a<00:07:12.419> service<00:07:13.379> start

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
at my um 45 and I got a service start

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.589 
at my um 45 and I got a service start

while doing this

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.619 
while doing this
