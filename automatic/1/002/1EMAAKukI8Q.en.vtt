00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 nvidia geforce gtx 980ti oh 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.080
 in the early spring of 2015 the company nvidia 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.240
 pleased all her fans 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 the announcement of the new flagship video card 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
 nvidia geforce gtx titan x she is now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
 holds a leading position in the market in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.949
 performance plan and worth order 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.119
 thousand dollars is quite logical that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.890
 nvidia decided not to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 dwell on successes 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 use the flagship processor in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.430
 somewhat stripped down version it is about 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 new nvidia geforce gtx graphics card 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.309

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.590
 take a look at the comparison chart 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.969
 video memory as claimed by nvidia novelty 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 provides a significant increase

 achieved at 4k ultra hd resolution 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.860
 which is rapidly gaining 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.990
 popularity among wealthy gamers 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.909
 also looks impressive by comparison 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770

 maximum power noise level at 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.750
 This was a subjective sensation. 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.370
 low and quite comfortable in mode 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.350
 maximum speed of the blade 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.540
 fan temperature dp lowered 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.700
 up to 71 degrees with quite a noise 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.780
 logically rose above the average and 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.670
 stopped being comfortable for 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.170
 long work near while at 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.430
 no load frequency works 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.500
 graphics core and memory automatically 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.630
 the temperature drops in this mode 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.549
 gets you not to exceed 49 degrees 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.260
 since the fan and generally ceased 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.540
 handle and cooling system worked 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.830
 completely passive mode as a whole cooler 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.170
 the test model manifested itself 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.920
 only on the positive side 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.810
 showing not only high 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.100
 cooling efficiency but also comfortable

 talk about performance als oysters 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.210
 gtx 980ti oh very simple since she 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.100
 is the undisputed leader in our 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.290
 comparing her competition I can make

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.320
 it turned out faster nvidia geforce gtx 980 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.120
 an average of 25 percent if not 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.180
 take into account the 4k ultra mode 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.130
 easy to lag gtx 980 reduced to 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.810
 22 percent as we see new 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.310
 demonstrates the greatest excellence 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.410
 at high resolutions which is not surprising 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.060
 considering the memory bus width 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.450
 video memory size and total and 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.760
 computing power is 970 and gtx780 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.560
 also expected to be behind in 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.530
 an average of 33 and 42 percent 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.660
 gtx 980 accordingly 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.460
 lagging decreases to 37 and 39 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.450
 percent accordingly if not 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.180
 take into account the results 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.390
 4k ultra hd test mode 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.160
 and m d radeon r9 290x ceded novelties in

 an average of 36 percent if the 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.970
 consider only full hd mode then 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.010
 this indicator is reduced to 34 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.470
 percent in total performance times 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.240
 oysters leave with a 980ti a and is on 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.920
 very high level and and will 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.480
 enough for any modern games on

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.750
 disperse the same period 1286 megahertz with 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.380
 considering the work of technology nvidia gi pi 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.970
 Yugus 20 its purity averaged 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.760
 1387 megahertz video memory while

 able to accelerate up to 8072 megahertz 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.880
 ultimately we managed to achieve in 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.820
 average increment frame rate 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.170
 at the level of 5.8 percent which is 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.880
 very good result 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.350
 since the novelty has an already very 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.350
 high level of factory overclocking 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.530
 graphics card asus 30s 980ti oh can 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.360
 feel free to call an excellent choice for 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.710
 secured gamers wanting to collect 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.350
 imagine a system for comfortable gaming

 process in 4k ultra hd resolution 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.950
 also perfect for overclockers 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.870
 to achieve new heights in art 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.740
 overclocking updates guarantee excellent 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.180
 performance 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.160
 It is best suited for multi-screen 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.570
 their high resolution configurations 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.310
 the only feature concerns 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.840
 relatively large system dimensions 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.640
 cooling in the end this video card 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.470
 definitely deserves your attention 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.820
 especially if you are not limited to 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.170
 funds to buy really
