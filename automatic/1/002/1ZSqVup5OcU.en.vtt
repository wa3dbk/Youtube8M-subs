little<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.609> straight<00:03:39.879> from<00:03:40.030> Gary<00:03:40.329> Hooper

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
little is straight from Gary Hooper

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.080 
little is straight from Gary Hooper
right<00:03:41.379> in<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> far<00:03:41.889> side<00:03:42.099> think<00:03:42.819> he<00:03:42.910> got<00:03:43.060> a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
right in the far side think he got a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.030 
right in the far side think he got a
little<00:03:43.150> deflection<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.139> way<00:03:44.319> off<00:03:44.980> a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
little deflection on the way off a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.949 
little deflection on the way off a
defender<00:03:46.470> because<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:48.669> generated<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.329> pretty

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
defender because it generated a pretty

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.559 
defender because it generated a pretty
decent<00:03:50.349> amount<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.680> curve<00:03:51.129> one<00:03:52.090> side<00:03:52.299> hit<00:03:52.449> it

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
decent amount of curve one side hit it

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.119 
decent amount of curve one side hit it
with<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.750> left<00:03:53.019> foot<00:03:53.230> think<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:53.980> that

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
with the left foot think is it that

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.339 
with the left foot think is it that
defender<00:03:54.519> right<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:54.879> front<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.449> when<00:03:56.109> in<00:03:56.260> the

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
defender right in front and when in the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.750 
defender right in front and when in the
far<00:03:56.560> corner<00:03:56.590> she<00:03:57.010> went<00:03:57.160> on<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.280> win<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.609> game

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760
