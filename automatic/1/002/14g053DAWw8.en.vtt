let's<00:01:41.530> say<00:01:41.679> that<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.009> wanted<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> actually<00:01:42.579> go

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
let's say that you wanted to actually go

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.160 
let's say that you wanted to actually go
through<00:01:42.909> every<00:01:43.299> one<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.570> these<00:01:43.689> windows<00:01:44.020> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
through every one of these windows and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.990 
through every one of these windows and
see<00:01:44.289> what<00:01:44.439> they<00:01:44.560> are<00:01:44.590> clearly<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.729> this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
see what they are clearly in this

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.940 
see what they are clearly in this
example<00:01:46.270> they're<00:01:46.509> all<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.719> same<00:01:46.750> but<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.829> you

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
example they're all the same but if you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.050 
example they're all the same but if you
had<00:01:48.039> different<00:01:48.280> windows's<00:01:48.520> would<00:01:48.789> actually

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
had different windows's would actually

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.359 
had different windows's would actually
be<00:01:49.149> useful<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:50.319> cycle<00:01:50.829> through<00:01:50.859> them<00:01:51.039> all<00:01:51.159> you

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
be useful to cycle through them all you

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.959 
be useful to cycle through them all you
can<00:01:51.490> press<00:01:51.670> command<00:01:52.030> tilde<00:01:53.640> watch<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.819> go

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
can press command tilde watch it go

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.880 
can press command tilde watch it go
going<00:01:55.899> through<00:01:56.049> all<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.350> windows<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.649> then

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
going through all the windows and then

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
if you press command shift tilde you go

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.639 
if you press command shift tilde you go
the<00:02:00.939> other<00:02:01.119> direction<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.959> then<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.500> see
