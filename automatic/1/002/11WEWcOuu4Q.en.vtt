been<00:00:16.109> able<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.379> use<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:17.690> benchmade<00:00:18.690> adamas

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
been able to use this benchmade adamas

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.800 
been able to use this benchmade adamas
275<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.220> whole<00:00:20.490> lot<00:00:20.609> more<00:00:20.880> than<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.570> before

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
275 a whole lot more than I had before

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
275 a whole lot more than I had before
and<00:00:23.810> it's<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.869> hard<00:00:25.080> use<00:00:25.289> folder<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.130> it's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and it's a hard use folder so it's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.170 
and it's a hard use folder so it's
sturdier

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
sturdier

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
sturdier
it's<00:00:27.480> made<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.840> d2<00:00:28.529> steel<00:00:28.800> actually<00:00:29.519> I'm

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it's made with d2 steel actually I'm

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.859 
it's made with d2 steel actually I'm
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> come<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
looks like so you see this plain edge

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
looks like so you see this plain edge
here<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.530> coated<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.430> seracote<00:00:42.149> so

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
here and it is coated in seracote so

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 
here and it is coated in seracote so
it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> nice<00:00:42.840> hearty<00:00:43.260> durable<00:00:44.040> coating<00:00:44.190> it's

it's a nice hearty durable coating it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.680 
it's a nice hearty durable coating it's
a<00:00:44.640> cyber<00:00:44.940> blade<00:00:45.440> he's<00:00:46.440> known<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.680> his<00:00:47.690> like

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a cyber blade he's known for his like

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.639 
a cyber blade he's known for his like
clean<00:00:49.230> hard<00:00:50.129> use<00:00:50.579> looking<00:00:51.030> blades<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
clean hard use looking blades this is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.299 
clean hard use looking blades this is
definitely<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.989> grip<00:00:55.920> panels

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
definitely one of them the grip panels

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.869 
definitely one of them the grip panels
are<00:00:56.489> g10<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.750> liners<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.379> 410<00:00:58.800> steel<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
are g10 the liners are 410 steel and it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.260 
are g10 the liners are 410 steel and it
has<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> deep<00:01:00.510> pocket<00:01:01.079> clip<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.730> access

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
has a deep pocket clip and the access

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.240 
has a deep pocket clip and the access
locking<00:01:03.690> mechanism<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.680> thing<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
locking mechanism the thing about this

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.480 
locking mechanism the thing about this
is<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.950> believe<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.280> talk

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
is it is actually I believe when I talk

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330 
is it is actually I believe when I talk
to<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> representatives<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> ski

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to the representatives if it is the ski

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.030 
to the representatives if it is the ski
strongest<00:01:12.180> access<00:01:12.750> lock<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.860> one

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
strongest access lock they have on one

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.920 
strongest access lock they have on one
of<00:01:14.070> their<00:01:14.280> folders<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:15.509> least<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> time

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
of their folders at least for the time

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530 
of their folders at least for the time
being

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.720 

and<00:01:20.540> now<00:01:21.440> because<00:01:21.890> I've<00:01:22.040> been<00:01:22.130> using<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.580> so

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
and now because I've been using it so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.400 
and now because I've been using it so
much<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.000> figured<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.570> great<00:01:23.840> time<00:01:24.110> for

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
much I figured this is a great time for

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.160 
much I figured this is a great time for
for<00:01:25.010> some<00:01:25.190> review<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.810> stuff<00:01:26.990> that

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
for some review on it the stuff that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.280 
for some review on it the stuff that
I've<00:01:27.290> been<00:01:27.320> cutting<00:01:27.650> with<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.980> mostly<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.460> a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
I've been cutting with it mostly is a

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.090 
I've been cutting with it mostly is a
brush<00:01:30.310> branches<00:01:32.410> chipping<00:01:33.410> off<00:01:33.530> bark<00:01:33.860> for

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
brush branches chipping off bark for

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.660 
brush branches chipping off bark for
kindling<00:01:34.520> stuff<00:01:34.820> like<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:36.370> because<00:01:37.370> it<00:01:37.520> is

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
kindling stuff like that because it is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.270 
kindling stuff like that because it is
made<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.660> be<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:39.050> hard<00:01:39.350> use<00:01:39.560> folder<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.100> not

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
made to be a hard use folder it's not

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.570 
made to be a hard use folder it's not
designed<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.180> be<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.450> really<00:01:41.810> sharp<00:01:42.130> fine<00:01:43.130> razor

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
designed to be a really sharp fine razor

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.969 
designed to be a really sharp fine razor
edge<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:46.490> because<00:01:47.330> it's<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.720> d2<00:01:48.260> tool<00:01:48.680> steel

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
edge but because it's that d2 tool steel

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.130 
edge but because it's that d2 tool steel
it's<00:01:49.310> really<00:01:49.640> Hardy<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.150> it<00:01:50.240> lasts<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.990> edge

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
it's really Hardy and it lasts the edge

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.109 
it's really Hardy and it lasts the edge
that<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.500> takes<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.920> lasts<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.369> while<00:01:52.490> doesn't

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
that it takes it lasts a while doesn't

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.940 
that it takes it lasts a while doesn't
mean<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.509> takes<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.780> long<00:01:53.840> time<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.259> to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
mean that it takes a long time to to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.999 
mean that it takes a long time to to
sharpen<00:01:55.400> them<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.470> I'm<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:57.590> going<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.860> take

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
sharpen them so I'm just going to take

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.130 
sharpen them so I'm just going to take
this<00:01:58.100> piece<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.430> paper<00:01:58.580> here<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.119> show<00:02:00.080> you

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
this piece of paper here and show you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.590 
this piece of paper here and show you
what<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.440> edge<00:02:00.560> is<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.950> before<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.119> go<00:02:02.479> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
what the edge is like before I go and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.020 
what the edge is like before I go and
hack<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.080> branch<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.710> showed<00:02:03.830> you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.300 

so<00:02:08.030> cuts<00:02:08.300> pretty<00:02:08.479> clean

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.360 

and<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:14.170> I'm<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.500> use<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.100> see<00:02:15.250> how

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and now I'm going to use it and see how

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.790 
and now I'm going to use it and see how
well<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.580> holds<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:17.230> first<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.590> need<00:02:17.770> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
well that holds up but first I need to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.380 
well that holds up but first I need to
change<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.280> angle<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.670> cameras<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.270> can

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
change the angle the cameras as you can

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:50.059 
change the angle the cameras as you can
see

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.280 

I<00:02:50.159> wouldn't<00:02:50.939> recommend<00:02:51.060> using<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.870> benchmade

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
I wouldn't recommend using the benchmade

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.349 
I wouldn't recommend using the benchmade
for<00:02:52.439> a<00:02:52.469> boat<00:02:52.590> awning<00:02:52.920> because<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.430> blade<00:02:54.329> is

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
for a boat awning because the blade is

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.989 
for a boat awning because the blade is
less<00:02:54.719> than<00:02:54.900> four<00:02:55.139> inches<00:02:55.469> long<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.069> even

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:56.999 
less than four inches long and even

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.759 
less than four inches long and even
though<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.269> weighty<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:57.870> seven<00:02:58.290> point<00:02:58.560> six

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
though it's weighty it's seven point six

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.059 
though it's weighty it's seven point six
eight<00:02:58.980> ounces<00:02:59.340> it's<00:03:00.239> not<00:03:00.540> really<00:03:01.469> heavy<00:03:01.709> as<00:03:01.889> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
eight ounces it's not really heavy as to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.640 
eight ounces it's not really heavy as to
give<00:03:02.219> you<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> whole<00:03:02.639> lot<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.849> momentum<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
give you a whole lot of momentum for a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.280 
give you a whole lot of momentum for a
chopping<00:03:05.189> cut<00:03:05.370> action<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:06.030> an<00:03:06.180> axe<00:03:06.389> this<00:03:07.109> is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
chopping cut action like an axe this is

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.369 
chopping cut action like an axe this is
just<00:03:07.469> kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:08.239> little<00:03:09.239> bit<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.719> test<00:03:10.049> just

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
just kind of a little bit of a test just

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.470 
just kind of a little bit of a test just
to<00:03:10.469> see<00:03:10.560> how<00:03:10.829> well<00:03:11.010> or<00:03:11.700> what<00:03:11.909> this<00:03:12.090> kind<00:03:12.389> of

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
to see how well or what this kind of

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:28.179 
to see how well or what this kind of
Steel<00:03:12.719> and<00:03:12.959> edge<00:03:13.290> does<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.519> branch<00:03:14.819> here

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.640 

has<00:03:29.189> been<00:03:29.430> nice<00:03:29.639> though<00:03:29.879> with<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.650> using

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
has been nice though with this is using

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.530 
has been nice though with this is using
it<00:03:31.859> for<00:03:31.889> cutting<00:03:32.340> up<00:03:32.430> kindling<00:03:32.939> especially

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
it for cutting up kindling especially

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.479 
it for cutting up kindling especially
and<00:03:33.659> clearing<00:03:33.989> out<00:03:34.109> some<00:03:34.260> smaller<00:03:35.010> branches

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and clearing out some smaller branches

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.990 
and clearing out some smaller branches
as<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.359> see<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.280> put<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.549> pretty<00:03:38.790> solid

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
as you can see here I put a pretty solid

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.300 
as you can see here I put a pretty solid
hurtin<00:03:39.419> on<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:40.739> branch<00:03:42.349> and<00:03:43.349> now<00:03:44.099> I'm<00:03:44.159> going

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
hurtin on this branch and now I'm going

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.559 
hurtin on this branch and now I'm going
to<00:03:44.370> take<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.669> same<00:03:44.819> piece<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.150> paper<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.419> had

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
to take that same piece of paper I had

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.240 
to take that same piece of paper I had
before<00:03:46.969> and<00:03:47.969> do<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.359> same<00:03:48.540> cut<00:03:48.750> test<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.290> see

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
before and do the same cut test and see

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.199 
before and do the same cut test and see
how<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.579> edge<00:03:50.760> was<00:03:50.969> maintained

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:04.220 

so<00:03:57.209> again<00:03:58.220> clean<00:03:59.220> cut<00:03:59.489> clean<00:03:59.819> edge<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:03.230> so

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
so again clean cut clean edge here so

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.839 
so again clean cut clean edge here so
even<00:04:04.500> though<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.860> not<00:04:04.980> designed<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.610> be<00:04:05.730> a

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
even though it's not designed to be a

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.240 
even though it's not designed to be a
super<00:04:06.180> fine<00:04:06.420> cutter<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.989> does<00:04:07.230> hang<00:04:07.890> on<00:04:08.069> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
super fine cutter it does hang on to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.240 
super fine cutter it does hang on to
that<00:04:08.370> edge<00:04:08.580> for<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> good<00:04:09.150> long<00:04:09.300> time<00:04:10.069> I'm<00:04:11.069> going

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
that edge for a good long time I'm going

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:37.480 
that edge for a good long time I'm going
to<00:04:11.340> zoom<00:04:11.459> back<00:04:11.489> out

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.780 

I<00:04:37.520> got<00:04:38.210> this

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
I got this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:51.350 
I got this
[Music]

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.360 

so<00:04:51.659> 275<00:04:52.560> here

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.270 

the<00:04:55.970> 275<00:04:56.720> here<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.320> don't<00:04:57.830> know<00:04:58.010> if<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.160> can

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
the 275 here I don't know if you can

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.250 
the 275 here I don't know if you can
tell<00:04:58.490> by<00:04:58.669> my<00:04:58.850> hand<00:04:59.090> size<00:04:59.300> it's<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.660> pretty<00:04:59.870> thick

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
tell by my hand size it's a pretty thick

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.310 
tell by my hand size it's a pretty thick
blade<00:05:00.590> it's<00:05:01.580> very<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.540> feels<00:05:02.930> like<00:05:03.139> it's

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
blade it's very it feels like it's

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.810 
blade it's very it feels like it's
really<00:05:03.530> solid<00:05:03.830> construction<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.699> it

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
really solid construction and it

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.510 
really solid construction and it
definitely<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.870> it's<00:05:06.199> held<00:05:06.560> up<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.040> abuse

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
definitely is it's held up to the abuse

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.909 
definitely is it's held up to the abuse
I<00:05:07.639> put<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:07.970> through<00:05:08.290> but<00:05:09.290> because<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:09.770> is

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
I put it through but because it is

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.219 
I put it through but because it is
thicker<00:05:10.460> it's<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.180> little<00:05:11.419> harder<00:05:11.720> for<00:05:11.750> me<00:05:11.960> to

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
thicker it's a little harder for me to

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.980 
thicker it's a little harder for me to
conceal<00:05:12.979> it<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:13.460> not<00:05:13.639> impossible<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.510> just

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
conceal it it's not impossible I just

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.270 
conceal it it's not impossible I just
kind<00:05:15.139> of<00:05:15.169> have<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.320> think<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.710> little<00:05:15.800> bit<00:05:15.949> more

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
kind of have to think a little bit more

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.250 
kind of have to think a little bit more
about<00:05:16.460> what<00:05:16.699> I'm<00:05:16.820> wearing<00:05:17.090> beforehand<00:05:17.630> for
