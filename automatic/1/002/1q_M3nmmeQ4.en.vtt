basically<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.900> i'm<00:01:48.960> using<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.320> ions

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
basically what i'm using for ions

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.719 
basically what i'm using for ions
nothing<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.290> special<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.220> basic

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
nothing really special it's very basic

slam<00:06:58.460> and<00:06:58.729> revenge<00:06:59.979> alright<00:07:00.979> so<00:07:01.130> let's<00:07:01.340> try

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
slam and revenge alright so let's try

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.230 
slam and revenge alright so let's try
this<00:07:02.720> particular<00:07:03.250> pull<00:07:04.250> this<00:07:04.880> is<00:07:05.000> going<00:07:05.120> to<00:07:05.180> be

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
this particular pull this is going to be

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.110 
this particular pull this is going to be
a<00:07:05.270> little<00:07:05.419> interesting<00:07:09.220> to<00:07:10.220> devastate<00:07:10.699> go<00:07:11.060> to

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
a little interesting to devastate go to

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.629 
a little interesting to devastate go to
the<00:07:11.349> initial<00:07:12.349> elite<00:07:12.800> because<00:07:13.159> if<00:07:13.280> he<00:07:13.430> gets

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
the initial elite because if he gets

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.249 
the initial elite because if he gets
loose<00:07:13.849> he'll<00:07:14.120> do<00:07:14.240> a<00:07:14.270> lot<00:07:14.599> more<00:07:14.630> significant

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 
loose he'll do a lot more significant

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:16.749 
loose he'll do a lot more significant
damage<00:07:15.590> than<00:07:15.860> the<00:07:15.949> rest<00:07:16.099> of<00:07:16.159> the<00:07:16.280> non<00:07:16.460> elites

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
damage than the rest of the non elites

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.760 
damage than the rest of the non elites
so<00:07:17.479> he's<00:07:17.690> a<00:07:17.720> bigger<00:07:17.960> priority<00:07:18.229> in<00:07:18.650> this

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
so he's a bigger priority in this

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.909 
so he's a bigger priority in this
particular<00:07:19.370> case<00:07:19.759> and<00:07:20.440> they<00:07:21.440> went<00:07:21.620> down<00:07:21.740> no
