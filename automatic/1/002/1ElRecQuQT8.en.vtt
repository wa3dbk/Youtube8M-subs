has a nice blue paint job to it so yeah
we<00:00:38.960> have<00:00:39.080> kind<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.620> center<00:00:40.580> area<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:40.970> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
we have kind of the center area of the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.860 
we have kind of the center area of the
under<00:00:41.989> area<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:43.129> ship<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.790> I<00:00:44.000> think<00:00:44.360> not

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
under area of the ship but I think not

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.460 
under area of the ship but I think not
adding<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.040> planes<00:00:46.519> and<00:00:46.730> all<00:00:46.850> that<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.470> to

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
adding the planes and all that to the to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.890 
adding the planes and all that to the to
the<00:00:48.589> deck<00:00:48.820> really<00:00:49.820> made<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.449> ship<00:00:50.659> look

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
the deck really made the ship look

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.020 
the deck really made the ship look
better<00:00:51.110> that's<00:00:51.680> what<00:00:51.830> I<00:00:51.920> believe<00:00:52.159> and<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:52.909> see

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
better that's what I believe and you see

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.460 
better that's what I believe and you see
the<00:00:53.150> guns<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:53.479> all<00:00:53.540> that<00:00:53.720> we'll<00:00:54.140> check<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
the guns and all that we'll check the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.649 
the guns and all that we'll check the
bottom<00:00:54.799> area<00:00:55.010> out<00:00:55.100> here<00:00:55.369> before<00:00:55.580> but<00:00:56.390> they<00:00:56.570> do

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
bottom area out here before but they do

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:57.850 
bottom area out here before but they do
have<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.839> control<00:00:57.140> center<00:00:57.320> which<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.650> can<00:00:57.739> see

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
have a control center which you can see

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.649 
have a control center which you can see
from<00:00:57.890> there<00:00:58.220> and<00:00:58.729> then<00:00:59.150> just<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.479> whole

deck would come down and we'll just go
through<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.679> then<00:01:37.189> we're<00:01:37.280> gonna<00:01:37.369> go

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
through this and then we're gonna go

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.429 
through this and then we're gonna go
downstairs<00:01:37.670> upwards<00:01:38.570> check<00:01:38.840> out<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.079> engine

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
downstairs upwards check out the engine

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.649 
downstairs upwards check out the engine
room<00:01:39.829> or<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.549> quarters<00:01:43.270> stripes<00:01:44.270> oh<00:01:44.479> yeah

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
room or the quarters stripes oh yeah

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.120 
room or the quarters stripes oh yeah
this<00:01:44.869> would<00:01:45.020> be<00:01:45.049> where<00:01:45.560> they<00:01:45.710> come<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.009> get

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
this would be where they come to get

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.510 
this would be where they come to get
briefed<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.520> mission<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:49.189> would<00:01:49.399> be

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
briefed on the mission this would be

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.219 
briefed on the mission this would be
like<00:01:49.700> their<00:01:49.880> weapon<00:01:50.450> checks<00:01:50.780> or<00:01:50.899> something

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
like their weapon checks or something

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.249 
like their weapon checks or something
more<00:01:52.189> ships<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.060> then<00:01:53.630> we<00:01:53.719> head<00:01:53.869> towards<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
more ships and then we head towards the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.620 
more ships and then we head towards the
front<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.689> well<00:01:56.689> I<00:01:56.960> guess<00:01:57.289> that's<00:01:57.619> okay<00:01:58.630> so

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
front so well I guess that's okay so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.929 
front so well I guess that's okay so
then<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.990> would<00:02:00.139> be<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:01.539> I'm<00:02:03.819> asked<00:02:04.819> how<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
then this would be the I'm asked how the

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.749 
then this would be the I'm asked how the
hell<00:02:05.149> do<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.569> I<00:02:06.399> don't<00:02:07.399> know<00:02:07.549> what

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
hell do you see that I don't know what

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.510 
hell do you see that I don't know what
this<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> living

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
this is so this is like the living

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.460 
this is so this is like the living
quarters<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.970> guess<00:02:11.120> or<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.390> chill<00:02:11.750> room<00:02:11.959> about

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
quarters I guess or the chill room about

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.699 
quarters I guess or the chill room about
the<00:02:12.650> children<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.280> lounge<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:15.590> is

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
the children the lounge this is

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.290 
the children the lounge this is
definitely<00:02:16.160> not<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.640> front<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.120> ship

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
definitely not the front of the ship

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.870 
definitely not the front of the ship
because<00:02:17.450> our<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.080> control<00:02:18.590> room<00:02:18.770> cos<00:02:19.010> you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
because our the control room cos you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.729 
because our the control room cos you
can't<00:02:20.120> see<00:02:20.360> anything<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:23.510> guess<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.200> is

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.540 

yeah<00:02:28.739> let's<00:02:29.010> head<00:02:29.190> back<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:32.190> under

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
yeah let's head back to the under

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.979 
yeah let's head back to the under
carriage<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.870> ship<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.489> we'll<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.840> what

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
carriage of the ship and we'll see what

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:37.490 
carriage of the ship and we'll see what
we<00:02:37.110> see

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
we see

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.790 
we see
let's<00:02:38.220> turn<00:02:38.340> fly<00:02:38.610> off<00:02:38.959> I'll<00:02:39.959> guess<00:02:40.080> why<00:02:40.379> I<00:02:40.410> was

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
let's turn fly off I'll guess why I was

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.710 
let's turn fly off I'll guess why I was
long<00:02:40.920> before<00:02:41.040> an<00:02:41.220> L<00:02:41.310> turn<00:02:41.489> off<00:02:41.610> okay<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.540> let's

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
long before an L turn off okay so let's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.089 
long before an L turn off okay so let's
go<00:02:42.840> under<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.379> see<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> living<00:02:43.830> quarters

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
go under and you see the living quarters

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.070 
go under and you see the living quarters
so<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.519> have<00:02:44.610> these<00:02:44.730> small<00:02:45.180> rooms<00:02:45.450> you'll

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
so we have these small rooms you'll

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.869 
so we have these small rooms you'll
never<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.830> eight<00:02:47.129> people<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> room

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
never have like eight people in a room

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.690 
never have like eight people in a room
because<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.569> wrong<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:50.069> let's<00:02:50.250> try<00:02:50.549> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
because this is wrong but let's try and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.789 
because this is wrong but let's try and
find<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:53.390> let's<00:02:54.390> try<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.720> find<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.319> captains

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
find the let's try and find the captains

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:56.530 
find the let's try and find the captains
quarters

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
quarters

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.479 
quarters
that's<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.930> bathroom<00:02:58.079> okay<00:02:58.530> let's<00:02:59.340> try<00:02:59.430> to

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
that's the bathroom okay let's try to

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.740 
that's the bathroom okay let's try to
find<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.760> captain's<00:03:00.090> quarters<00:03:00.299> which<00:03:00.599> would

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
find the captain's quarters which would

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.650 
find the captain's quarters which would
be<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.220> best-looking<00:03:02.220> room<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.060> probably

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
be the best-looking room and probably

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.699 
be the best-looking room and probably
with<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> sound<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:06.110> don't<00:03:07.110> know<00:03:07.200> what<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.440> says

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
with a sound I don't know what that says

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.580 
with a sound I don't know what that says
I<00:03:07.950> think<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.310> German<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.260> guess<00:03:13.470> this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
I think it's in German so I guess this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.960 
I think it's in German so I guess this
is<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:14.190> pop<00:03:15.060> Pop's<00:03:15.299> room<00:03:15.540> which<00:03:16.470> leads<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
is a pop Pop's room which leads to the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.680 
is a pop Pop's room which leads to the
engine<00:03:18.299> room

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
engine room

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.110 
engine room
maybe<00:03:19.670> this<00:03:20.670> probably<00:03:21.000> engine<00:03:21.269> room<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:23.120> it's

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
looks like the engine room I'm gonna say

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.390

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.620 

that<00:04:02.880> works<00:04:03.060> uh<00:04:06.200> maybe<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:08.299> it<00:04:09.299> it's

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
that works uh maybe this is it it's

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.599 
that works uh maybe this is it it's
really<00:04:09.780> complicated<00:04:10.109> it's<00:04:10.440> all<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.769> German<00:04:11.489> so

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
really complicated it's all in German so

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.979 
really complicated it's all in German so
I<00:04:11.639> can't<00:04:11.849> understand<00:04:12.209> what<00:04:12.299> he's<00:04:12.419> saying<00:04:12.690> or

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
I can't understand what he's saying or

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.219 
I can't understand what he's saying or
at<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.650> sign<00:04:13.829> say<00:04:14.069> but<00:04:14.940> yeah<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.630> could<00:04:16.079> be

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
at the sign say but yeah this could be

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.210 
at the sign say but yeah this could be
the<00:04:16.320> engine<00:04:16.530> room<00:04:16.709> -<00:04:16.889> maybe<00:04:17.630> then<00:04:18.799> this<00:04:19.799> would

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
the engine room - maybe then this would

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.360 
the engine room - maybe then this would
go<00:04:21.229> me<00:04:22.229> yeah<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.470> think<00:04:22.590> maybe<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.130> engine

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
go me yeah I think maybe this the engine

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.890 
go me yeah I think maybe this the engine
room

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
room

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.150 
room
I'm<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.110> sure<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.289> really<00:04:25.620> don't<00:04:25.889> know<00:04:26.010> guys

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160

I'm sorry but if we head down we get to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.930 
I'm sorry but if we head down we get to
the<00:04:30.840> hull<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.200> ship<00:04:31.289> which<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.310> here<00:04:32.789> and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
the hull of the ship which is here and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:42.110 
the hull of the ship which is here and
then<00:04:33.060> go<00:04:33.570> down<00:04:33.750> more<00:04:34.110> we<00:04:34.890> get<00:04:35.099> to<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.690> water

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.779 

yeah<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.419> think<00:04:43.750> you're<00:04:43.870> watching<00:04:47.789> okay

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
yeah she is very well done I think it

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:53.850 
yeah she is very well done I think it
looks<00:04:52.660> quite<00:04:52.990> detailed<00:04:53.470> compared<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.800> the
