00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.910 
at this end and then a crease up here
where<00:02:37.120> our<00:02:37.150> tails<00:02:37.540> are<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.620> we're<00:02:38.830> going

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.830 
your long end of your ribbon again
you're<00:04:37.460> gonna<00:04:37.550> find<00:04:37.850> your<00:04:38.000> next<00:04:38.210> crease<00:04:38.540> which

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
you're gonna find your next crease which

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.440 
you're gonna find your next crease which
is<00:04:39.020> right<00:04:39.230> here<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:40.820> time<00:04:41.120> we're<00:04:41.390> gonna

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
is right here and this time we're gonna

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.290 
is right here and this time we're gonna
you're<00:04:42.020> gonna<00:04:42.080> fold<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:43.280> way<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.580> then

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
you're gonna fold it this way and then

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.230 
you're gonna fold it this way and then
you're<00:04:44.450> gonna<00:04:44.540> tuck<00:04:45.170> this<00:04:45.680> crease<00:04:46.160> up<00:04:46.580> into

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
you're gonna tuck this crease up into

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.850 
you're gonna tuck this crease up into
the<00:04:47.360> middle<00:04:47.570> so<00:04:47.870> it's<00:04:48.020> not<00:04:48.140> gonna<00:04:48.320> go<00:04:48.410> on<00:04:48.530> top

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
the middle so it's not gonna go on top

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.450 
the middle so it's not gonna go on top
it's<00:04:49.160> gonna<00:04:49.340> go<00:04:49.520> under<00:04:49.910> this<00:04:50.480> first<00:04:50.810> layer<00:04:51.460> so

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
it's gonna go under this first layer so

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.070 
it's gonna go under this first layer so
then<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.790> just<00:04:52.820> goes<00:04:53.180> you're<00:04:53.420> right<00:04:53.600> in<00:04:53.810> there

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
then it just goes you're right in there

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.330 
then it just goes you're right in there
like<00:04:54.730> that<00:04:56.590> actually<00:04:57.590> I'm<00:04:57.860> sorry<00:04:58.040> it<00:04:58.190> goes

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
like that actually I'm sorry it goes

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.290 
like that actually I'm sorry it goes
under<00:04:58.700> both<00:04:58.910> I<00:05:00.220> just<00:05:01.220> usually<00:05:01.700> do<00:05:01.880> it<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.180> not

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
under both I just usually do it and not

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.150 
under both I just usually do it and not
even<00:05:02.360> think<00:05:02.780> so<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.050> goes<00:05:03.200> under<00:05:03.530> this<00:05:03.740> one<00:05:03.950> and

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
even think so it goes under this one and

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.370 
even think so it goes under this one and
under<00:05:04.640> this<00:05:04.790> short<00:05:05.120> one<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:05.990> started

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
under this short one that you started

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.630 
under this short one that you started
with<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:06.770> your<00:05:06.950> crease<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.730> gonna<00:05:07.880> go<00:05:08.090> up<00:05:08.870> under

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
with so your crease is gonna go up under

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.210 
with so your crease is gonna go up under
both<00:05:10.640> of<00:05:10.670> those<00:05:11.290> so<00:05:12.290> it's<00:05:12.440> nice<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.710> hidden

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
both of those so it's nice and hidden

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.920 
both of those so it's nice and hidden
back<00:05:13.400> there<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.720> should

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
back there and so this is so you should

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.840 
back there and so this is so you should
have<00:05:15.050> one<00:05:15.290> loop<00:05:15.470> two<00:05:15.830> loops<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.280> three<00:05:16.610> loops

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
have one loop two loops and three loops

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.170 
have one loop two loops and three loops
and<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:17.270> for<00:05:18.260> our<00:05:18.350> fourth<00:05:18.650> loop<00:05:19.030> you're<00:05:20.030> gonna

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
and now for our fourth loop you're gonna

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.000 
and now for our fourth loop you're gonna
take<00:05:20.450> your<00:05:20.570> tail<00:05:20.840> of<00:05:21.050> your<00:05:21.200> ribbon<00:05:21.440> again<00:05:21.590> and

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
take your tail of your ribbon again and

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.340 
take your tail of your ribbon again and
now<00:05:22.190> we're<00:05:22.370> gonna<00:05:22.490> fold<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.060> over<00:05:23.570> but<00:05:24.050> we<00:05:24.140> have

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
now we're gonna fold it over but we have

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.410 
now we're gonna fold it over but we have
to<00:05:24.500> angle<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.950> so<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.400> is<00:05:25.700> my<00:05:25.850> crease<00:05:26.180> right

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
to angle it so this is my crease right

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.160 
to angle it so this is my crease right
here<00:05:26.480> and<00:05:26.960> I'm<00:05:27.770> gonna<00:05:27.890> angle<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.810> again<00:05:29.810> and

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
here and I'm gonna angle it again and

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.340 
here and I'm gonna angle it again and
it's<00:05:30.620> gonna<00:05:30.770> match<00:05:31.100> up<00:05:31.370> with<00:05:31.520> this<00:05:31.700> right<00:05:31.970> here

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
it's gonna match up with this right here

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.040 
it's gonna match up with this right here
so<00:05:33.350> everything<00:05:33.860> should<00:05:34.070> line<00:05:34.400> up<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.870> can

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
so everything should line up and you can

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.820 
so everything should line up and you can
see<00:05:36.200> it's<00:05:36.350> lined<00:05:36.590> up<00:05:36.770> down<00:05:36.950> here<00:05:37.250> too<00:05:38.830> so

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
see it's lined up down here too so

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.440 
see it's lined up down here too so
that's<00:05:40.070> what<00:05:40.370> you<00:05:40.490> should<00:05:40.520> that's<00:05:40.940> what<00:05:41.330> the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
that's what you should that's what the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.600 
that's what you should that's what the
front<00:05:41.720> should<00:05:41.870> look<00:05:42.080> like<00:05:42.280> that's<00:05:43.280> what<00:05:43.460> the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
front should look like that's what the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.990 
front should look like that's what the
back<00:05:43.790> should<00:05:44.030> look<00:05:44.210> like<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.950> then<00:05:46.400> you

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
back should look like and then you

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.460 
back should look like and then you
should<00:05:47.060> already<00:05:47.390> have<00:05:47.510> your<00:05:47.660> wire<00:05:48.380> ready<00:05:53.470> okay

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
should already have your wire ready okay

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.140 
should already have your wire ready okay
and<00:05:54.710> so<00:05:54.920> and<00:05:55.040> then<00:05:55.160> we're<00:05:55.340> gonna<00:05:55.460> accordion

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
and so and then we're gonna accordion

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.570 
and so and then we're gonna accordion
fold<00:05:56.540> so<00:05:56.840> we're<00:05:56.990> folding<00:05:57.230> up<00:05:57.680> on<00:05:58.160> both<00:05:58.550> sides

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
fold so we're folding up on both sides

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.540 
fold so we're folding up on both sides
and<00:05:59.360> then<00:06:00.230> down<00:06:01.210> just<00:06:02.210> like<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.980> up<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.310> then

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
and then down just like that up and then

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.650 
and then down just like that up and then
down<00:06:05.440> so<00:06:06.440> then<00:06:06.620> it's<00:06:06.830> like<00:06:06.920> we<00:06:07.160> have<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.340> little

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
down so then it's like we have a little

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.280 
down so then it's like we have a little
mouth<00:06:08.660> on<00:06:09.050> the<00:06:09.770> top<00:06:10.010> there<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.780> then<00:06:11.840> you're

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
mouth on the top there and then you're

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.880 
mouth on the top there and then you're
just<00:06:12.410> gonna<00:06:12.590> take<00:06:12.890> your<00:06:13.040> wire<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:14.030> wrap<00:06:14.480> it

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
just gonna take your wire and wrap it

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.960 
just gonna take your wire and wrap it
nice<00:06:15.890> tight<00:06:16.460> around<00:06:18.340> and<00:06:19.340> then<00:06:19.640> now<00:06:19.820> you're

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
nice tight around and then now you're

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.730 
nice tight around and then now you're
gonna<00:06:20.090> check<00:06:20.420> it<00:06:20.660> before<00:06:20.780> you<00:06:21.050> tighten<00:06:21.470> your

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
gonna check it before you tighten your

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.260 
gonna check it before you tighten your
wife<00:06:21.950> you<00:06:22.340> want<00:06:22.490> to<00:06:22.580> make<00:06:22.700> sure<00:06:22.730> your<00:06:23.030> loops

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
wife you want to make sure your loops

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.050 
wife you want to make sure your loops
are<00:06:23.510> all<00:06:23.620> even<00:06:24.620> that<00:06:25.040> you<00:06:25.160> have<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:25.550> wire<00:06:25.730> in

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
are all even that you have the wire in

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.080 
are all even that you have the wire in
the<00:06:26.210> center<00:06:26.800> so<00:06:27.800> that<00:06:27.830> looks<00:06:28.220> pretty<00:06:28.490> good

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
the center so that looks pretty good

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.910 
the center so that looks pretty good
so<00:06:29.570> I'm<00:06:29.660> gonna<00:06:29.810> go<00:06:29.990> ahead<00:06:30.110> and<00:06:30.410> tighten<00:06:30.650> my

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
wire it's one of the two ends on the

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.740 
wire it's one of the two ends on the
back<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:34.370> I'm<00:06:34.580> just<00:06:34.730> gonna<00:06:34.910> pull<00:06:35.300> both<00:06:35.540> of

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
back and I'm just gonna pull both of

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.620 
back and I'm just gonna pull both of
those<00:06:35.930> separately

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
those separately

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.270 
those separately
