00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:01.199 
so I'm going to do a little

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.919 
so I'm going to do a little
demonstration<00:00:01.439> on<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.540> you<00:00:03.540> can<00:00:03.659> make<00:00:03.810> it

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
demonstration on how you can make it

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.140 
demonstration on how you can make it
resists<00:00:04.319> with<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> stencil<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.339> metallic

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
resists with a stencil and metallic

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.540 
resists with a stencil and metallic
scraping<00:00:06.540> metallic<00:00:06.740> spray<00:00:07.740> paint<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.099> used<00:00:08.309> for

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
scraping metallic spray paint I used for

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.790 
scraping metallic spray paint I used for
this<00:00:08.670> particular<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.300> was<00:00:09.599> Rustoleum<00:00:10.380> quite

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this particular one was Rustoleum quite

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.370 
this particular one was Rustoleum quite
long<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.250> very<00:00:11.599> very<00:00:12.599> shiny<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.259> it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
long as it's very very shiny and it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.919 
long as it's very very shiny and it
creates<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> great<00:00:13.920> resist<00:00:14.370> well<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
creates a great resist well we do this

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
creates a great resist well we do this
I'm<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:16.830> ahead<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> we've<00:00:17.310> got

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I'm going to go ahead and the we've got

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.279 
I'm going to go ahead and the we've got
our<00:00:17.640> twinks<00:00:18.000> nice<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> wet<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.840> we're<00:00:19.199> just

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
our twinks nice and wet and we're just

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.340 
our twinks nice and wet and we're just
moving<00:00:19.439> circles<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.310> each<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.180> Roses<00:00:21.630> just

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
moving circles on each of the Roses just

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.660 
moving circles on each of the Roses just
a<00:00:22.470> circle<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> way<00:00:23.760> around<00:00:24.590> and<00:00:25.670> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
a circle all the way around and the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.040 
a circle all the way around and the
reason<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.000> doing<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:27.630> i<00:00:27.810> want

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
reason I'm doing that is because i want

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.259 
reason I'm doing that is because i want
the<00:00:28.340> center<00:00:29.340> part<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> Roses<00:00:30.029> where<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the center part of the Roses where the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.910 
the center part of the Roses where the
detail<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.040> to<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
detail is to have a little bit a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.910 
detail is to have a little bit a
different<00:00:34.920> shade<00:00:35.160> or<00:00:35.430> different<00:00:35.730> color<00:00:35.940> then

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
different shade or different color then

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.260 
different shade or different color then
all<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.129> around<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> outside<00:00:38.460> where

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
all the way around the outside where

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
all the way around the outside where
it's<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.719> green<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.250> how

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it's going to be green you can see how

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819 
it's going to be green you can see how
it's<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.550> bubbling<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.440> that's<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.649> it's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's all bubbling up that's because it's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.670 
it's all bubbling up that's because it's
major<00:00:44.070> resist<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.289> everywhere<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> it's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
major resist and everywhere that it's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860 
major resist and everywhere that it's
not<00:00:46.980> bubbling<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> sink<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
not bubbling it's going to sink in and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
not bubbling it's going to sink in and
tint<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> paper<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.789> got<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> coal<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
tint the paper we just got a coal what I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
tint the paper we just got a coal what I
like<00:00:52.260> about<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.500> technique<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
like about this technique is that you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
like about this technique is that you
don't<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.180> any<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.890> artist

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
don't have to be any kind of artist

you can't really mess it up which really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
you can't really mess it up which really
makes<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
makes it this you can use this as a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.300 
makes it this you can use this as a
background<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.020> maybe<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.470> art<00:01:16.740> journaling

maybe a card maybe a cool scrapbook page
you<00:01:24.750> notice<00:01:25.020> too<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.770> really

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
you notice too that I'm not really

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.560 
you notice too that I'm not really
making<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> same<00:01:27.990> color<00:01:28.439> because

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
making them all the same color because

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.120 
making them all the same color because
let's<00:01:30.570> face<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.930> no<00:01:31.110> two<00:01:31.170> roses<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> same

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
let's face it no two roses are the same
right<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.270> different<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.869> little

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
right they all look different a little

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.300 
right they all look different a little
bit

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
bit

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.880 
bit
changes<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.340> color<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:38.590> I'm<00:01:38.649> going<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.799> do

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
changes in color so what I'm going to do

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.789 
changes in color so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:39.009> I'm<00:01:39.100> just<00:01:39.130> going<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.429> let<00:01:39.549> this<00:01:39.729> sit<00:01:40.679> dip<00:01:41.679> in

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
is I'm just going to let this sit dip in

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.969 
is I'm just going to let this sit dip in
this<00:01:41.920> long<00:01:42.179> let<00:01:43.179> this<00:01:43.329> sit<00:01:43.600> for<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.840> minute<00:01:44.109> and

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
this long let this sit for a minute and

this long let this sit for a minute and
while<00:01:45.189> we're<00:01:45.280> waiting<00:01:45.609> to<00:01:45.670> sit<00:01:45.909> we<00:01:46.000> got<00:01:46.119> a

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
while we're waiting to sit we got a

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.819 
while we're waiting to sit we got a
cleaning<00:01:46.479> brush<00:01:46.600> really<00:01:46.899> well<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:50.500> ahead<00:01:50.710> and
