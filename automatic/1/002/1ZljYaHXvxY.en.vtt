that<00:00:41.010> we'll<00:00:41.100> talk<00:00:41.250> about<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.700> some<00:00:42.180> vor

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that we'll talk about are some vor

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.170 
that we'll talk about are some vor
basics<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.950> we'll<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.280> into<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> instrument

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
basics then we'll go into the instrument

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.690 
basics then we'll go into the instrument
and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> parts<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> instrument<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
and the parts of the instrument and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.650 
and the parts of the instrument and
finally<00:00:47.700> we'll<00:00:47.850> talk<00:00:48.030> about<00:00:48.329> its<00:00:48.480> actual

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
finally we'll talk about its actual

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.090 
finally we'll talk about its actual
usage

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.420 

the<00:00:53.060> first<00:00:53.329> key<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.570> using<00:00:53.960> vor<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.220> think

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the first key to using vor is to think

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.280 
the first key to using vor is to think
in<00:00:55.520> terms<00:00:55.820> of<00:00:56.030> radials<00:00:58.930> radials<00:00:59.930> are<00:01:00.170> the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
in terms of radials radials are the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.960 
in terms of radials radials are the
signal<00:01:00.620> that's<00:01:00.770> broadcast<00:01:01.280> out<00:01:01.489> from<00:01:01.820> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
signal that's broadcast out from the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.880 
signal that's broadcast out from the
station<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.570> are<00:01:03.530> oriented<00:01:04.160> toward<00:01:05.890> magnetic

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
station and are oriented toward magnetic

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
station and are oriented toward magnetic
north

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.920 

this<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.100> zero<00:01:11.490> degrees<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.210> magnetic<00:01:12.600> north

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
this is zero degrees from magnetic north

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.270 
this is zero degrees from magnetic north
and<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> zero<00:01:14.520> degree<00:01:14.909> radial<00:01:16.280> this

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and so it's the zero degree radial this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
and so it's the zero degree radial this
would<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.670> 90<00:01:17.940> degrees<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.600> magnetic<00:01:19.110> north

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
would be 90 degrees from magnetic north

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.980 
would be 90 degrees from magnetic north
and<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> zero<00:01:20.220> Niner<00:01:20.520> zero<00:01:20.640> radial<00:01:23.990> 180

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
and is the zero Niner zero radial 180

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
and is the zero Niner zero radial 180
degrees<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.560> magnetic<00:01:26.100> north<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.970> one

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
degrees from magnetic north is the one

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
degrees from magnetic north is the one
eight<00:01:27.330> zero<00:01:27.360> degree<00:01:28.050> radial<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:30.770> 270<00:01:31.770> degrees

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
eight zero degree radial and 270 degrees

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.270 
eight zero degree radial and 270 degrees
from<00:01:32.280> magnetic<00:01:32.700> north<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> two<00:01:34.740> seven

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
from magnetic north is the two seven

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
from magnetic north is the two seven

we<00:02:49.150> need<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.540> navigate<00:02:50.020> using<00:02:50.350> vor<00:02:52.530> now<00:02:53.530> let's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
we need to navigate using vor now let's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.230 
we need to navigate using vor now let's
look<00:02:53.860> at<00:02:53.980> an<00:02:54.100> example<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.670> how<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:54.910> would<00:02:55.209> use

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
look at an example of how we would use

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.080 
look at an example of how we would use
the<00:02:55.660> vor<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.230> navigate<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.580> first<00:02:57.819> thing<00:02:57.970> that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the vor to navigate the first thing that

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.770 
the vor to navigate the first thing that
we<00:02:58.150> would<00:02:58.300> want<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.630> do<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:59.760> turn<00:03:00.760> our<00:03:01.000> OBS<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
we would want to do is turn our OBS and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.300 
we would want to do is turn our OBS and
select<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.709> radial<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.730> our<00:03:04.150> example<00:03:05.010> let's<00:03:06.010> use

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
select a radial in our example let's use

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.240 
select a radial in our example let's use
the<00:03:06.520> 0<00:03:06.790> 9<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.240> 0<00:03:07.270> radial<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:14.709> first<00:03:14.950> thing<00:03:15.130> that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the 0 9 or 0 radial the first thing that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.010 
the 0 9 or 0 radial the first thing that
you<00:03:15.310> need<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.580> do<00:03:15.700> when<00:03:15.850> using<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.270> vor<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.840> to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
you need to do when using the vor is to

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.530 
you need to do when using the vor is to
think<00:03:17.319> in<00:03:17.470> terms<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.190> radial<00:03:18.640> think<00:03:19.330> in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
think in terms of that radial think in

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.570 
think in terms of that radial think in
that<00:03:19.660> direction<00:03:19.800> we<00:03:20.800> don't<00:03:21.010> know<00:03:21.160> which<00:03:21.340> way

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
that direction we don't know which way

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.060 
that direction we don't know which way
our<00:03:21.790> aircraft<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.330> actually<00:03:22.810> facing<00:03:23.230> but<00:03:23.950> to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
our aircraft is actually facing but to

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.340 
our aircraft is actually facing but to
use<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.489> vor<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:25.209> need<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.510> imagine<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.230> we

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
use the vor we need to imagine that we

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.830 
use the vor we need to imagine that we
would<00:03:26.620> face<00:03:27.100> 0<00:03:27.730> 9<00:03:28.000> 0<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:31.000> were<00:03:31.180> facing<00:03:31.390> in

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
would face 0 9 0 if we were facing in

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.680 
would face 0 9 0 if we were facing in
that<00:03:32.830> direction<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:34.380> left<00:03:35.640> cd-i<00:03:36.690> indication

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
that direction a left cd-i indication

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.960 
that direction a left cd-i indication
would<00:03:38.440> mean<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.950> radial<00:03:39.340> would<00:03:39.550> be<00:03:39.700> to

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
would mean that the radial would be to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.840 
would mean that the radial would be to
our<00:03:40.000> left<00:03:40.450> if<00:03:41.200> that's<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.800> case<00:03:41.950> then<00:03:42.670> we

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
our left if that's the case then we

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:52.930 
our left if that's the case then we
would<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:43.120> somewhere<00:03:43.480> on<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.900> side

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.370 

then<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.150> would<00:03:54.300> look<00:03:54.420> at<00:03:54.540> our<00:03:54.660> two<00:03:54.840> front<00:03:55.140> flag

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
then we would look at our two front flag

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.980 
then we would look at our two front flag
a<00:03:57.350> two<00:03:58.350> indication<00:03:59.160> would<00:04:00.000> mean<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.480> if<00:04:00.690> our

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
a two indication would mean that if our

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.460 
a two indication would mean that if our
aircraft<00:04:01.560> was<00:04:01.770> facing<00:04:02.340> heading

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
aircraft was facing heading

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.140 
aircraft was facing heading
zero-niner-zero

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
zero-niner-zero

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.950 
zero-niner-zero
that<00:04:06.150> would<00:04:06.390> be<00:04:06.540> taking<00:04:06.900> us<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.740> station

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
that would be taking us to the station

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.300 
that would be taking us to the station
so<00:04:09.960> our<00:04:10.080> aircraft<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.650> somewhere<00:04:10.950> on<00:04:11.010> this

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so our aircraft is somewhere on this

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:20.120 
so our aircraft is somewhere on this
side

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.950 

combining<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.340> information<00:04:22.000> we<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.600> see

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
combining this information we can see

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.200 
combining this information we can see
that<00:04:23.110> our<00:04:23.230> aircraft<00:04:23.680> must<00:04:23.920> be<00:04:24.160> somewhere<00:04:24.730> to

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
that our aircraft must be somewhere to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.180 
that our aircraft must be somewhere to
the<00:04:25.330> southwest<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.260> this<00:04:27.070> vor<00:04:27.580> station<00:04:30.750> in

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
the southwest of this vor station in

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.700 
the southwest of this vor station in
this<00:04:33.190> example<00:04:33.580> we're<00:04:33.850> going<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.150> select<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
this example we're going to select the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:50.060 
this example we're going to select the
two<00:04:36.340> four<00:04:37.180> zero<00:04:37.830> radial

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.720 

let's<00:04:50.670> give<00:04:50.880> ourselves<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.950> right<00:04:52.950> cd-i

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
let's give ourselves a right cd-i

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.440 
let's give ourselves a right cd-i
indication<00:04:56.660> and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.340 

a<00:05:00.530> two<00:05:01.530> on<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.160> two<00:05:02.340> front<00:05:02.640> flag

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.680 

once<00:05:07.950> again<00:05:08.100> we<00:05:08.370> need<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.640> think<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.270> this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
once again we need to think in this

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.070 
once again we need to think in this
direction<00:05:10.290> if<00:05:10.680> our<00:05:11.670> aircraft<00:05:12.180> was<00:05:12.450> facing<00:05:12.930> to

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
direction if our aircraft was facing to

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.360 
direction if our aircraft was facing to
4-0<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.940> radial<00:05:15.330> would<00:05:15.510> be<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.840> our<00:05:15.990> right

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
4-0 the radial would be to our right

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.160 
4-0 the radial would be to our right
that<00:05:17.370> means<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.790> we<00:05:18.090> would<00:05:18.270> be<00:05:18.450> somewhere<00:05:18.960> on

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
that means that we would be somewhere on

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.940 
that means that we would be somewhere on
this<00:05:19.440> side<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.790> radial<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.440> again<00:05:22.440> if<00:05:22.650> we

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
this side of this radial and again if we

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.860 
this side of this radial and again if we
were<00:05:23.190> facing<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:24.210> 4-0<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:27.000> would<00:05:27.210> take<00:05:27.390> us<00:05:27.570> to

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
were facing to 4-0 that would take us to

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.590 
were facing to 4-0 that would take us to
the<00:05:28.080> station<00:05:28.290> so<00:05:29.040> we<00:05:29.190> must<00:05:29.400> be<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:30.330> side

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
the station so we must be on this side

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.080 
the station so we must be on this side
of<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.930> station

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
of the station

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.260 
of the station
knowing<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:34.580> combining<00:05:35.580> this<00:05:35.670> information

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
knowing this combining this information

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.230 
knowing this combining this information
we<00:05:36.780> can<00:05:36.960> see<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.290> we<00:05:37.380> must<00:05:37.590> be<00:05:37.770> somewhere

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
we can see that we must be somewhere

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.090 
we can see that we must be somewhere
generally<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.450> southeast<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.380> this

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
generally to the southeast of this

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:50.960 
generally to the southeast of this
station<00:05:49.190> now<00:05:50.190> let's<00:05:50.370> look<00:05:50.520> at<00:05:50.640> one<00:05:50.940> more

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
station now let's look at one more

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.530 
station now let's look at one more
example

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:02.110 

this<00:05:55.140> time<00:05:56.150> we'll<00:05:57.150> use<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:59.870> three<00:06:00.870> one<00:06:01.650> zero

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
this time we'll use the three one zero

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:11.930 
this time we'll use the three one zero
radial

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.740 

but<00:06:12.940> now<00:06:13.180> our<00:06:13.510> CDI<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.200> centered<00:06:15.420> this<00:06:16.420> tells

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
but now our CDI is centered this tells

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.900 
but now our CDI is centered this tells
us<00:06:16.900> that<00:06:16.960> we<00:06:17.260> are<00:06:17.290> somewhere<00:06:17.830> right<00:06:18.250> along<00:06:18.700> the

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
us that we are somewhere right along the

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.010 
us that we are somewhere right along the
line<00:06:19.120> of<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.540> radial<00:06:19.900> if<00:06:21.420> we<00:06:22.420> have<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.630> from

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
line of the radial if we have a from

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.300 
line of the radial if we have a from
indication<00:06:25.380> that<00:06:26.380> means<00:06:26.650> that<00:06:26.830> if<00:06:27.010> our

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
indication that means that if our

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.030 
indication that means that if our
aircraft<00:06:27.850> was<00:06:28.090> facing<00:06:28.480> three<00:06:28.780> one<00:06:28.960> zero<00:06:29.040> that

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
aircraft was facing three one zero that

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.030 
aircraft was facing three one zero that
would<00:06:30.160> take<00:06:30.370> us<00:06:30.520> away<00:06:30.940> from<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.990> station<00:06:32.380> so

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
would take us away from the station so

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.240 
would take us away from the station so
we<00:06:33.130> must<00:06:33.310> be<00:06:33.430> on<00:06:33.610> this<00:06:33.820> side<00:06:34.120> of<00:06:34.450> the<00:06:34.570> station

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
we must be on this side of the station

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.130 
we must be on this side of the station
somewhere<00:06:36.250> along<00:06:36.670> the<00:06:36.940> line<00:06:37.150> of<00:06:37.420> the<00:06:37.780> radial

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
somewhere along the line of the radial

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.610 
somewhere along the line of the radial
as<00:06:39.690> you<00:06:40.690> can<00:06:40.840> see<00:06:40.990> it<00:06:41.110> gives<00:06:41.260> you<00:06:41.350> a<00:06:41.380> much<00:06:41.560> more

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
as you can see it gives you a much more

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.070 
as you can see it gives you a much more
accurate<00:06:41.800> position<00:06:42.640> if<00:06:42.820> you<00:06:43.450> have<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.750> CDI

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
accurate position if you have the CDI

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.460 
accurate position if you have the CDI
centered<00:06:48.720> that's<00:06:49.720> all<00:06:49.900> you<00:06:50.020> really<00:06:50.140> need<00:06:50.440> to

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
centered that's all you really need to

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.680 
centered that's all you really need to
know<00:06:50.680> to<00:06:50.740> navigate<00:06:51.250> with<00:06:51.400> vor<00:06:51.850> just<00:06:52.360> remember

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
know to navigate with vor just remember

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.600 
know to navigate with vor just remember
to<00:06:52.810> think<00:06:52.990> first<00:06:53.380> in<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:54.010> direction<00:06:54.250> of<00:06:54.460> the

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
to think first in the direction of the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.700 
to think first in the direction of the
radial<00:06:54.940> if<00:06:55.140> you're<00:06:56.140> thinking<00:06:56.470> in<00:06:56.560> that

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
radial if you're thinking in that

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.070 
radial if you're thinking in that
direction<00:06:56.890> then<00:06:57.670> the<00:06:57.910> CDI<00:06:58.210> tells<00:06:58.540> you<00:06:58.750> if<00:06:58.900> the

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
direction then the CDI tells you if the

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.600 
direction then the CDI tells you if the
radial<00:06:59.440> is<00:06:59.560> to<00:06:59.710> your<00:06:59.830> left<00:07:00.040> or<00:07:00.280> to<00:07:00.430> your<00:07:00.460> right

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
radial is to your left or to your right

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.420 
radial is to your left or to your right
the<00:07:01.540> two<00:07:01.750> from<00:07:02.020> flag<00:07:02.260> tells<00:07:02.560> you<00:07:02.770> if<00:07:03.040> flying

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
the two from flag tells you if flying

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.100 
the two from flag tells you if flying
that<00:07:03.700> radial<00:07:04.030> would<00:07:04.210> take<00:07:04.360> you<00:07:04.510> toward<00:07:04.840> or

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
that radial would take you toward or

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.690 
that radial would take you toward or
away<00:07:05.140> from<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.590> station<00:07:06.040> and<00:07:06.190> that's

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:06.700 
away from the station and that's

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.940 
away from the station and that's
basically<00:07:07.120> all<00:07:07.240> there<00:07:07.390> is<00:07:07.690> to<00:07:07.900> there<00:07:08.650> are<00:07:08.770> some

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
basically all there is to there are some

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.410 
basically all there is to there are some

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
details that we didn't talk about the

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.570 
details that we didn't talk about the
