00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.280
 we are here in the flÃ¤ming 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.049
 station that is the body of the body 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.170
 They retracted this station 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.730
 exactly on your reference point 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 clamped in a defined position 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 situation and brought in this station 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 then are the attachments speak the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.160
 doors the front door and the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.660
 Side parts exactly accurate and accurate 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.560
 attached to the body 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 while the highest precision is called for what 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 happens over this device the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.739
 Side panels and doors are on this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 slide devices stored and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.629
 are exactly in a defined excessive 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 situations of the body we supplied 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.520
 talk about accuracy in the here 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.620
 Cent area We have customer tolerance 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.719
 and skill tolerance em 33 cents 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.449
 area and then the hinges 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.789
 attached and the doors and hoods and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 the side parts screwed to the causa 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.850
 why do you do that , of course you want 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.830
 an optimal picture of the joints 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.689
 from the doors at home and also from the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
 achieve body at home and one 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.070
 Cleanliness means no 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 surviving the door at home or not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.410
 shelter 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.600
 how sensitive the material aluminum is 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.210
 you can see from the next station in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.980
 Body shop here is a lot of feeling 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 asked 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.880
 the body of the supercar becomes 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 caressed literally 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.860
 we are here last 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.789
 Work step in the body shop in 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.130
 so-called in the finish cabin learns the 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.659
 check her last fine finish as before 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.179
 treatment step before entering the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.679
 Lackiererei comes what happens here then 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.539
 Employee feels with the test 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.069
 gloves the surfaces relevant 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.289
 areas and pulls them with the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.509
 intent on also a minimum 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.469
 surface defects or damage 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.380
 detect 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.179
 where do such surface damage come from 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.459
 if you can imagine such a thing 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.590
 sheet metal part like the front but order roof 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.270
 can be made a small 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.069
 sparse particles smaller foreign body in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.380
 There is no dust to be found far beyond 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.810
 Could be a hair for a pimple too 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.069
 a pointy bump and these minimal ones 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.840
 You can go through surface damage 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.890
 remove and fill detect the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.930
 You can then loop through here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.340
 eliminate them after the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.299
 painting process in front of the customer not 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.250
 disturbing is the surface of the 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.349
 raw body is perfect in the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 paint shop 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:33.290
 in total, the audi r8 has gt 5 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.299
 individual lacquer layers on phosphate and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.290
 Filler will cover and clear coat 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.290
 applied 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.319
 Here begins the loading of the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.530
 Body on average will be pro 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.530
 station installed between 50 and 70 parts 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:59.120
 the heart of the r8 gt is the ten-cylinder 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:02.270
 motor the 560 ps unit brings 258 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.150
 kilogram on the scales and is thus 48 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.130
 kilo heavier than the body shell we 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.430
 stand here six in our r8 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.340
 manufactory, the installation of the engine 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.010
 geared him into the vehicle 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.510
 the mid-engine vehicle therefore needs 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.500
 one drives engines from behind into 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.630
 bring in the vehicle 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.640
 in normal vehicle construction we have one 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.100
 Installation of the complete engine set 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.320
 motor gear drive shafts and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.300
 landing gear from the bottom of the vehicle 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.860
 a construction car with us because of the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.490
 other vehicle concept that is not so 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.960
 possible 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.310
 That's why we have the wedding station 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.410
 divided into two steps first 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.480
 Stepped a cotton plants from behind 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.120
 Second step Installation of color 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.370
 components then quite normal rat for rad 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.230
 in the vehicle the clock time here in the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.750
 montage is the same everywhere at 30 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.760
 minutes per working cycle that is in 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.440
 This 30.2 minutes will not only 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.600
 motors gear built but 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.580
 Of course, other built-in 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.739
 These can be tracked as for example 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.440
 the sky the sunshine line 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.540
 put the engine room exude for 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.330
 the stiffness magnesium carrier the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.780
 Things are all here in the area 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.880
 around all control systems and sensors of the r8 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.220
 to connect three kilometers to 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.860
 cable installed the cockpit of the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.610
 super sportsman weighs just 35 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.610
 kilogram 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.220
 as standard the gt gets one 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.530
 Ceramic brake system thereby becomes beside 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.759
 the better braking performance also 20 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.759
 kilogram weight saved
