00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Vega welcome youth room in montreal 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.950
 you show five fatal errors or 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.330
 the express for really fatal but 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.740
 still serious mistakes we do not have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.210
 did or croatia in one that would 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.799
 really dangerous for your health that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 I want to finish with only the first 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.930
 mistake is to start with the bath 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 too inclined you want here an angle 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.330
 about 90 degrees between the cushion 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 who is there and then the bath if your bath 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 and too influential but like this one this 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.109
 what will happen is when the load 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.059
 going down on your feet you're going 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.040
 have to hold the wrists very hard for 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.469
 do not slide on the bath the load 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.899
 you push indicates if your bath was 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.420
 more inclined you are calais well at 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.370
 bottom of the bath and the charge of maintaining 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.610
 instead I feel right now I love him 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.430
 it's like we know less than that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 that's the first mistake the second 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.579
 mistake is when you classify your 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.379
 feet on the square 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 there are people who spontaneously go 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.730
 put the foot I'm not going well 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:07.799
 they go to the camera there I have all the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.189
 Piebalgs boots six months life at the club and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.290
 who have for example on the platform 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.110
 is very important above all the foot 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.110
 on the platform for a lot it's going 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 be important to control the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 movement 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:33.270
 and if you have half that it was 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 the mistake follow so we're here I'm going 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 well placed back if I told you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:47.880
 convenience of about 90 degrees that's it 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.930
 mean for me and the ranks of which 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.079
 I was going to talk to you make yourself a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 movement that is too short for example 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.649
 people will move like that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.070
 Here then devised immediately the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.500
 charge 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.980
 we believe her cause the mechanics of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.930
 movement 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.850
 the way the machine is doing is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 done and the way we are placed 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 we can put very heavy and if you 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.330
 make a movement that is short as 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.040
 this here at the end of the movement 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
 you will put even more water 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.060
 it's not necessary to put as much 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.100
 for especially if you make a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.010
 partial movement like that so you 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.590
 want an amplitude where your legs are going 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.780
 to be vertical in relation to the ground 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.880
 more and they bother next it's 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.070
 people who go too far to the lake near 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.990
 what they will win the knees I know 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.910
 that in the chest like that that's 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.220
 dangerous for two reasons the first 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.350
 is that in life every day we 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.240
 never gets back with the knee in the 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.820
 chest to his thoughts an activity where 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.780
 I'm stuck like it works 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.520
 actually my highest knee who wants 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 lift that's it so I can not find 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.180
 never to ride knee so far in the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.220
 life every day so we left 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.290
 work in that attitude and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.000
 it's not necessary to increase 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.620
 our strength in this attitude there at 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.870
 level of the joints it can pose 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.160
 problems and the second reason 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.500
 face taxes is that my knees 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.780
 to the chest 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:17.610
 precisely because the end the good my 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:27.840
 back we tend to take off on the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:29.400
 see here to wind up and it stands from 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.440
 training between a mac that's what makes 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.440
 that he is a great athletic method 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:04:01.080
 so that's the simple you have to 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:04:03.590
 always while you do your 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.590
 series 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.209
 and as you are going to have you go 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.650
 lead your hearts up to the vertical 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.650
 your donations will not be tempted to me 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.760
