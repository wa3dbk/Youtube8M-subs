00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
the advantage of this what what do you

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.200 
the advantage of this what what do you
want<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.049> get<00:00:53.170> here<00:00:53.639> the<00:00:54.639> first<00:00:54.909> and<00:00:55.089> most

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
want to get here the first and most

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.049 
want to get here the first and most
important<00:00:55.989> one<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.350> top<00:00:57.069> load<00:00:57.309> stage<00:00:57.609> it<00:00:57.819> still

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
important one is top load stage it still

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.520 
important one is top load stage it still
holds<00:00:58.239> 24<00:00:58.989> x<00:00:59.139> 56<00:00:59.709> filters<00:01:00.549> but<00:01:01.179> now<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:02.229> rear

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
holds 24 x 56 filters but now the rear

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.770 
holds 24 x 56 filters but now the rear
one<00:01:02.769> which<00:01:02.979> is<00:01:03.159> still<00:01:03.609> rotating<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.330> rotating

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
one which is still rotating the rotating

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.929 
one which is still rotating the rotating
on<00:01:04.839> both<00:01:04.989> but<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.440> rear<00:01:05.619> one<00:01:05.829> is<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.310> top<00:01:06.670> load

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
on both but the rear one is a top load

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.230 
on both but the rear one is a top load
and<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:07.329> it<00:01:07.450> goes<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.960> out<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.649> way<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and so it goes in and out this way and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.580 
and so it goes in and out this way and
that's<00:01:10.240> an<00:01:10.479> advantage<00:01:10.630> because<00:01:11.079> the<00:01:11.500> original

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
that's an advantage because the original

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.920 
that's an advantage because the original
map<00:01:11.979> box<00:01:12.219> was<00:01:12.399> meant<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.820> work<00:01:13.149> with<00:01:13.450> among

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
map box was meant to work with among

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.410 
map box was meant to work with among
many<00:01:14.289> other<00:01:14.469> cameras<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.039> sony<00:01:15.340> e<00:01:15.549> x1<00:01:16.030> camera

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
many other cameras the sony e x1 camera

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.539 
many other cameras the sony e x1 camera
and<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:17.109> has<00:01:17.289> a<00:01:17.320> microphone<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.039> sticks

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
and that has a microphone that sticks

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.060 
and that has a microphone that sticks
way<00:01:18.759> out<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.119> over<00:01:19.750> top<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.079> lens<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.439> you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
way out and over top to the lens and you

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.590 
way out and over top to the lens and you
just<00:01:21.219> couldn't<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.850> top<00:01:22.149> load<00:01:22.329> because<00:01:22.509> we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
just couldn't have a top load because we

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.380 
just couldn't have a top load because we
just<00:01:22.719> hit<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:22.960> so<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:24.159> rear<00:01:24.460> stage<00:01:24.789> would

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
just hit it so that rear stage would

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.810 
just hit it so that rear stage would
rotate<00:01:25.600> but<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.140> loaded<00:01:26.680> from<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.950> side<00:01:27.159> now

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
rotate but it loaded from the side now

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.760 
rotate but it loaded from the side now
you<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.240> load<00:01:28.630> from<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.960> top<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.500> reason

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
you can load from the top and the reason

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.840 
you can load from the top and the reason
that<00:01:29.799> you<00:01:29.950> might<00:01:30.070> want<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.310> load<00:01:30.399> from<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.640> top

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
that you might want to load from the top

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.719 
that you might want to load from the top
is<00:01:31.060> well<00:01:31.509> that's<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.170> kind<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.439> shape<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.920> your

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
is well that's the kind of shape of your

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.859 
is well that's the kind of shape of your
frame<00:01:34.600> 16<00:01:35.140> by<00:01:35.259> 9<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:36.340> if<00:01:36.579> you<00:01:36.939> loaded<00:01:37.719> from

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
frame 16 by 9 and so if you loaded from

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.510 
frame 16 by 9 and so if you loaded from
the<00:01:38.049> side<00:01:38.350> then<00:01:38.890> you're<00:01:39.070> going<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.219> have<00:01:39.369> to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
the side then you're going to have to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.999 
the side then you're going to have to
rotate<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.600> stage<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.200> way<00:01:41.409> in<00:01:41.590> order<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.920> be

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
rotate the stage this way in order to be

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.950 
rotate the stage this way in order to be
able<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.460> go<00:01:42.579> up<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.850> down<00:01:42.969> and<00:01:43.179> it's<00:01:43.750> going<00:01:43.899> to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
able to go up and down and it's going to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
can also get different rings that will

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.510 
can also get different rings that will
go<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.260> smaller<00:02:53.560> sizes<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.100> if<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.280> want<00:02:54.460> you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
go to smaller sizes so if you want you

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.580 
go to smaller sizes so if you want you
to<00:02:54.640> clamp<00:02:55.090> onto<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.720> smaller<00:02:56.080> lens<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.560> can

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
to clamp onto a smaller lens you can

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.830 
to clamp onto a smaller lens you can
easily<00:02:57.160> do<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.310> not<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> problem<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.570> also

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
easily do that not a problem you also

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680

that map oxidants terrific but those are
two<00:04:10.630> very<00:04:10.660> common<00:04:11.620> uses<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.459> matte<00:04:12.760> box

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
two very common uses of the matte box

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.570 
two very common uses of the matte box
that<00:04:13.360> people<00:04:13.840> would<00:04:13.989> want<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> have<00:04:14.680> these

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
that people would want to have these

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.690 
that people would want to have these
options<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:17.020> addition<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.680> very<00:04:18.400> slight

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
options in addition a very slight

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.840 
options in addition a very slight
difference<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:20.620> rear<00:04:20.980> clamp<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
difference is this rear clamp that the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.560 
difference is this rear clamp that the
clamp<00:04:22.150> here<00:04:22.419> for<00:04:23.080> going<00:04:23.950> onto<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> rods<00:04:24.610> on

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
clamp here for going onto the rods on

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.830 
clamp here for going onto the rods on
this<00:04:26.380> map<00:04:26.590> box<00:04:26.890> they<00:04:27.490> had

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
this map box they had

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.900 
this map box they had
put<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> clamp<00:04:28.260> on<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> bottom<00:04:29.190> below<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
put the clamp on the bottom below the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.490 
put the clamp on the bottom below the
ruts<00:04:30.060> cos<00:04:30.240> actually<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.630> bar<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:30.960> goes<00:04:31.260> all

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
ruts cos actually a bar that goes all

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.159 
ruts cos actually a bar that goes all
the<00:04:31.530> way<00:04:31.680> across<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.510> clamps<00:04:33.960> both

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
the way across and so it clamps both

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.570 
the way across and so it clamps both
rods<00:04:34.440> they<00:04:34.860> had<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.040> put<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.400> bottom

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
rods they had to put it on the bottom

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.150 
rods they had to put it on the bottom
because<00:04:36.180> on<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.960> original<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.740> was<00:04:37.889> on<00:04:38.040> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
because on the original it was on the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.450 
because on the original it was on the
top<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:39.840> ring<00:04:40.139> is<00:04:40.350> larger<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:41.310> there

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
top but this ring is larger and so there

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.320 
top but this ring is larger and so there
wasn't<00:04:41.639> room<00:04:42.060> at<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.840> above<00:04:43.410> these<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.729> rods

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
wasn't room at the above these the rods

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.820 
wasn't room at the above these the rods
to<00:04:45.810> be<00:04:45.900> able<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.080> put<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.229> clamp<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:46.590> they<00:04:46.680> put

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
to be able to put the clamp so they put

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.230 
to be able to put the clamp so they put
at<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:46.949> bottom<00:04:47.100> actually<00:04:47.610> prefer<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.090> way

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
at the bottom actually prefer this way

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.370 
at the bottom actually prefer this way
because<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.449> can<00:04:48.570> get<00:04:48.660> my<00:04:48.750> fingers<00:04:49.139> in<00:04:49.169> there

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
because I can get my fingers in there

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.520 
because I can get my fingers in there
easier<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.790> way<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.030> clamp<00:04:51.990> down<00:04:52.169> here

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
easier but this way you clamp down here

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.520 
easier but this way you clamp down here
and<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.460> on<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:54.479> other<00:04:54.510> version<00:04:55.050> it's

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
and it's like on the other version it's

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.980 
and it's like on the other version it's
a<00:04:55.850> ratcheting<00:04:56.850> adjustment<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:57.810> can

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
a ratcheting adjustment so that you can

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.510 
a ratcheting adjustment so that you can
position<00:04:58.139> it<00:04:58.470> however<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.889> want<00:04:59.010> that's<00:04:59.250> very

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
position it however you want that's very
