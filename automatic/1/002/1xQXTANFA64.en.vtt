00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
getting in to free riding the ride antic
could<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> great<00:00:21.750> board<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:23.039> its

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
could be a great board for you with its

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.400 
could be a great board for you with its
directional<00:00:23.760> flex<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.420> its<00:00:24.750> twinness<00:00:25.170> shape

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
directional flex and its twinness shape

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.890 
directional flex and its twinness shape
the<00:00:26.189> directional<00:00:26.730> flex<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> allow

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the directional flex is going to allow

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900 
the directional flex is going to allow
for<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.230> nose<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.250> bit<00:00:29.400> softer

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
for that nose to be a little bit softer

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.820 
for that nose to be a little bit softer
so<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> bring<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.260> ease<00:00:31.560> when

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so it's going to bring that ease when

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
so it's going to bring that ease when
we're<00:00:31.980> starting<00:00:32.399> our<00:00:32.520> turns<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.120> well<00:00:33.690> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
we're starting our turns as well is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
we're starting our turns as well is
going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> give<00:00:34.320> us<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> good<00:00:35.010> strong<00:00:35.550> hold

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
going to give us that good strong hold

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.660 
going to give us that good strong hold
as<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.750> powering<00:00:37.110> through<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.530> carves

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.920 

some<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> texts<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> antic<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
some of the texts that the antic is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
some of the texts that the antic is
going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> bring<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.250> 90<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> slimewalls

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
going to bring is the 90 a slimewalls

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
going to bring is the 90 a slimewalls
creating<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.980> quick<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> really

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
creating that really quick and really

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.119 
creating that really quick and really
clean<00:00:48.180> transfer<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> energy<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
clean transfer of energy from the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.459 
clean transfer of energy from the
movements<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:50.820> body<00:00:51.120> through<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.199> top

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
movements of our body through the top

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.920 
movements of our body through the top
sheet<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> our<00:00:52.949> board<00:00:53.250> through<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.390> sidewall

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
sheet of our board through that sidewall

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.189 
sheet of our board through that sidewall
construction<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.829> into<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> snow<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
construction and into the snow so it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
construction and into the snow so it's
really<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.210> efficient<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.329> far<00:01:00.359> as

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
really going to be efficient as far as

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.479 
really going to be efficient as far as
transferring<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.559> movement<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> body

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
transferring that movement of the body

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
transferring that movement of the body
into<00:01:03.300> reactions<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> we're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> feel

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
into reactions that we're going to feel

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070 
into reactions that we're going to feel
underneath<00:01:04.949> our<00:01:05.189> feet<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.030> carbon<00:01:06.450> array<00:01:06.659> 3

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
underneath our feet the carbon array 3

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
underneath our feet the carbon array 3
is<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> help<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.430> flex<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> board

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
is going to help as you flex the board

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.950 
is going to help as you flex the board
this<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> bindings<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this way with the bindings it's going to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
this way with the bindings it's going to
help<00:01:13.140> transfer<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.890> energy<00:01:14.030> directly<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
help transfer that energy directly to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
help transfer that energy directly to
the<00:01:15.479> contact<00:01:15.990> points<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> top<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> the
