00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
Tuesdays I have gotten some feedback

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.910 
Tuesdays I have gotten some feedback
about<00:00:16.090> it<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.430> most<00:00:18.640> part<00:00:19.920> people

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
about it and for the most part people

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.870 
about it and for the most part people
think<00:00:21.430> that<00:00:21.850> a<00:00:22.180> large<00:00:23.140> part<00:00:23.560> of<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:24.460> auctions

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
think that a large part of the auctions

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
think that a large part of the auctions
is<00:00:25.090> buying<00:00:25.360> stuff<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:26.220> while<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:27.550> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is buying stuff and while it is the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.200 
is buying stuff and while it is the
methods<00:00:29.710> that<00:00:29.920> I<00:00:29.980> use<00:00:30.100> and<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.730> methods<00:00:31.120> that

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
methods that I use and the methods that

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.250 
methods that I use and the methods that
a<00:00:31.739> lot<00:00:32.739> of<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.010> other<00:00:33.129> people<00:00:33.280> use<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:34.260> pretty

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
a lot of the other people use a pretty

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.620 
a lot of the other people use a pretty
standard<00:00:35.829> so<00:00:36.790> I'm<00:00:36.940> just<00:00:37.030> gonna<00:00:37.180> go<00:00:37.420> over<00:00:37.600> some

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
standard so I'm just gonna go over some

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.780 
standard so I'm just gonna go over some
of<00:00:37.840> them<00:00:38.050> yet<00:00:38.970> alright<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:42.130> only<00:00:42.430> sell

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790

they have a bit of 118 that's a pretty
low<00:01:43.720> bid<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:45.520> those<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.540> pretty

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
low bid and because those is a pretty

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.200 
low bid and because those is a pretty
far<00:01:47.200> down<00:01:47.500> from<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.920> cheapest<00:01:48.310> ones<00:01:48.520> those

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
far down from the cheapest ones those

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.010 
far down from the cheapest ones those
the<00:01:49.360> problem<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.840> want<00:01:50.080> on<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> bid<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
the problem you want on a bid so it's a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.950 
the problem you want on a bid so it's a
good<00:01:53.170> way<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.320> get<00:01:53.560> some<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.920> them<00:01:54.270> check<00:01:55.270> check

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
good way to get some of them check check

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.679 
good way to get some of them check check
each<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.619> gems<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.430> way<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.540> eyes

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
each of the gems is in this way the eyes

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.929 
each of the gems is in this way the eyes
are<00:01:58.900> pretty<00:01:59.110> low<00:01:59.409> see<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.100> bid<00:02:00.369> one<00:02:00.520> there<00:02:00.700> for<00:02:00.880> a

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
are pretty low see I bid one there for a

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.990 
are pretty low see I bid one there for a
hundred<00:02:01.119> go<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.470> sixth<00:02:03.369> one<00:02:03.520> down

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
hundred go it's the sixth one down

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.899 
hundred go it's the sixth one down
so<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.270> mean<00:02:04.540> fifth<00:02:05.530> one<00:02:05.740> it's<00:02:06.369> probably<00:02:06.610> not

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
so I mean fifth one it's probably not

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.510 
so I mean fifth one it's probably not
