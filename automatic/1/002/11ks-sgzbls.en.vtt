00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.689
 today we are going to see the daily inspections 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.430
 which must be taken into account before 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.370
 start any work day 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.710
 well for this inspection is necessary 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.450
 lift the cabin for which we must 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.630
 take preventive measures into account 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.609
 necessary, it is important to check that the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.439
 inside there are no objects or 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.419
 tools that can impact the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.400
 glass when making this 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:31.230
 procedure to raise the cabin 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 we remove the safety pin and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 we pull the lever completely 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500
 cabin lock 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.140
 always make sure to lock the pin 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.989
 security 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.180
 for safety his left hand always 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.550
 it must go in the clamping handle to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.500
 do any kind of maneuver 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.750
 raising or lowering the cabin first 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.480
 We will review our level of oil 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.629
 engine taking into account the two points 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.790
 inspection mark 2 in the rod 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.410
 Now let's check the oil level 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.840
 for our management system 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.000
 hydraulic this must be found between 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.560
 the two points of the minimum and maximum level 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.420
 taking into account that this inspection 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.820
 we will perform it when the engine is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.369
 cold check that the deposit always 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.039
 have your rubber protector to avoid 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.320
 that the oil is contaminated with water or 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.240
 waste land once made 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.490
 these checks we remove the pin from 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.899
 lock to lower the booth remember 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 that his left hand should go in the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.330
 clamping handle to perform this 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.330
 maneuver 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.310
 once anchored to the cabin we ensure 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.850
 the locking lever with its pin 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.850
 security 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 now we are going to perform the drainage of the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.689
 fuel trap loosening the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.049
 butterfly and letting out a minimum 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.520
 amount of acpm to release the water or 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.610
 the dirt contained within the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 gas 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.170
 followed the fuel trap 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.909
 we check the inspection points 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.090
 located in front of the cabin 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.090
 ah 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.860
 check that the liquid level 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.489
 Engine coolant is 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.640
 within the maximum and minimum points of 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.670
 marked in front of the deposit remember that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.530
 your engine use coolant 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.470
 original chinese which has a life 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.349
 useful 3 years also check the liquid 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.360
 used for the clutch system it 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.390
 finds within the maximum levels and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.670
 minimum and clean periodically 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.629
 air intake filters to the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.629
 interior of your cabin 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.050
 on the right side of the truck 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.990
 we found an indicator that informs us 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.670
 the condition of the engine air filter 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.220
 normally the band that we found is 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.920
 yellow if the band the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.660
 we found in red are signs of 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.290
 that we must perform maintenance and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.290
 cleaning the air filter then we're going to 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.360
 check the brake fluid that should be 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.470
 find within the minimum points and 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.310
 Mark 2 maximums in the deposit 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.200
 then 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.800
 we will make a drain in each of 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.800
 the cameras 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.390
 that are located in the part 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.360
 bottom of the air tank is 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.760
 advisable once a month to do the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.079
 adjustment of each of the bolts in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.079
 located on all the rims 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.140
 For your inspection it is important 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.240
 make a signal between the nut and the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.720
 ring 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.510
 to have a daily control of the state 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.220
 adjustment of each of the bolts for 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.140
 avoid fatigue when finishing our 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.720
 extensive trained work is 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.780
 important to locate the correct position 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.300
 of the rudder and the height and inclination of 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.030
 the chair 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.580
 before starting check the status of 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.520
 The following indicators level of 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.590
 fuel should not stay for less 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.199
 of a quarter tank 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.530
 engine temperature that normally 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.079
 it must work in the middle of the clock 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.060
 and the pressure controllers of 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.460
 air brake system that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.290
 normally they should be between the octave 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.810
 and the ninth line 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.880
 if during the operation a 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.670
 check yellow as check 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.650
 engine engine are symptoms of there 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.780
 a fault within the system 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.720
 injection but you can keep walking your 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.060
 vehicle without problem should approach 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.520
 an authorized praco didacol workshop for 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.470
 do your inspection later if 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.660
 On the contrary , a witness 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.030
 red are emergency signs 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.640
 and you must immediately stop your 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.460
 vehicle to review what is the cause 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.560
 of the problem 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.139
 keep in mind that these inspections 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.180
 should be done daily from this 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.099
 way you can control the correct 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 operation of your truck and its 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.620
 engine and thus prevent subsequent damage
