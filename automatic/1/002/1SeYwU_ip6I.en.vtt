00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:04.884
 I don't care what's on the calendar. 

00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:06.884
 The season starts today. 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.608
 This is the first spring day. 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.423
 What is it? 

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:17.330
 What the hell are you doing? 

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:18.800
 Roy? 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.715
 Put the gun down. 

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.970
 David, you made the right decision. 

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:30.665
 Would you mind seeing Bill? 

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:31.965
 Sure. What's happening? 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.827
 I don't know. He's somehow wrong. 

00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:35.423
 YOUR NEEDS 

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:37.315
 He worries unnecessarily. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.443
 I am fine. 

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:39.898
 Any plans for the weekend? 

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:42.555
 He worries unnecessarily. 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.720
 I am fine. 

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:45.525
 YOUR FRIENDS 

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:47.534
 Ben. 

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:49.359
 Ben. 

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:50.647
 YOUR FAMILY 

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:52.911
 What is Dad doing? 

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.333
 CHANGES 

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:56.602
 He has a knife. 

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.821
 What did you do? 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.957
 How long has he been playing the statue? 

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:10.875
 A couple of hours. 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.242
 Neither does it move. 

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.418
 NO SIGNAL 

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:20.981
 We have a problem. 

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:22.275
 Is dead? 

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.024
 David, someone's out. 

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:31.200
 The army began shooting the inhabitants. 

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.029
 We gotta get out, guys! 

00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:52.548
 THIS 

00:01:56.047 --> 00:01:57.133
 IS ONLY 

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:58.361
 He caught it. 

00:01:58.396 --> 00:01:59.443
 You can not know that. 

00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:01.086
 Don't worry. I'm not sick. 

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.675
 BEGINNING 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.894
 My God. 

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:20.255
