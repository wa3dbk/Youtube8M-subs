day on how to remove bugs and I'm I
first<00:00:07.529> heard<00:00:07.710> about<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.040> was<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.250> little

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
first heard about I was a little

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
first heard about I was a little
reluctant<00:00:08.700> actually<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.510> didn't<00:00:09.960> believe<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.380> I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
reluctant actually I didn't believe it I

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
reluctant actually I didn't believe it I
thought<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.679> was<00:00:10.800> was<00:00:11.160> BS<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.090> actually

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
thought it was was BS but I actually

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.749 
thought it was was BS but I actually
tried<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:13.650> impressed<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.730> I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
tried it and I was impressed so I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.740 
tried it and I was impressed so I
thought<00:00:15.059> I'd<00:00:15.179> share<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> our

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750

thought I'd share with some of our
buddies<00:00:16.049> out<00:00:16.170> there<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.980> I'm<00:00:17.190> sure<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> lot<00:00:17.550> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
buddies out there and I'm sure a lot of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you guys already know about this but

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.730 
you guys already know about this but
what<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.369> told<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.760> user<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.590> what<00:00:22.590> they

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
what I was told is user are what they

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
what I was told is user are what they
call<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> dry<00:00:23.279> cleaner<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.880> sheep<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.800> could<00:00:25.949> be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
call a dry cleaner a sheep it could be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.349 
call a dry cleaner a sheep it could be
centered<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.490> Senate<00:00:26.849> doesn't<00:00:27.000> matter<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
centered on Senate doesn't matter I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.609 
centered on Senate doesn't matter I
believe<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> chemical<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
believe it's the chemical in it that

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.519 
believe it's the chemical in it that
actually<00:00:29.660> causes<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> effect<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.320> you're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
actually causes the effect that you're

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.100 
actually causes the effect that you're
about<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.969> what<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> I'll<00:00:33.750> go

about to see what you do is I'll go
ahead<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.380> soak<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.040> want<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.430> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
ahead and soak there you want to do you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.000 
ahead and soak there you want to do you
want<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:36.510> ahead<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> clean<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.860> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
want to go ahead and clean up and you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.150 
want to go ahead and clean up and you
can<00:00:38.160> see<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:39.079> thick<00:00:40.079> come<00:00:40.770> closer

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
can see this is really thick come closer

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
can see this is really thick come closer
look<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:41.760> thicknesses<00:00:42.350> you're<00:00:43.350> close<00:00:44.510> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
look out thicknesses you're close it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.560 
look out thicknesses you're close it's
pretty<00:00:45.719> uh<00:00:45.780> pretty<00:00:46.110> thick<00:00:46.500> huh

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
pretty uh pretty thick huh

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.850 
pretty uh pretty thick huh
you<00:00:48.570> go<00:00:48.750> ahead<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.989> soak<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.800> couple

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you go ahead and soak it down a couple

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.209 
you go ahead and soak it down a couple
of<00:00:50.190> minutes<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.739> ahead<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:52.980> wet<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of minutes and go ahead and wet the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.139 
of minutes and go ahead and wet the
sheet<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:55.260> dryer<00:00:55.469> sheet

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
sheet a little bit a little dryer sheet

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.590 
sheet a little bit a little dryer sheet
and<00:00:57.649> start<00:00:58.649> working<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.539> into<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and start working into them into the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.369 
and start working into them into the
spots<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:03.000> chemical<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
spots and a chemical actually do all the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.550 
spots and a chemical actually do all the
work

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.050 

it's<00:01:08.560> almost<00:01:08.800> off<00:01:09.280> it's<00:01:09.850> almost

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
it's almost off it's almost

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.990 
it's almost off it's almost
instantaneous<00:01:10.630> but<00:01:11.440> uh<00:01:11.640> cookie<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.760> put<00:01:12.970> a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
instantaneous but uh cookie I put a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:29.020 
instantaneous but uh cookie I put a
little<00:01:13.210> elbow<00:01:13.480> grease<00:01:13.660> into<00:01:14.260> it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.020 

just<00:01:29.570> keep<00:01:29.749> working<00:01:29.960> around<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:31.700> can<00:01:31.850> see

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
just keep working around you can see

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.399 
just keep working around you can see
something's<00:01:32.420> releasing<00:01:32.899> from<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.049> sheet

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
something's releasing from the sheet

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.550 
something's releasing from the sheet
it's<00:01:34.399> obviously<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> chemical<00:01:35.539> I'm<00:01:36.109> sure<00:01:36.319> it

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's obviously the chemical I'm sure it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.190 
it's obviously the chemical I'm sure it
is<00:01:36.850> anybody<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:37.969> there<00:01:38.000> just<00:01:38.420> going<00:01:38.600> post<00:01:38.990> if
