and I want to remove the antenna wire

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.669 
and I want to remove the antenna wire
this<00:00:20.239> is<00:00:20.419> what<00:00:20.919> serves<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.279> row<00:00:22.939> locking<00:00:23.679> so

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
this is what serves the row locking so

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.749 
this is what serves the row locking so
first<00:00:24.890> off<00:00:25.099> you<00:00:25.130> have<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.399> look<00:00:25.550> at<00:00:25.699> the

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
first off you have to look at the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.880 
first off you have to look at the
connector<00:00:26.149> and<00:00:26.179> if<00:00:26.449> you<00:00:26.569> see<00:00:26.749> a<00:00:26.779> purple<00:00:27.140> tab

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
connector and if you see a purple tab

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.749 
connector and if you see a purple tab
like<00:00:28.249> this

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
like this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.160 
like this
that's<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.720> locking<00:00:30.529> tab<00:00:30.739> and<00:00:31.570> one<00:00:32.570> way<00:00:32.719> or<00:00:33.019> the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
that's a locking tab and one way or the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.799 
that's a locking tab and one way or the
other<00:00:33.260> it's<00:00:33.590> going<00:00:33.769> to<00:00:33.829> push<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:35.660> will

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
other it's going to push and it will

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.669 
other it's going to push and it will
click<00:00:36.309> when<00:00:37.309> it<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.550> unlocked<00:00:38.170> if<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.379> do<00:00:39.559> not

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
click when it is unlocked if you do not

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.340 
click when it is unlocked if you do not
move<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.160> locking<00:00:40.550> tab<00:00:40.789> you<00:00:41.780> will<00:00:41.929> not<00:00:42.079> be

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
move the locking tab you will not be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:51.779 
move the locking tab you will not be
able<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:43.539> get<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:44.719> pins<00:00:44.989> out<00:00:46.390> see<00:00:47.390> if<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:47.570> can

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.950 

sometimes<00:00:52.789> it's<00:00:52.969> hard<00:00:53.179> to<00:00:53.269> see<00:00:53.570> which<00:00:53.719> way

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
sometimes it's hard to see which way

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.310 
sometimes it's hard to see which way
these<00:00:54.140> things<00:00:54.409> move<00:00:55.089> okay<00:00:56.089> this<00:00:56.269> one<00:00:56.480> has

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.249 
fat one and a thin one for these
connectors<00:01:32.420> we're<00:01:32.600> going<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:32.810> use<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.049> thin

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
connectors we're going to use the thin

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.529 
connectors we're going to use the thin
ones<00:01:33.909> then<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.000> got<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.180> look<00:01:35.360> at<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
ones then you got a look at the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.789 
ones then you got a look at the
connector<00:01:37.689> let's<00:01:38.689> see<00:01:38.930> which<00:01:39.110> pins<00:01:39.469> is<00:01:39.649> it

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
connector let's see which pins is it

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.429 
connector let's see which pins is it
these<00:01:40.039> two<00:01:40.329> you'll<00:01:41.329> notice<00:01:42.939> that<00:01:44.259> there<00:01:45.259> are

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
these two you'll notice that there are

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.340 
these two you'll notice that there are
these<00:01:45.469> little<00:01:46.299> slots<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.840> don't<00:01:48.079> know<00:01:48.170> if<00:01:48.259> you

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
these little slots I don't know if you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.830 
these little slots I don't know if you
can<00:01:48.439> see<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.859> or<00:01:49.039> not<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:50.090> if<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:50.450> stick<00:01:50.719> the

can see that or not but if you stick the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.370 
can see that or not but if you stick the
tool<00:01:51.049> in

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.290 

you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.680> pull<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> wire<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:59.180> have<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
you can just pull the wire out I have to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.870 
you can just pull the wire out I have to
say<00:02:00.480> this<00:02:00.720> tool<00:02:01.020> Oh<00:02:01.400> for<00:02:02.400> this<00:02:02.460> one<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.670> need<00:02:02.760> the

bigger tool where to put it well anyway

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.300 
bigger tool where to put it well anyway
on<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.979> connector<00:02:09.619> there<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:12.470> little<00:02:13.470> tiny

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
on this connector there are little tiny

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.210 
on this connector there are little tiny
tiny<00:02:14.970> locking<00:02:15.930> tabs<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.740> don't<00:02:16.890> know<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.130> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
tiny locking tabs I don't know if you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.640 
tiny locking tabs I don't know if you
can<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.580> them<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.720> they're<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.020> each<00:02:19.320> side

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
can see them but they're on each side

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.820 
can see them but they're on each side
and<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:19.980> need<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.250> press<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.670> tool<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.650> goes<00:02:22.650> in

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and we need to press the tool in goes in

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
and we need to press the tool in goes in
there<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.350> forces<00:02:25.350> those<00:02:25.500> tabs

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
there like this and forces those tabs

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.610 
there like this and forces those tabs
down<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:27.410> then<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:30.739> easily<00:02:32.390> sometimes

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
down and then you can easily sometimes
