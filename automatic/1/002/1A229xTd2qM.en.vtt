00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:22.949
 unboxing to samsung galaxy s 5 color 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 that we have chosen has been the golden 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.160
 but anyway this cell phone is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.279
 available in blue white black and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.210
 the one that I'm going to show you the golden 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.210
 we proceed to open this device 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.390
 first the plastic that brings the box of the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 cellular factory 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 ah 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.989
 and then the plastic that includes the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.329
 company where we have bought it has already 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.329
 cut the plastic open the box 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.979
 and we remove the cell phone as we can see 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.790
 this cell phone is golden on the back and black 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 forward 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.899
 it includes the manuals and instructions 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.909
 and some information cards 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.909
 compatible samsung devices 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.219
 more documentation 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.820
 of course the battery of 2800 thousand years 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 ah 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.200
 the power adapter 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:12.780
 and the usb cable in this case have given us 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.970
 normal and they have not given us the 3.0 but 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.920
 Anyway, we can load 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.400
 normal way our device with 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.400
 this cable 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.069
 the typical samsung hearing aids but 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.069
 with controls to raise and lower volume 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.070
 and finally the pads that 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.840
 adjust to the size of your ear we're going to 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.080
 remove the plastics that this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080
 mobile 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.880
 here we have the 3.0 entry that also 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.610
 has his older brother the know 3 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.660
 here we are left alone with the battery 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.660
 to insert it 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.050
 when we remove the cover this cell phone 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.180
 we can notice that it has this protection 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.100
 so that the water does not enter thanks to the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.100
 ip67 certification 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.860
 and we have already turned on this device 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.200
 for the first time to see it more closely 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.650
 The first thing we see is a great 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.550
 5.1-inch screen with a 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.640
 resolution fully 1080 has 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.590
 a front camera of 2.1 megapixels and 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.250
 a 16 megapixel rear camera 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.410
 able to record at 4k and finally we 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.230
 some speakers in the back that in 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.060
 my opinion are pretty good other 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.510
 What I want to emphasize is that this 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.010
 phone has the ip67 certification that 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.290
 it tells us that our cell phone is 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.860
 resistant to water and dust 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.860
