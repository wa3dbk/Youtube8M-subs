00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.490 
basically we're interested in form that
is<00:00:29.130> generated<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.050> start<00:00:31.349> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
is generated so that we start with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
is generated so that we start with
simple<00:00:31.679> ideas<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.669> grow<00:00:32.880> into

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
simple ideas and they grow into

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
simple ideas and they grow into
something<00:00:33.270> complex<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.140> you'll<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.440> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
something complex and you'll see that

study<00:03:54.969> on<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.150> house<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.629> how<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.049> have<00:03:56.260> an

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:56.499 
study on a house and how you can have an

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.280 
study on a house and how you can have an
infinite<00:03:56.950> variety<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.840> spatial<00:03:58.840> arrangement

infinite variety of spatial arrangement

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.009

so<00:03:59.409> you<00:03:59.469> have<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.760> variable<00:04:00.760> plan<00:04:01.239> variable

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
so you have a variable plan variable

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.110 
so you have a variable plan variable
session<00:04:02.469> and<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.680> variable<00:04:03.040> program<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.060> you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
session and a variable program so you

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.720 
session and a variable program so you
get<00:04:04.239> something<00:04:04.450> like<00:04:04.599> 300<00:04:05.079> million

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
get something like 300 million

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.520
