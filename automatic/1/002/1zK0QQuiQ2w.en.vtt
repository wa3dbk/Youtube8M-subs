00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.030 

so<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.110> first<00:00:01.319> thing<00:00:01.500> you<00:00:01.589> got<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.740> do<00:00:01.920> is

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
so the first thing you got to do is

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.610 
so the first thing you got to do is
loosen<00:00:02.220> up<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.520> pinch<00:00:02.760> bolt<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.210> that's<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.720> 17

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
loosen up the pinch bolt and that's a 17

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:17.599 
loosen up the pinch bolt and that's a 17
millimeter<00:00:04.920> socket<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:16.400> then<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.520> your

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
millimeter socket and then in your

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
millimeter socket and then in your
triumph<00:00:18.029> toolkit<00:00:18.630> you'll<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> C<00:00:19.350> spanner

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
triumph toolkit you'll have a C spanner

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
triumph toolkit you'll have a C spanner
and<00:00:20.070> an<00:00:20.130> extension<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> used<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and an extension and this is used to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.609 
and an extension and this is used to
adjust<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.670> eccentric<00:00:23.670> adjuster<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> can

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
adjust the eccentric adjuster so you can

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:45.440 
adjust the eccentric adjuster so you can
loosen<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.010> chain<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:43.910> here<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.969> decided<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
loosen the chain up here I decided to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.940 
loosen the chain up here I decided to
put<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> pitbull<00:00:46.379> stand<00:00:46.710> just

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
put it up on the pitbull stand just

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.290 
put it up on the pitbull stand just
because<00:00:47.100> it'd<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.280> easier<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> rotate<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because it'd be easier to rotate the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.709 
because it'd be easier to rotate the
wheel<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> sprocket<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> now

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
wheel to get the sprocket off and now

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.950 
wheel to get the sprocket off and now
grab<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> six<00:00:52.680> millimeter<00:00:53.010> hex<00:00:54.000> wrench<00:00:54.329> or

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
grab a six millimeter hex wrench or

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
grab a six millimeter hex wrench or
allen<00:00:55.230> wrench<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:55.829> call<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.820> 12

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
allen wrench as they call them and a 12

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
allen wrench as they call them and a 12
millimeter<00:00:57.660> socket<00:00:58.620> wrench<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.460> should

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
millimeter socket wrench and you should

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.849 
millimeter socket wrench and you should
be<00:00:59.760> able<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.320> remove<00:01:01.320> these<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> recommend

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
be able to remove these I recommend

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
be able to remove these I recommend
loosening<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> stand

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
loosening them when it's not on a stand

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
loosening them when it's not on a stand
first<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.640> easier<00:01:06.000> because

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
first just because it's easier because

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
first just because it's easier because
the<00:01:06.420> wheel<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:07.200> spin<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.010> in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the wheel will spin because it's in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
the wheel will spin because it's in
neutral

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.380 

here<00:01:25.930> removing<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.440> guard<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.310> 30<00:01:27.700> T<00:01:27.970> Torx

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
here removing the guard with a 30 T Torx

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.100 
here removing the guard with a 30 T Torx
wrench<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:29.440> should<00:01:29.800> have<00:01:29.890> done<00:01:30.040> this<00:01:30.220> before<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
wrench I should have done this before it

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
wrench I should have done this before it
would<00:01:32.230> have<00:01:32.320> been<00:01:32.410> easier<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.740> remove<00:01:32.950> the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
would have been easier to remove the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.860 
would have been easier to remove the
sprocket<00:01:33.580> with<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:33.910> chain<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.420> probably<00:01:34.810> a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
sprocket with the chain and probably a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.510 
sprocket with the chain and probably a
better<00:01:35.050> idea<00:01:35.200> overall<00:01:35.770> for<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.250> health<00:01:36.430> of

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
better idea overall for the health of

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.240 
better idea overall for the health of
the<00:01:36.610> chain<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:36.850> would<00:01:37.000> imagine<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.590> did<00:01:39.130> this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
the chain I would imagine so I did this

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.650 
the chain I would imagine so I did this
at<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:39.610> point<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.940> time<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:40.180> should<00:01:40.420> have<00:01:40.540> done

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
at this point in time I should have done

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.760 
at this point in time I should have done
it<00:01:40.780> as<00:01:40.870> you'll<00:01:41.020> see<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.380> reassembly

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
it as you'll see in the reassembly

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.630 
it as you'll see in the reassembly
another<00:01:42.730> way<00:01:46.800> as<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:47.920> mentioned<00:01:48.190> before<00:01:48.250> here

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
another way as I mentioned before here

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.890 
another way as I mentioned before here
I'm<00:01:48.760> going<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.940> put<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.210> sprocket<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.780> the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
I'm going to put the sprocket in the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.870 
I'm going to put the sprocket in the
chain<00:01:50.140> first<00:01:50.500> before<00:01:50.740> putting<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.460> on<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.700> hub

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
chain first before putting it on the hub

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.060 
chain first before putting it on the hub
it's<00:01:52.210> just<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.930> lot<00:01:53.080> easier<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.500> fit<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.830> chain

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
it's just a lot easier to fit the chain

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.400 
it's just a lot easier to fit the chain
this<00:01:54.220> way<00:01:54.400> with<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.730> bigger<00:01:54.910> sprocket<00:01:55.450> I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
this way with the bigger sprocket I

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.860 
this way with the bigger sprocket I
suggest<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.370> same<00:01:57.610> method<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.030> removal<00:01:58.660> as

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
suggest the same method for removal as

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:50.040 
suggest the same method for removal as
well

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.750 

now<00:02:51.050> I'm<00:02:51.110> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.290> torque<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.830> six<00:02:52.129> sprocket

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
now I'm going to torque the six sprocket

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.030 
now I'm going to torque the six sprocket
bolts<00:02:53.150> 233<00:02:54.140> Newton<00:02:54.410> meters<00:02:54.650> which<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.920> about

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
bolts 233 Newton meters which is about

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.300 
bolts 233 Newton meters which is about
twenty<00:02:55.370> four<00:02:55.550> point<00:02:55.760> four<00:02:56.090> foot-pounds<00:02:56.870> I

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
twenty four point four foot-pounds I

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.619 
twenty four point four foot-pounds I
recommend<00:02:58.310> doing<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.670> an<00:02:58.760> offset<00:02:59.209> form

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
recommend doing it an offset form

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.210 
recommend doing it an offset form
similar<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.050> when<00:03:00.319> you're<00:03:00.440> installing<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.190> new

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
similar to when you're installing a new

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.070 
similar to when you're installing a new
wheel<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> car<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.930> it's

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
wheel on a car just so that it's

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.390 
wheel on a car just so that it's
distributed<00:03:03.650> evenly<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.190> you're<00:03:04.280> not

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
distributed evenly and you're not

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:17.080 
distributed evenly and you're not
tweaking<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.510> side<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.959> sprocket<00:03:16.090> and

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
tweaking one side of the sprocket and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.400 
tweaking one side of the sprocket and
here<00:03:17.269> I'm<00:03:17.360> doing<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.599> reverse<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
here I'm doing the reverse with the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.920 
here I'm doing the reverse with the
eccentric<00:03:19.099> adjuster<00:03:19.670> with<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.420> C<00:03:20.599> spanner

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
eccentric adjuster with the C spanner

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.690 
eccentric adjuster with the C spanner
and<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.319> extension<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.040> tighten<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.459> chain

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
and the extension to tighten the chain

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.539 
and the extension to tighten the chain
back<00:03:22.880> up<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:24.230> get<00:03:24.380> about<00:03:24.560> twenty<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.310> thirty

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
back up to get about twenty to thirty

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.100 
back up to get about twenty to thirty
millimeters<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.269> play<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.769> chain<00:03:29.110> it

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
millimeters of play in the chain it
