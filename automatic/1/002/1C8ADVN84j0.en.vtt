00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.360 
Excalibur I'm happy about that one too I
really<00:02:25.519> figured<00:02:25.909> that<00:02:26.360> would<00:02:26.480> be<00:02:26.659> a<00:02:27.069> AC<00:02:28.069> career

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
really figured that would be a AC career

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.699 
really figured that would be a AC career
at<00:02:29.299> first<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.049> would<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.290> figured<00:02:30.590> it'd<00:02:30.680> be

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
at first and it would I figured it'd be

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.759 
at first and it would I figured it'd be
that<00:02:30.829> only<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> lake<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:32.530> dry<00:02:33.530> guard

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
that only to the lake and a dry guard

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.589 
that only to the lake and a dry guard
which<00:02:34.129> is<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.400> know<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.700> other<00:02:34.879> one<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
which is you know that other one of the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.170 
which is you know that other one of the
ocg<00:02:36.200> imports<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.920> course<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.579> had<00:02:37.819> different

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
ocg imports of course it had different

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.780 
ocg imports of course it had different
names<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:38.569> that's<00:02:38.989> getting<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.620> kid<00:02:40.489> moto

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790

good news for numbers collectors out

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.920 
good news for numbers collectors out
there<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.459> was<00:02:58.609> wondering<00:02:59.000> what<00:02:59.629> writing<00:02:59.810> this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
there I was wondering what writing this

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.539 
there I was wondering what writing this
would<00:03:00.079> be<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.440> they<00:03:00.890> were<00:03:00.980> how<00:03:01.099> ready<00:03:01.400> for

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
would be and they were how ready for

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.670 
would be and they were how ready for
Japan<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> guess<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.599> get<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> break<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.470> few

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
Japan so I guess we get a break on a few

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.520 
Japan so I guess we get a break on a few
cards<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.459> would<00:03:05.150> rather<00:03:05.239> have<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.409> was

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
cards I would rather have the what was

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.990 
cards I would rather have the what was
it<00:03:06.560> rare<00:03:06.859> or<00:03:07.040> common<00:03:07.370> mistake<00:03:07.700> i<00:03:07.730> think<00:03:07.879> it<00:03:07.940> was

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
it rare or common mistake i think it was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.250 
it rare or common mistake i think it was
rare<00:03:08.239> for<00:03:08.269> japan<00:03:08.629> after<00:03:08.750> they<00:03:08.959> had<00:03:09.079> that

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
rare for japan after they had that

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.259 
rare for japan after they had that
obviously<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:09.980> i<00:03:10.159> guess<00:03:10.549> we'll<00:03:10.700> take<00:03:10.849> one<00:03:11.030> gap

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
obviously but i guess we'll take one gap

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.460 
obviously but i guess we'll take one gap
so<00:03:11.780> yeah<00:03:11.870> tell<00:03:12.049> me<00:03:12.109> what<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.319> guys<00:03:12.409> think
