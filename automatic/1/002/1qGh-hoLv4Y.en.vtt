00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
playing some of the story in the game so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.300 
playing some of the story in the game so
now<00:02:21.940> let's<00:02:22.450> look<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.959> cons<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.890> story

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
now let's look at the cons of the story

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.970 
now let's look at the cons of the story
the<00:02:24.850> missions<00:02:25.270> first<00:02:25.810> off<00:02:26.110> they're<00:02:26.500> really

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the missions first off they're really

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.260 
the missions first off they're really
repetitive<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.989> first<00:02:29.459> 10<00:02:30.459> missions

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
repetitive and for the first 10 missions

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.670 
repetitive and for the first 10 missions
with<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.260> tree<00:02:32.500> jumping<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.160> battles<00:02:33.820> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
with the tree jumping and battles and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.130 
with the tree jumping and battles and
etc<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.670> pretty<00:02:36.940> much<00:02:37.090> gets<00:02:37.540> boring<00:02:37.989> after

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
etc but it pretty much gets boring after

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.610 
etc but it pretty much gets boring after
a<00:02:38.470> while<00:02:38.590> seeing<00:02:39.580> as<00:02:39.850> they<00:02:40.600> don't<00:02:40.900> offer<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.290> lot

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
a while seeing as they don't offer a lot

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.960 
a while seeing as they don't offer a lot
of<00:02:41.970> variety<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:44.230> mission<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.280> enough

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
of variety in the mission and enough

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.390 
of variety in the mission and enough
with<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.330> story<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:47.110> let's<00:02:47.739> get<00:02:47.950> down<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.250> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
with the story so let's get down to the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:03:02.140 
with the story so let's get down to the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.030 

the<00:03:14.630> multiplayer<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:15.530> game<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:15.890> my

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
the multiplayer of this game in my

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.190 
the multiplayer of this game in my
opinion<00:03:16.400> was<00:03:16.700> probably<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.360> best<00:03:17.599> mode<00:03:17.870> that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
opinion was probably the best mode that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.530 
opinion was probably the best mode that
I<00:03:18.260> enjoyed<00:03:18.890> with<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.340> game<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:20.180> camera

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
I enjoyed with this game the camera

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.360 
I enjoyed with this game the camera
angle<00:03:20.599> was<00:03:21.319> well<00:03:21.590> made<00:03:21.830> with<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
angle was well made with the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.270 
angle was well made with the
over-the-shoulder<00:03:23.830> experience<00:03:24.830> which

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
over-the-shoulder experience which

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.010 
over-the-shoulder experience which
hasn't<00:03:25.520> really<00:03:25.910> been<00:03:26.060> used<00:03:26.390> in<00:03:26.569> fighting

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
hasn't really been used in fighting

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.199 
hasn't really been used in fighting
games<00:03:27.050> often<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.400> was<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.580> really<00:03:28.910> great

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
games often and it was a really great

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.390 
games often and it was a really great
way<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.600> show<00:03:30.020> off<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.440> intensive<00:03:31.040> ninja

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
way to show off the intensive ninja

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.430 
way to show off the intensive ninja
jutsus<00:03:31.850> embattled<00:03:32.270> was<00:03:32.720> pummeling<00:03:33.260> your

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
jutsus embattled was pummeling your

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.340 
jutsus embattled was pummeling your
opponent<00:03:33.980> down<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.459> ground<00:03:35.350> basically

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
opponent down to the ground basically

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.840 
opponent down to the ground basically
with<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.530> multiplayer<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.520> see<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.819> what

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
with the multiplayer all you see is what

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.720 
with the multiplayer all you see is what
you<00:03:38.120> get<00:03:38.420> with<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> 25<00:03:39.500> character<00:03:40.100> roster<00:03:40.250> and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
you get with the 25 character roster and

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.059 
you get with the 25 character roster and
the<00:03:41.390> added<00:03:41.690> support<00:03:41.870> characters<00:03:42.650> which<00:03:42.920> is<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
the added support characters which is a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.190 
the added support characters which is a
shame<00:03:43.190> because<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.120> expecting<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.989> have

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
shame because I was expecting to have

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.680 
shame because I was expecting to have
them<00:03:45.410> as<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.620> full<00:03:46.550> proper<00:03:46.940> character<00:03:47.480> instead

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
them as a full proper character instead

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.840 
them as a full proper character instead
of<00:03:47.930> having<00:03:48.140> them<00:03:48.560> as<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.769> support<00:03:49.610> character

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
of having them as a support character

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.960 
of having them as a support character
it's<00:03:50.780> just<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.290> they<00:03:51.530> could<00:03:52.010> make<00:03:52.459> them<00:03:52.670> into

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
it's just that they could make them into

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.880 
it's just that they could make them into
characters<00:03:53.510> they're<00:03:53.690> just<00:03:53.870> being<00:03:54.110> quite<00:03:54.560> lazy

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
characters they're just being quite lazy

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.710 
characters they're just being quite lazy
and<00:03:55.250> think<00:03:55.549> they<00:03:55.700> can<00:03:55.730> just<00:03:55.880> get<00:03:56.180> away<00:03:56.450> with

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
and think they can just get away with

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.410 
and think they can just get away with
having<00:03:57.110> them<00:03:57.440> as<00:03:57.590> support<00:03:58.190> then<00:03:59.030> there's<00:03:59.330> a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
having them as support then there's a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.420 
having them as support then there's a
new<00:03:59.959> thing<00:04:00.319> that<00:04:00.470> was<00:04:00.739> added<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.250> game

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
new thing that was added to the game

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.610 
but to be honest is all about the
ability<00:04:34.070> of<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:35.060> weight<00:04:35.330> of<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.960> awakening

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
ability of the weight of the awakening

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.540 
ability of the weight of the awakening
because<00:04:37.030> they<00:04:38.030> all<00:04:38.210> work<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.660> different<00:04:38.780> ways

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
because they all work in different ways

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.770 
because they all work in different ways
another<00:04:40.550> thing<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.940> would<00:04:41.060> like<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.240> point<00:04:41.570> out

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
another thing I would like to point out

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.230 
another thing I would like to point out
is<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:42.680> need<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:42.950> make<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.820> combo<00:04:44.180> is

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
is that they need to make the combo is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.290 
is that they need to make the combo is
more<00:04:44.600> in-depth<00:04:45.169> instead<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.860> just<00:04:46.160> having<00:04:47.000> to

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
more in-depth instead of just having to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.330 
more in-depth instead of just having to
match<00:04:47.479> Circle<00:04:48.140> Circle<00:04:48.320> Circle<00:04:48.530> up<00:04:49.039> Circle

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
match Circle Circle Circle up Circle

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.500 
match Circle Circle Circle up Circle
right<00:04:50.180> circle<00:04:50.750> left<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.380> circle<00:04:51.620> down

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
right circle left and circle down

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.950 
right circle left and circle down
just<00:04:53.260> plain<00:04:53.470> circle<00:04:54.450> evasion<00:04:55.450> really<00:04:55.630> put

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
just plain circle evasion really put

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.950 
just plain circle evasion really put
more<00:04:56.230> moves<00:04:57.190> in<00:04:57.520> which<00:04:58.270> will<00:04:58.480> make<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.750> game

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
more moves in which will make the game

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.980 
more moves in which will make the game
more<00:04:59.250> harder<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.430> master<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.270> which<00:05:01.720> would<00:05:01.930> be

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
more harder to master and which would be

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.950 
more harder to master and which would be
more<00:05:02.620> of<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.830> challenge<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:04.210> only<00:05:04.390> downside<00:05:04.660> is

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
more of a challenge the only downside is

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.200 
more of a challenge the only downside is
of<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.500> multiplayer<00:05:05.980> sadly<00:05:06.520> that<00:05:06.730> there<00:05:06.970> is

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
of the multiplayer sadly that there is

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.200 
of the multiplayer sadly that there is
no<00:05:07.510> online<00:05:07.900> mode<00:05:08.830> which<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.220> just<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.790> kick<00:05:10.030> in

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
no online mode which is just a kick in

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.440 
no online mode which is just a kick in
the<00:05:10.240> arse<00:05:10.570> as<00:05:10.990> it's<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.130> next<00:05:12.490> generation<00:05:13.270> in

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
the arse as it's the next generation in

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.740 
the arse as it's the next generation in
gaming<00:05:14.020> they<00:05:14.620> should<00:05:15.070> put<00:05:15.460> an<00:05:15.640> online<00:05:16.210> mode

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
gaming they should put an online mode

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.990 
gaming they should put an online mode
despite<00:05:17.350> that<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.830> story<00:05:18.100> mode<00:05:18.400> isn't<00:05:18.610> that

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
despite that the story mode isn't that

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.600 
despite that the story mode isn't that
good<00:05:19.420> that<00:05:19.810> online<00:05:19.960> mode<00:05:20.440> could<00:05:20.860> have<00:05:21.010> truly

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
good that online mode could have truly

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.840 
good that online mode could have truly
made<00:05:21.820> it<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.450> best<00:05:23.110> Naruto<00:05:23.770> game<00:05:24.010> made<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.580> far

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
think that you're watching it I think

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.010 
think that you're watching it I think
all<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.430> naruto<00:05:54.850> game<00:05:55.060> should<00:05:55.330> stick<00:05:55.720> to

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
all the naruto game should stick to

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.500 
all the naruto game should stick to
these<00:05:56.170> graphics<00:05:56.980> they're<00:05:57.250> perfect<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.360> way

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
these graphics they're perfect the way

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.000 
these graphics they're perfect the way
they<00:05:58.540> are<00:05:58.750> they<00:05:59.080> don't<00:05:59.290> need<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.590> be<00:05:59.710> improved

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
they are they don't need to be improved

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.190 
they are they don't need to be improved
any<00:06:00.310> more<00:06:00.610> i<00:06:00.640> think<00:06:00.820> these<00:06:01.330> graphics<00:06:01.870> should

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
any more i think these graphics should

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.710 
any more i think these graphics should
last<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.770> long<00:06:02.980> time<00:06:03.420> considering<00:06:04.420> the<00:06:04.540> amount

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
last a long time considering the amount

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.650 
last a long time considering the amount
of<00:06:04.870> detail<00:06:05.410> they<00:06:05.620> put<00:06:05.650> into<00:06:06.030> these<00:06:07.030> graphics

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
of detail they put into these graphics

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.880 
of detail they put into these graphics
and<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.280> jutsus<00:06:09.280> look<00:06:09.550> more<00:06:09.910> real<00:06:10.180> than<00:06:10.450> ever

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
and the jutsus look more real than ever

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.060 
and the jutsus look more real than ever
so<00:06:11.890> now<00:06:12.340> it's<00:06:12.670> time<00:06:13.000> for<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.330> verdict<00:06:14.070> overall

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
so now it's time for the verdict overall

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.550 
so now it's time for the verdict overall
this<00:06:15.250> game<00:06:15.550> is<00:06:15.760> okay<00:06:16.150> in<00:06:16.210> my<00:06:16.480> opinion<00:06:16.870> not<00:06:17.230> the

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
this game is okay in my opinion not the

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.130 
this game is okay in my opinion not the
best<00:06:17.800> naruto<00:06:18.460> game<00:06:18.880> after<00:06:19.390> all<00:06:19.420> due<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:19.990> the

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
best naruto game after all due to the

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.230 
best naruto game after all due to the
lack<00:06:20.380> of<00:06:20.440> thought<00:06:21.100> into<00:06:21.370> making<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.970> story

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
lack of thought into making the story

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.810 
lack of thought into making the story
road<00:06:22.510> into<00:06:22.930> an<00:06:23.490> RPG<00:06:24.490> style<00:06:25.180> wiper<00:06:25.650> 360<00:06:26.650> version

road into an RPG style wiper 360 version

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.320 
road into an RPG style wiper 360 version
