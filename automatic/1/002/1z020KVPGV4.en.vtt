more active as the week progresses might
be<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.849> good<00:00:29.060> idea<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.450> peek<00:00:29.840> at<00:00:29.989> those<00:00:30.140> cameras

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
be a good idea to peek at those cameras

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.620 
be a good idea to peek at those cameras
while<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.829> talk<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.910> make<00:00:32.029> sure<00:00:32.180> everyone's<00:00:32.509> in

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
while I talk to make sure everyone's in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.260 
while I talk to make sure everyone's in
their<00:00:32.720> proper<00:00:33.020> place<00:00:33.550> interestingly<00:00:34.550> enough

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
their proper place interestingly enough

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.210 
their proper place interestingly enough
Freddie<00:00:35.750> you<00:00:36.200> doesn't<00:00:36.530> usually<00:00:36.620> come<00:00:36.980> off<00:00:37.100> the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
Freddie you doesn't usually come off the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.850 
Freddie you doesn't usually come off the
stage<00:00:37.460> very<00:00:37.850> often<00:00:38.330> you<00:00:39.080> become<00:00:39.380> this<00:00:39.530> more

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
stage very often you become this more

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.610 
stage very often you become this more
active<00:00:40.280> in<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.490> dark<00:00:40.760> though<00:00:41.060> I<00:00:41.390> guess<00:00:42.380> that's

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
active in the dark though I guess that's

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.260 
active in the dark though I guess that's
one<00:00:43.040> more<00:00:43.190> reason<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.670> not<00:00:43.820> run<00:00:43.970> out<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.120> power

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
one more reason to not run out of power

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.410 
one more reason to not run out of power
right<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:45.400> also<00:00:46.400> want<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.730> emphasize<00:00:46.880> the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
right I also want to emphasize the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.090 
right I also want to emphasize the
importance<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:47.960> using<00:00:48.140> your<00:00:48.410> door<00:00:48.710> lights

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
importance of using your door lights

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.760 
importance of using your door lights
there<00:00:50.090> are<00:00:50.240> blind<00:00:50.630> spots<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.320> camera<00:00:51.740> view

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
there are blind spots in the camera view

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.060 
there are blind spots in the camera view
and<00:00:52.220> those<00:00:53.030> blind<00:00:53.480> spots<00:00:53.650> happen<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.710> be<00:00:54.830> right

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
and those blind spots happen to be right

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.270 
and those blind spots happen to be right
outside<00:00:55.220> your<00:00:55.490> doors<00:00:56.290> so<00:00:57.290> if<00:00:57.650> you<00:00:57.829> can't<00:00:58.040> find

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
outside your doors so if you can't find

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.350 
outside your doors so if you can't find
something<00:00:58.670> or<00:00:59.500> someone<00:01:00.500> on<00:01:01.010> your<00:01:01.070> cameras<00:01:01.700> be

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
sure to check those door lights you

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.840 
sure to check those door lights you
might<00:01:05.239> only<00:01:05.390> have<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.600> few<00:01:05.869> seconds<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.380> react

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
might only have a few seconds to react

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.219 
might only have a few seconds to react
not<00:01:07.850> likely<00:01:08.060> be<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:08.329> any<00:01:08.420> danger<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.899> course

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
not likely be in any danger of course

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.179 
not likely be in any danger of course
I'm<00:01:09.920> not<00:01:10.189> implying<00:01:10.399> that<00:01:11.530> also<00:01:12.530> check<00:01:12.950> on<00:01:13.100> the

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
I'm not implying that also check on the

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.010 
I'm not implying that also check on the
curtain<00:01:13.399> or<00:01:13.670> pirates<00:01:14.060> cove<00:01:14.359> from<00:01:14.689> time<00:01:14.899> to

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
curtain or pirates cove from time to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.380 
curtain or pirates cove from time to
time<00:01:15.079> the<00:01:16.009> character<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.609> there<00:01:16.759> seems<00:01:17.149> unique

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
time the character in there seems unique

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.779 
time the character in there seems unique
and<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.319> becomes<00:01:18.649> more<00:01:18.770> active<00:01:19.130> at<00:01:19.729> the

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
and that becomes more active at the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.550 
and that becomes more active at the
cameras<00:01:20.179> made<00:01:20.389> off<00:01:20.630> for<00:01:21.109> long<00:01:21.229> periods<00:01:21.259> of

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
cameras made off for long periods of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.069 
cameras made off for long periods of
time<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:22.389> guess<00:01:23.389> it<00:01:23.509> doesn't<00:01:23.659> like<00:01:23.869> being

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
time I guess it doesn't like being

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.190 
time I guess it doesn't like being
watched<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:24.920> don't<00:01:25.159> know<00:01:25.630> anyway<00:01:26.630> I'm<00:01:27.139> sure

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
watched I don't know anyway I'm sure

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.289 
watched I don't know anyway I'm sure
they<00:01:27.469> have<00:01:27.619> everything<00:01:27.649> else<00:01:28.159> control<00:01:28.579> I'll

they have everything else control I'll
