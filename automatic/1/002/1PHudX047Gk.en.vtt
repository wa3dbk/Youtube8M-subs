lighter<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:34.979> gives<00:01:35.190> me<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.550> light

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
lighter and that gives me all the light

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
lighter and that gives me all the light
I<00:01:35.729> need<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> need<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:38.660> because<00:01:39.660> we<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.140> get

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
I need if I need to because we might get

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
I need if I need to because we might get
some<00:01:40.700> rain<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.880> possibly<00:01:42.300> some<00:01:42.479> thunderstorms

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
so I put a little warning up on the tent
basically<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> couple<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.880> poles<00:01:48.680> there's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
basically just a couple of poles there's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.529 
basically just a couple of poles there's
a<00:01:49.740> slide<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> top<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> tent<00:01:51.360> there

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
a slide up at the top of the tent there

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.749 
a slide up at the top of the tent there
that<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:51.780> slides<00:01:51.990> onto<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.679> then<00:01:53.550> just

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that it slides onto and then just

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.350 
that it slides onto and then just
velcro's<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:56.429> you've<00:01:56.550> got<00:01:56.640> three<00:01:57.090> pigs

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
velcro's and then you've got three pigs

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.469 
velcro's and then you've got three pigs
on<00:01:57.690> each<00:01:57.899> side<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.759> maintain<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.119> Candis

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
on each side just to maintain the Candis

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.749 
on each side just to maintain the Candis
but<00:02:01.319> uh<00:02:02.450> for<00:02:03.450> example<00:02:03.929> when<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.050> was<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.759> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
but uh for example when I was at the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.320 
but uh for example when I was at the
last<00:02:05.940> place<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:07.880> can't<00:02:08.880> remember<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> name

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
last place there can't remember the name
