00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
face g13 deck let's start out with the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.160 
face g13 deck let's start out with the
shape<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.800> bit<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> website<00:00:18.960> this

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
shape it is it's bit on the website this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.380 
shape it is it's bit on the website this
is<00:00:19.230> based<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.090> t12<00:00:21.090> deep<00:00:21.480> shape<00:00:21.840> which<00:00:23.390> if

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is based off the t12 deep shape which if

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.870 
is based off the t12 deep shape which if
you<00:00:24.930> ever<00:00:25.140> had<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> g12<00:00:25.830> deep<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.670> there

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you ever had a g12 deep because there

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.750 
you ever had a g12 deep because there
are<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.150> stock<00:00:27.420> now<00:00:27.890> they<00:00:28.890> were<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.670> good

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
are in stock now they were really good

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.030 
are in stock now they were really good
shape<00:00:30.119> um<00:00:31.850> but<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.719> made<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> wider<00:00:34.590> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
shape um but now they made it wider it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.139 
shape um but now they made it wider it's
30<00:00:35.640> point<00:00:36.090> five<00:00:36.480> millimeters<00:00:37.110> wide<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.149> its

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
30 point five millimeters wide and its

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:58.120 
30 point five millimeters wide and its
pretty<00:00:39.450> long<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:47.480> perdu<00:00:48.480> brown<00:00:48.750> wood

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.030 

you<00:00:58.940> can<00:00:59.120> see<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.480> difference<00:00:59.810> but<00:01:00.470> other

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
you can see the difference but other

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.270 
you can see the difference but other
than<00:01:01.220> that<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.790> shape<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.180> perfect<00:01:02.330> it's<00:01:02.960> like

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
than that the shape is perfect it's like

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.780 
than that the shape is perfect it's like
medium<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.430> high<00:01:04.670> kicks<00:01:05.120> more<00:01:05.480> in<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.790> high

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
medium to high kicks more in the high

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.810 
medium to high kicks more in the high
little<00:01:08.780> hot<00:01:08.960> lower<00:01:09.830> high<00:01:10.100> side<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.670> guess<00:01:11.060> um

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
little hot lower high side I guess um

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.880

an<00:01:51.560> amazing<00:01:51.830> board<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:53.000> home<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:54.850> did<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:56.119> one

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
an amazing board the home I did have one

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.800 
an amazing board the home I did have one
problem<00:01:56.720> with<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:58.040> was<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.920> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
problem with it and that was with the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.370 
problem with it and that was with the
trucks<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> truck<00:02:04.039> holes<00:02:04.660> as<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:06.259> can

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
trucks and the truck holes as you can

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.470 
trucks and the truck holes as you can
see<00:02:06.560> my<00:02:06.800> trucks<00:02:07.310> are<00:02:08.530> dump<00:02:09.530> trucks<00:02:10.270> tuned<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
see my trucks are dump trucks tuned and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.610 
see my trucks are dump trucks tuned and
when<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.540> went<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> put<00:02:15.140> them<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> board<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
when I went to put them on the board the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.850 
when I went to put them on the board the
screws<00:02:19.450> wouldn't<00:02:20.450> go<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.530> way<00:02:21.560> through

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
screws wouldn't go all the way through

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.890 
screws wouldn't go all the way through
the<00:02:21.890> board<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.819> they<00:02:22.970> wouldn't<00:02:23.240> pop<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.690> so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the board like they wouldn't pop out so

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.330 
the board like they wouldn't pop out so
you'd<00:02:24.050> be<00:02:24.170> able<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.440> tighten<00:02:24.680> into<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.100> truck

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
you'd be able to tighten into the truck

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.180 
you'd be able to tighten into the truck
they<00:02:26.060> would<00:02:26.240> actually<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.260> flush<00:02:27.920> with

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
they would actually be like flush with

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.550 
they would actually be like flush with
the<00:02:28.220> bottom<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.730> deck<00:02:28.910> which<00:02:29.440> isn't<00:02:30.440> good

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the bottom of the deck which isn't good

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.410 
the bottom of the deck which isn't good
because<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:30.980> can't<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.340> cheap<00:02:31.550> trucks<00:02:31.790> so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
because then you can't a cheap trucks so

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.240 
because then you can't a cheap trucks so
what<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.750> had<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.959> do<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.470> take<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.709> drill<00:02:34.069> bit

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
what I had to do was take a drill bit

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.380 
what I had to do was take a drill bit
and<00:02:34.450> bore<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.630> down<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> little<00:02:36.140> bit<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:37.390> to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and bore it down a little bit just to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.720 
and bore it down a little bit just to
put<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.720> screw<00:02:39.020> in<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.440> would<00:02:39.590> fit<00:02:39.730> but

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
put the screw in so it would fit but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.210 
put the screw in so it would fit but
other<00:02:40.940> than<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.620> everything<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.010> deck

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
other than that everything on this deck

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.580 
other than that everything on this deck
is<00:02:43.250> perfect<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.030> craftsmanship<00:02:44.450> ten<00:02:45.319> out<00:02:45.470> of

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
is perfect the craftsmanship ten out of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.670 
is perfect the craftsmanship ten out of
ten<00:02:46.360> performance<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:49.330> give<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> 10-2<00:02:51.140> I'll

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
ten performance I give that a 10-2 I'll

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.300 
ten performance I give that a 10-2 I'll
give<00:02:52.209> Berlin<00:02:53.209> wooden<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.750> flat<00:02:53.990> phase<00:02:54.200> 10<00:02:54.500> if<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
give Berlin wooden on flat phase 10 if I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.339 
give Berlin wooden on flat phase 10 if I
ever<00:02:55.520> get<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.970> new<00:02:56.180> another<00:02:56.690> deck<00:02:56.959> which

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
ever get a new another deck which

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.120 
ever get a new another deck which
probably<00:02:57.950> won't<00:02:58.160> need<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.910> because<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.450> is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
probably won't need to because this is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.160 
probably won't need to because this is
really<00:03:01.130> good<00:03:01.400> setup<00:03:01.819> Oh<00:03:04.630> it'll<00:03:05.630> definitely<00:03:05.930> be
