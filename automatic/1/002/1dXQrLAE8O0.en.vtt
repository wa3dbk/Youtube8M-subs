00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 Unfortunately, a band or a write on 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 message among the comments yes one 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.820
 message under the comments you can 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.529
 also write under the comments 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.760
 he wanted to say I feel with the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.380
 Visitor you are you make the man 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.849
 possible to have so in the game with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.320
 expand magazine and always seen 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.050
 work and no idea 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.350
 I have thereby a shaft and 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 no 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 because as I said the later knows mine 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.320
 Appeal be the flying paper 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.190
 plane nobody calls in professional circles 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 then the box so the unique box 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.680
 just as unique are the perpetrators here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 the unique one can not do anything amt 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.910
 say because the box brings one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 From the conclusion so you have the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.379
 Cozy somewhere and throw one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.719
 just wasting time where you can 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.890
 90 people actually hear ours 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.869
 cash right or away from the page 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.330
 Could be exactly because of that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.360
 never recommend this treasure chest 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.490
 to do except is since 1 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 the neck has never been on it but 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 my subscribers have always been mine 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 is my sausage to watch those are 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590
 no loops that's why it does me 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.350
 just not like me because I 'm there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.479
 Namely only angeles comes out and what 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.000
 because it really comes out most of the time 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.700
 business role if you really times 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 click us a swarm house comes 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.060
 but hey if you're lucky then 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.409
 you have to the programs from understood 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.000
 so I legal 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.289
 you see I have my quattrone right away 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.450
 quadrocopter quattro no idea 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.710
 reached and I am learning completely 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.580
 usually only once looking for a corner where 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.099
 i can hurt before and before 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.899
 stuck wanted to understand why you can 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.910
 you promise but you have to stop 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.349
 not if I stopped because 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.800
 I thought well promise you 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:09.130
 you know that's the first corner 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.670
 The closing year for the upside is 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.430
 found 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.910
 but the bus badly makes me the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.180
 string 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.580
 that is why we are looking for another 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.320
 she had reported substances 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.170
 I thought hey puts this time completely 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.550
 Cozy up that coach first out 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.950
 head on the keyboard where actually 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.830
 get up and sing and then the location 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.060
 abgecheckt only times my rough environment where 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.480
 I go around a bit better and then slightly 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.060
 ventured forward you have seen it 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.260
 yellow box lights up that is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.480
 danger an opponent comes is longer 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.190
 is not bad is the choice 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.460
 already people because this beast holds two 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.040
 sensational hits but what has 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.160
 the whole sensational is the m with 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.170
 These things so you can indeed with the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.290
 mouse control is clear we play there 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.180
 no other companies here but you have to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.020
 Then meet a bit more closely 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.800
 and that too often 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.020
 and what's up with this 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.120
 here is the purpose of the comments 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.950
 not really because I'm back 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.270
 spontaneously recorded and you 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.250
 know how that is when the spontaneous 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.440
 you have to go through there topic 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.050
 but the subject of this comment is 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.820
 then no topic from what do you say 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:39.070
 unless of course that's what this is 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:46.000
 best war is in black ops 2 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:51.530
 but i'm dying here in the room now yes 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.280
 beautiful from the electro stÃ¼bbeken intestine so 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.000
 I had 18 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.170
 war is never bad 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.170
 so i can not do it better 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 I would be interested in what her 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.790
 Weapons uses horny killstreaks and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.700
 statements which I have not even you 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.960
 never asked so just write me 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.420
 purely down her we know that we 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.780
 the money works again i can 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.730
 Definitely recommend the new 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.980
 to use business for a weapon 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.490
 that would be in the district office and one 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.240
 typical weapon that worth your broom 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:31.730
 and with the things until then it works 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.680
 actually best so short 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.510
 comments is probably now transmitter I was 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.070
 last rest of nine play because of it 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.370
 Just let me go fresh 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:50.490
 because I'm here as manifest ecclestone 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.650
 do you have to imagine what is then 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.070
 I suppose I do not solve anything then I am 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.460
 I'm just dying on the right 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.350
 I left the street straight ahead 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.360
 you think that will be a great game 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.820
 play I can put on youtube 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.050
 What's the bottom line, we lose 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.240
 and I already like that 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.820
 Company band actually show front 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.950
 wanted to show you video no idea 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.950
 I'm out I'm gone
