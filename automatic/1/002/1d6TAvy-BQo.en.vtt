00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it is standard bite SMS so first thing

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.020 
it is standard bite SMS so first thing
we're<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.259> rename<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.030> we

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
we're going to do is rename that we

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
we're going to do is rename that we
could<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.270> delete<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.259> usual<00:01:55.680> i

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
could just delete it but as usual i

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.230 
could just delete it but as usual i
don't<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.310> deleting<00:01:56.700> things<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.149> i<00:01:57.210> have

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to so we'll just keep it there in case

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.060 
to so we'll just keep it there in case
you'll<00:01:59.490> need<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> use<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.060> again<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you'll need to use it again so that's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.740

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
go perfect so it's as simple as that we

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.310 
go perfect so it's as simple as that we
just<00:02:38.320> have<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.470> do<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> respring<00:02:39.160> here<00:02:39.370> and
