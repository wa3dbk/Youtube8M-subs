engines with a diesel cycle which means

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
engines with a diesel cycle which means

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.359 
engines we where the diesel cycle have
also<00:01:57.659> around<00:01:58.079> 30%<00:01:58.560> lower<00:01:59.250> fuel<00:02:00.240> consumption

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
also around 30% lower fuel consumption

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.399 
also around 30% lower fuel consumption
new<00:02:02.369> innovative<00:02:03.180> technology<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.079> one

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
new innovative technology is one

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.800 
new innovative technology is one
important<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.579> cut<00:02:05.759> fuel<00:02:06.119> consumption

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
important way to cut fuel consumption

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710 
important way to cut fuel consumption
but<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> human<00:02:08.160> factor<00:02:08.550> also<00:02:09.119> has<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> huge

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
but the human factor also has a huge

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
but the human factor also has a huge
impact<00:02:11.030> where<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.420> same
