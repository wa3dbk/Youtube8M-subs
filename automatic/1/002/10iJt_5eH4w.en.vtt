this<00:00:21.630> actually<00:00:22.640> isn't<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.060> device<00:00:24.900> defect<00:00:26.359> it's

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
this actually isn't a device defect it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.929 
this actually isn't a device defect it's
it<00:00:28.650> seems<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.519> actually<00:00:29.760> something

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it seems to be actually something

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
it seems to be actually something
they've<00:00:30.269> done<00:00:30.480> by<00:00:30.660> design<00:00:31.080> they<00:00:31.650> actually

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they've done by design they actually

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.729 
they've done by design they actually
have<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.219> option<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> phone<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.390> turn<00:00:33.739> data

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
have an option in the phone to turn data

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.860 
have an option in the phone to turn data
access<00:00:35.309> over<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> mobile<00:00:36.030> network<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
access over the mobile network on and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.069 
access over the mobile network on and
off<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.500> by<00:00:37.860> default<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.610> appears<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.719> that

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
off and by default it appears to be that

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
off and by default it appears to be that
it's<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:41.219> by<00:00:42.059> default<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.860> I'm<00:00:43.860> assuming<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's off by default so I'm assuming that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
it's off by default so I'm assuming that
they<00:00:44.879> did<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.360> prevent<00:00:45.809> unexpected

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
they did that to prevent unexpected

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.150 
they did that to prevent unexpected
