00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.980
 Good morning guys here again I'll go 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.050
 redo the son I made last week 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 delayed it was the change I made 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.880
 an official xr 10 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 I recorded it in Portuguese and English 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 only that the video in Portuguese he was 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 no sound 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 had only 10 seconds of sound and then 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 it was good and I could not solve the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 I put the problem I sent the video 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.349
 but three times and always there was no sound and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 So I ended up taking English too. 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 so I'm going to show you the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.910
 Last modification I made on xr 10 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 which now has the steering wheel 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.230
 also here I'll show you that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 I have several options 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 already in the configuration that allows the radio 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 radio as you know use the are or r 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.719
 tronic mt four in four channels that I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.309
 I did here I had to change with almost 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.780
 almost all rear axle 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 practically practically is not 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.530
 identical to the front axle now today 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.189
 rear panel did not allow the installation 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 of pieces just to take off the wheels 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.210
 I had to make the front axle 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 I could only take advantage of the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 inner rear axle gears 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.780
 but I still had to change one 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.689
 gear shaft to fit 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.500
 to be able to work with the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.590
 front and thanks to my radio I have 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.280
 here different functions for example here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 today not only on the front wheels 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.820
 including showing on the radio here 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:46.250
 secure him here in the knee and you can see 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:49.290
 that it will not be better to show here 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 that I had to do here I put 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.210
 this button the conference may have 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 written to the front of the front to Iran that is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.329
 the normal and reverse 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 here is the forehead of what will happen 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.810
 only front wheel a show for more 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:14.100
 near here only the front wheels 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.650
 if I move here just to laugh the wheels 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.170
 but here's a glitch that has 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.350
 this system has some bug here some 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.140
 thing that has a defect can be my 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 radio or whatever the receiver but only 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 the front wheel when I also move as 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.960
 the front also moves a little give 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.200
 a light weight of the front wheels 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.620
 well this should not happen 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.840
 It was only Mexico that brought it to 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.090
 another function is not normal which is the famous 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 crab 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.400
 they turn to the same side so he 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.650
 walk sideways and reverse function them 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.900
 will come true 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.020
 I'll show you how it's in there 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:07.680
 only reverse function is just makes a good ray 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.830
 bigger or smaller is the best to walk 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:22.160
 in small space normal function 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:22.160
 Look at the crab just the right side. 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.580
 It's really cool, too, in my opinion. 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.250
 function are the only two that I go 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.500
 I think any guys use my 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.550
 recommendation who wants to do 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.830
 This need not do everything I did. 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.830
 honestly, if you need to buy 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.650
 all front axle equipment 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.390
 you can have this option of 10 but it is not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.360
 necessary that all these functions here 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.840
 just forward, just bring the two in 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.739
 same side and the two in a universe that 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.300
 Why do you need a radio? 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.709
 mainly the same and if you have this 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.830
 function is a mix 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.709
 only the style links that it does it 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.700
 simply copy everything I do in the 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.769
 first channel 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.989
 ie the gay club plus a receiver 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.630
 one more deer excuses the Serbian who has 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.000
 a rear axle plugin on channel 4 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.680
 I had to come here in the options that 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.140
 probably will not appear will not 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.090
 It's good to see you, but I had to come. 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.050
 here in his options 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.230
 and set I want this add button 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.230
 on 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:39.449
 the trio 14 34 there is in the auxiliary channel 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.830
 I also apologize 30 21 30 33 bringing 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.479
 assistant 2 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.180
 I had to put it here in the steppe of a 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:53.010
 for one such technicians can see that the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:54.479
 steppe below 2525 2525 you are this 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.340
 technical post here on this other button 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.260
 altogether 25 50 75 without that is that 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.729
 difference in speed at which the axis 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.729
 front and rear beyond the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.650
 if I put 50 50 it's going to stay like this 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.020
 I put it from behind will be this 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.789
 because I made it this way if I were from 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.130
 1 to 1 and stay one two three four 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.680
 five and up to 100 in 100 is when you 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.470
 blocks at 100% in the axes 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.660
 so I had no need to put 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.270
 one-to-one steppe is the only way to 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.990
 enable this function here, which 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.870
 appeared the front in the ie is normal and the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.850
 reverse step 2 tech 3 or 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.260
 any other technician would not have this 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.240
 Function 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.099
 I had put one more option either 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.720
 use this button from below to connect 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.610
 and turn off the mix of direction but I found 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.500
 I do not have to keep calling and 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.139
 Turning off why just leave it here. 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.539
 always on the front axle ready 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.880
 will stay on the front axle 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.430
 now the steering only on the rear wheel 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.130
 I say probably I will never go 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.610
 use the type I saw no utility at all 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.320
 Sunflower on back wheels that is useful for 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.190
 me this function 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.720
 the crab function honestly 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.810
 these are the two functions that I go 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.930
 use I think just steering on the wheels 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.639
 front and was also using very little 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.560
 from the moment I got on the wheel 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.390
 back I want to use what I'm going to do 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.600
 a ray make curve better 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.400
 so it's kind of pointless and 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.080
 thinking that I came to the 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.450
 conclusion also if you want to do this 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.460
 on your xr 10 on your other crawler 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.240
 any crawler the cart that have this 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.210
 option 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.070
 My suggestion is not if you do not have one. 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.650
 that already have this function 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.610
 do not spend money buying the radio alone 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.810
 to do this 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.960
 that will hardly use my recommendation is 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:57.040
 get a free normal radio it does not fit 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.810
 y takes a cable and connects the brain 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.360
 front and rear on channel 11 and 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.520
 ready you will have the main function 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.610
 what is this one there? 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.610
 and they will come independently will 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.010
 make your cart will be much more and 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.980
 this is the most useful function for 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:18.490
 the cause of truth but it is there to 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.410
 guys now my x r10 is complete 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.810
 in my opinion if you are going to do some 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.000
 change and beast thing for example tire 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.160
 who is putting a better tire some 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.140
 thing of what I already am 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:36.850
 using mode 4 ws is the focus this already 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:40.150
 I'm with another attachment that is my sm2 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:43.120
 which already has the function of differentiating 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:46.120
 different power front wheel in the 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.060
 wheel is locked or 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:53.590
 opposite rear right wheel in the 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:57.900
 Front braked is not that guys wanted 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.900
 Show the beauty, bye, bye.
