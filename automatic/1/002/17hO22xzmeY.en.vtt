that's<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.580> loved<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.420> lot

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that's what I loved about is that a lot

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.910 
that's what I loved about is that a lot
of<00:01:18.750> people<00:01:18.840> were<00:01:19.110> thinking<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.799> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
of people were thinking that it was just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.859 
of people were thinking that it was just
gonna<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.310> derivative<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> film<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
gonna be a derivative of that film but I

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.149 
gonna be a derivative of that film but I
think<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> best<00:01:22.770> possible

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
think it was the best possible

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
think it was the best possible
combination<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.360> genres<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.840> styles<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
combination of genres and styles and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.130 
combination of genres and styles and
what<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.520> enjoy<00:01:26.549> about<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
what I really enjoy about it is when you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
what I really enjoy about it is when you
realized<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> film<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.250> it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
realized what the film is that it's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
realized what the film is that it's
basically<00:01:29.759> about<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.150> guy<00:01:30.299> repeating<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
basically about this guy repeating the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
basically about this guy repeating the
day<00:01:31.079> over<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.439> over<00:01:31.530> again<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
day over and over again you think that

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.800 
day over and over again you think that
it<00:01:32.670> could<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.880> stale<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.479> they're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
it could get stale that they're going to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.390 
it could get stale that they're going to
be<00:01:33.930> repeating<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> same<00:01:34.560> scenes<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.250> they

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
be repeating the same scenes which they

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
be repeating the same scenes which they
do<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.180> very<00:01:36.600> planned<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.170> they

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
do but they it's very planned out they

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
do but they it's very planned out they
they<00:01:37.770> make<00:01:37.979> sure<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> show<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.210> same

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
they make sure to show you the same

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.240

scenes<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> very<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.439> specific<00:01:40.890> reason

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
scenes for a very very specific reason

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
scenes for a very very specific reason
and<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.939> veer<00:01:42.240> off<00:01:42.270> into<00:01:42.810> other

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and then we veer off into other

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
laughing and clapping and and it was a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.220 
laughing and clapping and and it was a
good<00:02:14.849> time<00:02:15.120> yeah<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.569> didn't<00:02:15.930> mean<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.049> suggest

good time yeah I didn't mean to suggest

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
good time yeah I didn't mean to suggest
that<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> film<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.010> devoid<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.489> any<00:02:17.730> kind<00:02:17.970> of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that the film was devoid of any kind of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.729 
that the film was devoid of any kind of
deeper<00:02:18.360> thought<00:02:18.599> I'm<00:02:18.720> sure<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.439> playing

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
deeper thought I'm sure it is playing

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.190 
deeper thought I'm sure it is playing
with<00:02:19.950> things<00:02:20.159> like<00:02:20.370> memory<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.540> history<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
with things like memory and history and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.250 
with things like memory and history and
how<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:22.860> recount<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.870> think<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
how we recount that and I think that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.289 
how we recount that and I think that
they<00:02:25.409> use<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.220> their<00:02:26.400> advantage<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:27.090> this

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
they use that to their advantage in this

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.670 
they use that to their advantage in this
kind<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.599> video<00:02:27.840> game<00:02:28.049> aesthetic<00:02:28.500> that's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
kind of video game aesthetic that's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890 
kind of video game aesthetic that's
going<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.370> film<00:02:29.640> where<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.299> get<00:02:30.689> to
