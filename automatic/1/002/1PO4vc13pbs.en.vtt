these little strands is like a stem of
the<00:00:09.420> plant<00:00:09.710> if<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.860> cut<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.160> where<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.880> lives

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the plant if you cut it where it lives

the plant if you cut it where it lives
that's<00:00:12.450> its<00:00:12.630> root<00:00:12.840> system<00:00:12.870> that's<00:00:13.440> where<00:00:13.710> it

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that's its root system that's where it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.289 
that's its root system that's where it
lives<00:00:14.009> you're<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.910> guaranteed

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299

lives you're going to be guaranteed
better<00:00:16.020> positioning<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.490> right<00:00:17.730> now

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
better positioning because right now

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.400

with<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> hair<00:00:18.390> being<00:00:18.539> dry<00:00:18.840> its<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.320> its

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
with the hair being dry its in its

with the hair being dry its in its
resting<00:00:19.920> place<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.580> exactly<00:00:21.029> where<00:00:21.240> it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
resting place it's exactly where it
lives<00:00:21.800> therefore<00:00:22.800> why<00:00:22.949> don't<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.490> cut

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
lives therefore why don't you just cut

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
lives therefore why don't you just cut
it<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.269> would<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> did<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it like you would like if you did if you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.259 
it like you would like if you did if you
trim<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.250> trimmed<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:26.849> tree<00:00:27.090> or

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
trim it if you trimmed a little tree or

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.700 
trim it if you trimmed a little tree or
a<00:00:27.300> plant<00:00:27.480> you'll<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.109> taking<00:00:28.470> where<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
a plant you'll be just taking where the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
a plant you'll be just taking where the
branches<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.340> you'll<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.330> cutting<00:00:30.510> them

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
branches are you'll just be cutting them

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.350 
branches are you'll just be cutting them
there<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:32.009> makes<00:00:32.279> perfect<00:00:32.489> sense<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.180> it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
there it makes perfect sense but it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090 
there it makes perfect sense but it's
not<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.660> our<00:00:33.750> training<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.559> weren't<00:00:34.800> trained

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
not in our training we weren't trained

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850 
not in our training we weren't trained
to<00:00:35.280> cut<00:00:35.430> curly<00:00:35.610> hair<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.170> that's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
to cut curly hair this way at all that's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.860 
to cut curly hair this way at all that's
why<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> lot<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.460> people<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:38.870> speculative

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
why a lot of people are very speculative

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
why a lot of people are very speculative
because<00:00:40.250> it's<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.489> been<00:00:41.640> written<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.000> the

because it's not been written in the
