00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
seconds and then a downloaded start and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.930 
seconds and then a downloaded start and
will<00:02:42.480> end<00:02:42.750> n<00:02:42.960> dot<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> PK<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
will end n dot a PK and this is the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.750 
will end n dot a PK and this is the
reason<00:02:45.240> why<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.420> won't<00:02:45.840> work<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
reason why it won't work on the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.480 
reason why it won't work on the
captivate<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> captivate<00:02:48.600> is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
captivate because the captivate is

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.310 
captivate because the captivate is
eighteen<00:02:50.490> T<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> eighteen<00:02:51.390> T<00:02:51.660> doesn't<00:02:52.140> allow

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
eighteen T and eighteen T doesn't allow

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.610 
eighteen T and eighteen T doesn't allow
