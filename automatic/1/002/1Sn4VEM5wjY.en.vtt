00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.450
 Welcome to this new 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.500
 video of me today I will show how 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.980
 you are already in the title 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.400
 Read how to fly in ls 2013 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.210
 can 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.680
 and the good thing is you do not have to 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.220
 do not even download something 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.380
 It's easy and you can do it 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 own files then you go to my game 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 somic simulator 2013 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.180
 and then you will find such a folder here 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.969
 I say or document and then 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 would then have to use the right mouse button 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 click on it and must be editor 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.420
 then open these windows come here and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 there you have to control 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.469
 if controls then you have to take place 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.859
 if true, enter 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:08.670
 so here you have that handy 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:13.229
 to enter that works here and there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
 even then he goes up and up 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.110
 to save 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.009
 and yes, we'll meet again soon 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.009

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.280
 Welcome back here in the game and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.050

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.950

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.480

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.940

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.580

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.050

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.880
 How to fly is 2013 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.209
 It's easy, you do not have to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.019
 install somehow or so you can 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.050
 continue with the button ball animal 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.920
 climb up and with the button you can 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.260
 sink again 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.500
 You can adjust that by the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.080
 Shift so where you just normal 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.640

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.320

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.670

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.420
 me also about a new subscriber 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.720
 looking forward 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.630
 and who now asks where the link for 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.760
 this mod is futile for the sake of 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.510
 there is no one for this place 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.580
 program 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.709
 you just have to do it like that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.600
 I showed you at the beginning of the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.940
 videos and there should be one 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.040
 work if it fails with some 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.440
 gives me or so terribly quiet to me 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.790
 I'll answer everyone and then 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.070
 I hope to see you next time 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.070
 see you again and by then it will be fine
