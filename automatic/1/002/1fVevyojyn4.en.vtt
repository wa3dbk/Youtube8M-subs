00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 and there people are never a video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 de itu beetle commented on who speaks 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.189
 It's the team this time we have one more. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.500
 episode of the series on the subway 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.219
 I hope you like it, so this is it. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.219
 although the video 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.480
 some change in the modifications that the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
 my voice became very good short 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.260
 distance 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.450
 however the average distance having 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.570
 difficulty in controlling the use of 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.520
 then the modification I modified was 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.890
 the following improved strangeness 3 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.550
 which increases the reach of the weapon to the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 club jec 3 that increases the speed of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 clicks the speed of the shot you can 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.420
 achieve with your 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.480
 the objective was to improve the pace of 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.040
 shots so I could hit more bullets 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.220
 do not even kill me 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.890
 so always two shots were missing a shot 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.230
 because mine with my control is well 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.740
 slow then I think Corinthians already 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.320
 what guy 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.080
 at close range solved this but the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.360
 long distance I have to control 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.700
 still focus more on 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 get that that because the rich 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.090
 he changed slightly on the move 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 still having some defects of the defects 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.530
 very basic ones that are of choice 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.020
 paths that I must follow that he 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 enemy he had already taken 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.219
 completely the place of Sunday and Thursday 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.259
 So what should I have done? 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.570
 I could not have passed the line should 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.340
 I went by the parking lot and yes I 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.590
 would have a better view of what was 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.689
 happening within that time 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.270
 so it was not what I did I just 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.079
 jumping the fence and had a good situation 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.610
 bad 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.439
 one thing I also want to talk about 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.969
 You, I'm still very afraid of 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.619
 to face certain weapons 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:00.680
 they are a joke to the hollow tmg the tommy gun 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.719
 from time to time there is more than cadence 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.229
 very high and very mobile 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.990
 pro enemy then I keep thinking like this 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.940
 I'm going to die so I'll run away so 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.000
 I just think that I can not 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.980
 focus on the enemy and take what is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.650
 so I become a very easy target 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.140
 because instead of inside the damage or me 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.900
 I end up taking damage because I'm running away 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.970
 so it's a horrible choice you have 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.600
 to go up without fear and try 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.450
 to hit 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.940
 if you killed beauties and died now 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.060
 close has to be this way and mania 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.340
 fear of these weapons must end 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.650
 a tip you make before offered me 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.489
 That's if you have too close to the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.110
 your enemy 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.420
 you do not need to right click 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 for you to improve you can eat 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 born normally have to use this 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.260
 same as closing more because the indentation 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.940
 will not interfere so much since 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.610
 it's very close you'll get 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.160
 set shots on the album there thing 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.120
 important is you hit more shots of the 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.450
 that your enemy 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.880
 quickly the background gameplay is a 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.180
 good part was against the fla if he is 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.850
 Enitec very good he makes a jeep 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.580
 shots can hit it's a thing 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.810
 very good of him feature 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.950
 controls very well 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.660
 the tech is already more unstable 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.310
 It's time that I go well and have time that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.049
 I'm very bad 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.290
 the people who are already more accustomed 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.510
 with hitech and its variations 75 and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.750
 vasek two already makes a move called 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.840
 of ambu shot you use the already looking link 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.510
 I use olim and jump with it you 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.090
 will get a slightly bigger view 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.340
 there is a corridor of some area that you 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.470
 you need to pass 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.000
 if you find an enemy you 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.230
 fired your weapon 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.470
 then this is sometimes good and others 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.140
 Sometimes it 's bad because you'll see now 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.750
 flu is trying to make the goal 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.970
 He's going to come and pull him a shot. 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.459
 gets a very good area that I do not 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.400
 I will have coverage but some in the position 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.329
 that he is and he can take 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.850
 archive 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.980
 On the other hand, when I answer 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.329
 I'll go and get the goal I lost. 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.200
 I was born in the same place as the people 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.389
 faced 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.220
 It's just that we reversed it. 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.709
 was to make the same move 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.380
 only as he is giving one more point 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.440
 high and jump there would suffer that 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.990
 Fall animation he could not move 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.160
 more on for some time by some 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.039
 seconds 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.690
 so this one of his choice was well 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.700
 bad if it had come a little more 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.620
 Calm down maybe I would have died 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.600
 now to end when I'm playing 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.820
 with this type of player who is a 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.250
 player who has the most 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.169
 practice is because the game is a long time 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.259
 but I lost a lot 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.870
 practice is I can learn from the 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.779
 drive them I'm being a little 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.340
 more cautious dwarf all the time because 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:01.490
 You're seeing that I'm still drinking. 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.069
 bad decisions but over time this will 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.770
 if he got it right and had another match that 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.569
 I played with the ranking group and it was 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.909
 very disastrous 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.969
 who was there near the coil that 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.370
 square 6 Chinese and is a place that you 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.379
 does not have much coverage 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.639
 So you end up going hand in hand 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:24.680
 everyone and how they had 111 snip and 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.680
 I was afraid to stay too long 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.349
 Then I would try the plate to try and get it 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.139
 but that does not give much personal 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.449
 It has more control of the sights that I then 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.180
 I like to play against them 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.520
 even being a user a little more from here 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.180
 a few days I post better than them who 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.819
 You know 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.659
 or to win some missions against 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.819
 they 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.009
 so personal but that's right the game 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.589
 they will not suffer cuts like 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.620
 suffered before defends in fade out 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:56.509
 I will always choose now to accelerate the 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.300
 video for you to know what is 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:01.370
 happening on that one clip 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.889
 so I think it's clearer and you 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.800
 understand if you liked it and its like yours 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.599
 favorite comment if possible and until 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.599
 the next time I said go
