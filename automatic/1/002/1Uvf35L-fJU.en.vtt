pins on it try this pin mmm don't worry
about<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> trial<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> error

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
about it but a bit of trial and error

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.740 
about it but a bit of trial and error
yeah<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> find<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.699> okay

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
yeah I'm going to find this one is okay

yeah I'm going to find this one is okay
actually<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.870> pin<00:01:00.559> least<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.460> back

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
actually this pin least we can get back

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:17.149 
actually this pin least we can get back
so<00:01:04.080> what's<00:01:04.260> these<00:01:04.470> two<00:01:04.710> pins<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:14.000> okay<00:01:16.159> cool

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so what's these two pins here okay cool

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.020 
so what's these two pins here okay cool
I<00:01:17.390> if<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.509> telepath<00:01:19.080> sugar<00:01:19.409> pop<00:01:22.700> ok<00:01:23.700> let's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I if I telepath sugar pop ok let's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.649 
I if I telepath sugar pop ok let's
bloody<00:01:24.330> gun<00:01:24.650> that's<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:28.220> I'll<00:01:29.220> pop<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
bloody gun that's it I'll pop the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
bloody gun that's it I'll pop the
electron<00:01:30.659> gun<00:01:31.640> look<00:01:32.640> carefully<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:34.369> don't<00:01:35.369> know

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
electron gun look carefully I don't know

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980 
electron gun look carefully I don't know
where<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> actually<00:01:35.970> open<00:01:36.450> circle<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
where it actually open circle but I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490 
where it actually open circle but I
can't<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> old<00:01:37.740> actually<00:01:38.070> bird<00:01:38.250> here

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.680 

must<00:01:42.500> be<00:01:42.590> in<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.830> gun<00:01:43.100> itself<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.580> popped<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.000> so

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
must be in the gun itself I popped it so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.930 
must be in the gun itself I popped it so
I<00:01:44.990> want<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:45.650> shitty<00:01:45.980> mark<00:01:46.280> away<00:01:46.550> from<00:01:46.760> not<00:01:46.910> using

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
I want a shitty mark away from not using

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.440 
I want a shitty mark away from not using
that<00:01:47.270> one<00:01:47.390> either<00:01:47.480> mark<00:01:47.720> or<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.020> too<00:01:48.140> good

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
that one either mark or it's too good

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.880 
that one either mark or it's too good
right<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.660> I<00:01:50.690> get<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.900> really<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.350> crappy

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
right so I get a really really crappy

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.210 
right so I get a really really crappy
one<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.040> don't<00:01:52.190> care<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.490> bit<00:01:53.770> put<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.130> it

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
one I don't care a bit put these in it

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.670 
one I don't care a bit put these in it
when<00:01:55.640> i<00:01:55.730> finish<00:01:55.970> with<00:01:56.060> them<00:01:56.320> this<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.470> red

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
when i finish with them this is a red

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.050 
when i finish with them this is a red
gun<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:59.600> kill<00:01:59.810> this<00:01:59.930> tape<00:02:00.170> off<00:02:00.320> here<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:02.030> be

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
gun you kill this tape off here can be

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.880 
gun you kill this tape off here can be
very<00:02:02.390> careful<00:02:02.870> or<00:02:02.930> CRT<00:02:03.260> because<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:03.740> got<00:02:03.860> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
very careful or CRT because you got a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.620 
very careful or CRT because you got a
high<00:02:04.070> vacuum<00:02:04.340> inside<00:02:04.730> here<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.540> was

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
high vacuum inside here and it was

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.710 
high vacuum inside here and it was
obviously<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.020> weakest<00:02:06.350> part<00:02:10.510> trace<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.690> back

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
obviously the weakest part trace it back

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.490 
obviously the weakest part trace it back
so<00:02:12.320> we've<00:02:12.440> got<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.680> pin<00:02:13.990> have<00:02:14.990> another<00:02:15.320> one

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so we've got this pin have another one

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.770 
so we've got this pin have another one
going<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:17.750> seeds<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.860> one<00:02:19.780> time

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
going to seeds this one time

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.570 
going to seeds this one time
these<00:02:21.050> two<00:02:21.260> here<00:02:21.380> I've<00:02:21.500> been<00:02:21.740> other<00:02:22.220> ones<00:02:22.459> that

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
these two here I've been other ones that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.510 
these two here I've been other ones that
were<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> plug<00:02:22.910> into<00:02:26.920> I've<00:02:27.920> got<00:02:28.070> more<00:02:28.250> guns

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
were to plug into I've got more guns

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:40.150

this<00:03:25.549> thing<00:03:25.760> here<00:03:25.940> spinning<00:03:26.239> up<00:03:26.450> with<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.600> joke

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
this thing here spinning up with a joke

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.350 
this thing here spinning up with a joke
get<00:03:27.739> about<00:03:28.010> seven<00:03:28.430> hundred<00:03:28.459> volts<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.269> it

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
get about seven hundred volts out of it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.930 
get about seven hundred volts out of it
so<00:03:29.570> that's<00:03:30.560> 30<00:03:30.830> amp<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:31.489> pretty<00:03:31.670> deadly

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
so that's 30 amp so it's pretty deadly

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.880 
so that's 30 amp so it's pretty deadly

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
we are going to find a good writer drop

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.610 
we are going to find a good writer drop
this<00:04:33.370> fly<00:04:33.639> back<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:35.110> they<00:04:35.200> got<00:04:35.320> this<00:04:35.410> big

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
this fly back and they got this big

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.030 
this fly back and they got this big
multiplier<00:04:36.780> pretty<00:04:37.780> shots<00:04:37.990> x<00:04:38.590> minus<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.830> goes

multiplier pretty shots x minus I goes

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.510 
multiplier pretty shots x minus I goes
in<00:04:39.250> comes<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:41.050> echoes<00:04:41.320> are<00:04:41.470> there<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.310> come

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
in comes the echoes are there and come

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.060 
in comes the echoes are there and come
through<00:04:42.729> these<00:04:42.790> little<00:04:43.110> diodes<00:04:44.110> or<00:04:44.350> some<00:04:44.919> sort

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
through these little diodes or some sort

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.810 
through these little diodes or some sort
of<00:04:45.130> multiplier<00:04:45.610> then<00:04:46.510> go<00:04:46.660> eat<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.900> tube<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:48.220> off

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
of multiplier then go eat a tube and off

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.900 
of multiplier then go eat a tube and off
the<00:04:48.910> voltage<00:04:49.240> multiplier<00:04:49.750> I'll<00:04:49.900> put<00:04:50.080> your<00:04:50.169> all

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
the voltage multiplier I'll put your all

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.129 
the voltage multiplier I'll put your all
and<00:04:51.910> that's<00:04:52.090> obviously<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.660> neck<00:04:52.840> board

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
and that's obviously that the neck board

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.950 
and that's obviously that the neck board
which<00:04:53.350> is<00:04:53.550> different<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.360> normal<00:04:55.690> pins

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
which is different to the normal pins

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.150 
which is different to the normal pins
and<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.199> back<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.860> slides

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160

under<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.490> achieve<00:04:57.669> neck<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.139> set<00:04:59.590> up<00:04:59.680> these

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
under to achieve neck so I set up these

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.020 
under to achieve neck so I set up these
and<00:05:00.039> pins<00:05:00.250> so<00:05:00.669> yeah<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:01.780> old<00:05:01.960> time<00:05:02.970> is<00:05:03.970> a

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
and pins so yeah the old time is a

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
and pins so yeah the old time is a
little<00:05:04.680> transform<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.800> 0<00:05:06.010> digg<00:05:06.220> resistor<00:05:06.610> so

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
little transform of 0 digg resistor so

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.779 
little transform of 0 digg resistor so
yeah<00:05:08.050> let's<00:05:08.620> fly<00:05:08.860> back<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.099> big<00:05:09.310> with<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.550> draug

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
yeah let's fly back a big with the draug

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.390 
yeah let's fly back a big with the draug
because<00:05:10.060> these<00:05:10.180> ones<00:05:10.419> here<00:05:10.570> IEC<00:05:11.139> can<00:05:12.099> do<00:05:12.250> all

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
because these ones here IEC can do all

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.710 
because these ones here IEC can do all
sorts<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.729> cool<00:05:12.910> things<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.360> but<00:05:13.539> make

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
sorts of cool things of that but make

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.219

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
little hot and birthdate away yeah let's

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.720 
little hot and birthdate away yeah let's
see<00:06:47.170> what<00:06:47.350> is<00:06:47.470> to<00:06:47.650> bit<00:06:47.800> in<00:06:47.890> last<00:06:48.130> hit<00:06:48.370> on<00:06:48.520> the

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
see what is to bit in last hit on the

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.690 
see what is to bit in last hit on the
heat<00:06:48.940> broke<00:06:49.300> it<00:06:49.480> down<00:06:49.510> real<00:06:49.990> quick<00:06:50.610> so<00:06:51.610> the

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
heat broke it down real quick so the

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.460 
heat broke it down real quick so the
only<00:06:51.820> drawback<00:06:52.270> to<00:06:52.300> these<00:06:52.570> times<00:06:52.870> the<00:06:53.290> heat

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
only drawback to these times the heat

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:01.050 
only drawback to these times the heat
breaks<00:06:53.710> on<00:06:53.950> there<00:06:58.560> so<00:06:59.560> here<00:06:59.770> next<00:07:00.430> codec<00:07:00.910> is

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
breaks on there so here next codec is

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.880 
breaks on there so here next codec is
finding<00:07:01.990> a<00:07:02.050> way<00:07:02.080> you're<00:07:02.380> getting<00:07:02.440> the<00:07:02.650> part

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
finding a way you're getting the part

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.770 
finding a way you're getting the part
and<00:07:03.160> there<00:07:03.400> so<00:07:04.240> I<00:07:04.330> get<00:07:04.570> this<00:07:04.690> fly<00:07:04.930> back<00:07:05.140> color

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
and there so I get this fly back color

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.200 
and there so I get this fly back color
and<00:07:07.780> is<00:07:07.930> very<00:07:08.020> interesting<00:07:08.700> so<00:07:09.700> yeah<00:07:09.850> thanks

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
and is very interesting so yeah thanks

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.330 
and is very interesting so yeah thanks
for<00:07:10.300> watching
