00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.329
 sun 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.570
 you can not know 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.219
 apart from the chestnuts we all know 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.499
 happens that we have the castanets of loss indicated are the flat salivary 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.009
 of the Iberian pig 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.179
 as we know it is an animal properly spain 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.109
 that it was acorn fed only acorn or beef but also 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.140
 you think 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 Ireland was more to place the castanets here in the net 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.640
 we would place here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.160
 very close to the pasco company of the cheek that we all know 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.630
 this piece 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.630
 has been very unknown for a long time even for us 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.940
 until the big chefs theaters have started requesting it 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 and what kind of cut can the castanet be 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.470
 the reason the adt and guttural picchu is one of the new aids 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 percent normally 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350
 It is very unknown in the market, especially in the Madrid club 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.220
 It's a product that, like bars, has a lot of fat that has to be 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.560
 clean for women 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.160
 once clean in that piece 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.550
 It's a product 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.490
 the very fine taste 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.940
 that we continue 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.060
 as if we had a very old 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.490
 there was a texture similar to that of the kidney 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.020
 percent in the Egulbati area 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.340
 in Andalusia as always where the Iberian pig is used the most 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.630
 well 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.860
 they approach the grill they essentially open a little bit 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 well and they are done on the grill 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 it is like 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.280
 a texture of sweetbread love 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.910
 grilled text back and forth that is delicious with a good faith 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
 the great chefs like that and that's why 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 constantly new dishes and dishes 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.360
 then the forms are sought 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.950
 a reply to a plate with a new product 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.679
 cheap and dark in it simply great with a tumult used entered into 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.619
 the kitchen 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.619
 the Spanish and the outcome a dish with this 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.279
 requires 6 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.149
 no cooking expert 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:22.489
 at home I recommend that the simplest thing in spite of yielding points citemos of 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.159
 appointment with a good olive oil 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:25.909
 and this afternoon
