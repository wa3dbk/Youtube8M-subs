00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
has three instruction manuals and I just

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.060 
has three instruction manuals and I just
completed<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> first<00:00:24.300> manual<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
completed it has about 75 pages worth of

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.600 
completed it has about 75 pages worth of
instructions<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.250> set<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:35.550> no

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
instructions and this set has no

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
instructions and this set has no
numbered<00:00:36.239> bags<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.780> anything<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> all

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
numbered bags or anything so this is all

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.100 
numbered bags or anything so this is all
the<00:00:37.770> pieces<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.760> laid<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.840> here

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the pieces that we have laid out here

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
the pieces that we have laid out here
and<00:00:40.739> anyway<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> reason<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and anyway the reason I do this is I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.330 
and anyway the reason I do this is I
just<00:00:42.180> want<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.920> goes<00:00:44.100> into

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just want you to see what goes into

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.069 
just want you to see what goes into
building<00:00:44.489> these<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.930> kind

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
building these things and just to kind

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.150 
building these things and just to kind
of<00:00:46.200> give<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> an<00:00:46.559> idea<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.100> things

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
of give you an idea what these things

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.610 
of give you an idea what these things
look<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.090> process<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> kind<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.410> hard

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
look like in process it's kind of hard

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.799 
look like in process it's kind of hard
to<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.920> some<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> inner<00:00:50.460> workings<00:00:51.000> once

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to see some of the inner workings once

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
to see some of the inner workings once
the<00:00:52.649> thing<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.980> completely<00:00:53.460> built<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the thing is completely built so I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
the thing is completely built so I
figured<00:00:54.329> it'd<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.539> give<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> an<00:00:55.050> opportunity

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
figured it'd be give you an opportunity

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
figured it'd be give you an opportunity
to<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> looks<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.730> being

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to see what it looks like as it's being

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.290 
to see what it looks like as it's being
built

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
built

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
built
so<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.840> first<00:00:58.050> built<00:00:58.410> book<00:00:59.160> gets<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so this first built book gets a lot of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
so this first built book gets a lot of
the<00:01:00.239> inner<00:01:00.539> workings<00:01:01.530> completed<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.769> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the inner workings completed and so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
the inner workings completed and so
we'll<00:01:04.890> start<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.909> front<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> going

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
we'll start with the front this is going

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
we'll start with the front this is going
to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> front<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> truck<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to be the front of the truck here this

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
to be the front of the truck here this
knob<00:01:08.549> right<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> give<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
knob right here is going to give you the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.270 
knob right here is going to give you the
two<00:01:11.430> axle<00:01:11.939> front<00:01:12.270> steering<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.070> see

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
two axle front steering so you can see

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.330 
two axle front steering so you can see
here<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> give<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
here and here it's going to give you the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.940 
here and here it's going to give you the
steering<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.939> we've<00:01:18.060> completed<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.950> also

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
steering so we've completed that also

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.710 
steering so we've completed that also
are<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.330> crane<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.189> cable<00:01:23.720> for

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
are going to have a crane or a cable for

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.200 
are going to have a crane or a cable for
the<00:01:24.930> boom<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.680> lift<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> service<00:01:27.030> truck

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the boom to lift this is a service truck

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
the boom to lift this is a service truck
or<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> tow<00:01:27.630> truck<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
or a tow truck so that's going to be the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
or a tow truck so that's going to be the
crane<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> lift<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> power

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
crane to lift it up I have all the power

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
crane to lift it up I have all the power
functions<00:01:31.560> incorporated<00:01:32.250> already<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.820> here's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
functions incorporated already so here's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
functions incorporated already so here's
one<00:01:33.270> linear<00:01:33.630> actuator<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.950> couple<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
one linear actuator there's a couple of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.730 
one linear actuator there's a couple of
the<00:01:35.490> other<00:01:35.640> linear<00:01:36.090> actuators<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> then

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the other linear actuators and then

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
the other linear actuators and then
there<00:01:37.979> underneath<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> where<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> motor

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there underneath here is where the motor

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
there underneath here is where the motor
is<00:01:39.840> mounted<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.500> there's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> pretty

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
is mounted and there's a pretty

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.830 
is mounted and there's a pretty
intricate<00:01:42.060> gear<00:01:42.420> box<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.869> there

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.480 

so<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.869> have<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.740> say<00:01:48.920> I'm<00:01:49.100> pretty<00:01:49.280> impressed

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
so I have to say I'm pretty impressed

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.179 
so I have to say I'm pretty impressed
this<00:01:49.939> set<00:01:50.240> uses<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.689> lot<00:01:50.990> different<00:01:51.740> building

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
this set uses a lot different building

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.590 
this set uses a lot different building
techniques<00:01:52.670> than<00:01:52.820> I've<00:01:52.939> ever<00:01:53.090> seen<00:01:53.390> before

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
techniques than I've ever seen before

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.069 
techniques than I've ever seen before
and<00:01:54.049> some<00:01:54.530> LEGO<00:01:54.770> Technic<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.490> know<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.479> set<00:01:56.780> it

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
and some LEGO Technic I know this set it

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.170 
and some LEGO Technic I know this set it
hasn't<00:01:57.799> had<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> lot<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> positive<00:02:01.180> reaction

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
hasn't had a lot of positive reaction

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.550 
hasn't had a lot of positive reaction
there's<00:02:02.420> been<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.659> lot<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:02.899> people<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.409> have

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
there's been a lot of people that have

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.950 
there's been a lot of people that have
some<00:02:03.770> negative<00:02:04.210> thoughts<00:02:05.210> on<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.630> but<00:02:05.840> I'm

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
some negative thoughts on this but I'm

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.450 
some negative thoughts on this but I'm
impressed<00:02:06.649> with<00:02:06.860> some<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.159> building

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
impressed with some of the building

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.309 
impressed with some of the building
techniques<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.209> one<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.959> other<00:02:09.080> neat

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
techniques and one of the other neat

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.630 
techniques and one of the other neat
things<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:09.920> set<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.280> going<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.550> be

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
things is this set is going to be

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.940 
things is this set is going to be
pneumatic<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.470> actually<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
pneumatic so this is actually the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.470 
pneumatic so this is actually the
pneumatic<00:02:13.340> pump<00:02:13.519> right<00:02:13.760> here<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:14.269> will

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
pneumatic pump right here and there will

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.600 
pneumatic pump right here and there will
be<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.630> motor<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:14.989> spins<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.430> is

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
be a motor that spins that and this is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.490 
be a motor that spins that and this is
the<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.420> main<00:02:17.540> feed<00:02:17.870> line<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.290> yellow

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
the the the main feed line the yellow

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.880 
the the the main feed line the yellow
the<00:02:18.769> blue<00:02:18.980> line<00:02:19.190> right<00:02:19.430> there<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:21.140> anyway<00:02:21.739> guys

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the blue line right there so anyway guys

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.670 
the blue line right there so anyway guys
as<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.549> complete<00:02:22.970> each<00:02:23.480> book<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.110> will<00:02:24.260> do<00:02:24.440> an

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
as I complete each book I will do an

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.770 
as I complete each book I will do an
internal<00:02:25.069> workings<00:02:25.610> review<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.299> take<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.480> look

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
internal workings review and take a look

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.270 
internal workings review and take a look
at<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.049> as<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.260> complete<00:02:27.590> each<00:02:27.739> book<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.130> that

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
at it as I complete each book so that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.440 
at it as I complete each book so that
you<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.519> see<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:28.790> these<00:02:28.910> things<00:02:28.970> look<00:02:29.269> like

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you can see what these things look like

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.539 
you can see what these things look like
as<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:30.380> get<00:02:30.590> through<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.830> construction<00:02:31.340> of

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
as we get through the construction of

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.360 
as we get through the construction of
them<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.150> book<00:02:32.930> 1<00:02:33.200> book<00:02:33.230> 2<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.769> book<00:02:34.099> 3

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
them so this is book 1 book 2 and book 3

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.759 
them so this is book 1 book 2 and book 3
will<00:02:34.489> be<00:02:34.640> coming<00:02:35.060> soon<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.660> then<00:02:36.349> once<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.709> get

will be coming soon and then once I get

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.740 
will be coming soon and then once I get
a<00:02:36.920> completely<00:02:37.370> built<00:02:37.610> I'll<00:02:37.819> do<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.299> complete

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
a completely built I'll do a complete

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.780 
a completely built I'll do a complete
review<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.680> that's<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.340> for<00:02:40.519> now<00:02:40.610> guys
