00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
fight for a spot on the roster I think

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.149

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
and then preseason is all of februari so

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.310 
and then preseason is all of februari so
I<00:00:33.400> think<00:00:33.670> what<00:00:33.940> I<00:00:33.970> read<00:00:34.240> was<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:35.110> team

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
I think what I read was that the team

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.800 
I think what I read was that the team
leaves<00:00:35.590> for<00:00:35.800> Las<00:00:35.950> Vegas<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:36.760> think<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.300> end<00:00:37.630> of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
leaves for Las Vegas I think the end of

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.510 
leaves for Las Vegas I think the end of
the<00:00:37.870> first<00:00:38.050> week<00:00:38.260> of<00:00:38.350> februari<00:00:38.740> and<00:00:38.920> they<00:00:39.340> go
