is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.610 
is
your<00:02:22.090> middle<00:02:22.390> linebacker<00:02:22.750> too<00:02:23.110> much<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
your middle linebacker too much to the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.290 
your middle linebacker too much to the
right<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.610> your<00:02:24.700> middle<00:02:24.880> linebacker

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
right and your middle linebacker

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.000 
right and your middle linebacker
defensive<00:02:25.960> tackle<00:02:26.290> too<00:02:26.470> much<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.890> left

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
defensive tackle too much to the left

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
defensive tackle too much to the left
and<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:28.090> kind<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.390> leaves<00:02:28.540> like<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> big<00:02:29.020> open

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and that kind of leaves like a big open

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.010 
and that kind of leaves like a big open
lane<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:31.030> blocker<00:02:31.330> actually<00:02:31.720> blocks

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
lane and the blocker actually blocks

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.840 
lane and the blocker actually blocks
your<00:02:32.260> middle<00:02:32.500> linebacker<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:33.700> your

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
your middle linebacker and then your

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.030 
your middle linebacker and then your
defensive<00:02:34.330> tackle<00:02:34.660> has<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.080> tackle<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
defensive tackle has to tackle the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.650 
defensive tackle has to tackle the
running<00:02:36.400> back<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.090> not<00:02:37.210> want<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.510> go

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
running back so you do not want to go

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.540 
running back so you do not want to go
too<00:02:37.720> far<00:02:38.260> away<00:02:38.320> from<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.100> middle<00:02:39.280> you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
too far away from the middle you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.250 
too far away from the middle you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
probably want to stay between the dotted

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.630 
probably want to stay between the dotted
lines<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.620> I'll<00:02:41.680> go<00:02:41.800> ahead<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.130> show<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.310> one

these two low overall players and yeah

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.820 
these two low overall players and yeah
so<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.190> combine<00:03:10.060> NFL<00:03:10.540> Combine<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.530> three

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
so this combine NFL Combine the three

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.590 
so this combine NFL Combine the three
first<00:03:12.070> Collectibles<00:03:12.640> are<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:12.970> tough<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.420> get

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
first Collectibles are so tough to get

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.690 
first Collectibles are so tough to get
and<00:03:13.930> hopefully<00:03:14.800> we<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.070> get<00:03:15.250> them<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.580> in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
and hopefully we can get them in the in

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.210 
and hopefully we can get them in the in
one<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.090> these<00:03:16.180> two<00:03:16.420> packs<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.500> think<00:03:18.070> it's

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
one of these two packs so I think it's

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.930 
one of these two packs so I think it's
40-yard<00:03:18.820> dash<00:03:18.960> 20-yard<00:03:19.960> shuttle<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.590> 60<00:03:21.280> yard

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
40-yard dash 20-yard shuttle and 60 yard

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.760
