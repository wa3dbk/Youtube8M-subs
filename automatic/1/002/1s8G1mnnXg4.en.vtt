preview<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.540> upcoming<00:00:04.220> algebra<00:00:05.220> touch

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
preview of the upcoming algebra touch

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.259 
preview of the upcoming algebra touch
update<00:00:06.020> the<00:00:07.020> key<00:00:07.230> new<00:00:07.379> features<00:00:07.770> are

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
update the key new features are

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.390 
update the key new features are
distribution<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.570> factoring<00:00:09.990> app<00:00:10.340> so<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
distribution and factoring app so to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.740 
distribution and factoring app so to
distribute<00:00:12.830> tap<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> x<00:00:14.250> side<00:00:14.750> connects

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
distribute tap on the x side connects

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.340 
distribute tap on the x side connects
the<00:00:15.929> lines<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:17.930> bring<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> term<00:00:19.320> across

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
the lines and then bring the term across

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
the lines and then bring the term across
to<00:00:22.350> factor<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> back<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:24.060> could<00:00:24.269> pick<00:00:24.539> up

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
to factor it back out to could pick up

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.939 
to factor it back out to could pick up
the<00:00:24.750> term<00:00:24.960> match<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:26.180> there<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> go<00:00:27.949> smaller

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the term match it there you go smaller

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.560 
the term match it there you go smaller
new<00:00:29.189> feature<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.000> pick<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.300> whole

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
new feature is you can pick up whole

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.459 
new feature is you can pick up whole
sums<00:00:30.929> now<00:00:31.550> or<00:00:32.550> even<00:00:32.960> products<00:00:34.640> alright<00:00:36.469> nice

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
sums now or even products alright nice

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.619 
sums now or even products alright nice
nice<00:00:38.309> part<00:00:38.610> about<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> scales

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
nice part about this is that it scales

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
nice part about this is that it scales
up<00:00:39.870> pretty<00:00:40.110> well<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.829> doesn't<00:00:41.430> matter<00:00:41.550> how

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
up pretty well so doesn't matter how

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.930 
up pretty well so doesn't matter how
many<00:00:41.820> terms<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:44.370> bring<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.789> all

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
many terms you have you bring them all

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
many terms you have you bring them all
across<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> same<00:00:45.930> action<00:00:48.079> this<00:00:49.079> enables

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
across in the same action this enables

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
across in the same action this enables
us<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> solve<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:51.210> bigger<00:00:51.660> problems<00:00:53.300> another

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
us to solve much bigger problems another

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.889 
us to solve much bigger problems another
new<00:00:54.420> feature<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.820> can<00:00:56.820> scroll<00:00:57.420> using

new feature is that you can scroll using

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.770 
new feature is that you can scroll using
two<00:00:58.050> fingers<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> no<00:01:00.149> matter<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.480> big<00:01:00.690> the

problem<00:01:07.850> mmm<00:01:09.229> bring<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.350> across<00:01:11.510> no<00:01:12.510> that's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
problem mmm bring this across no that's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
problem mmm bring this across no that's
not<00:01:12.960> helpful<00:01:14.509> what<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.409> pull<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
not helpful what if we pull out the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.630 
not helpful what if we pull out the
eight<00:01:20.570> okay<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> eliminate<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:24.680> nice<00:01:25.680> nice

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
eight okay we can eliminate it nice nice

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780 
eight okay we can eliminate it nice nice
all<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.420> well<00:01:28.130> let's<00:01:29.130> distribute<00:01:29.460> here

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
all right well let's distribute here

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.510 
all right well let's distribute here
because<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.210> access<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.900> X<00:01:33.170> okay

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
because I want access to that X okay

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.830 
because I want access to that X okay
distribute<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.710> nice<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.689> need

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
distribute it nice all right now we need

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.429 
distribute it nice all right now we need
to<00:01:39.900> isolate<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.470> variable<00:01:43.220> simplify<00:01:45.259> see<00:01:46.259> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
to isolate the variable simplify see you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.429 
to isolate the variable simplify see you
know<00:01:46.579> up<00:01:47.579> order<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> operations<00:01:48.439> multiply

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
know up order of operations multiply

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.610 
know up order of operations multiply
first<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:50.970> add

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
first then we add

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.090 
first then we add
final<00:01:53.400> isolation<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.350> big<00:01:55.530> mess<00:01:55.830> was

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
final isolation now that big mess was

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
final isolation now that big mess was
just<00:01:56.430> x<00:01:56.730> equals<00:01:57.090> 1<00:01:57.890> alright<00:01:58.890> cool<00:01:59.070> thanks
