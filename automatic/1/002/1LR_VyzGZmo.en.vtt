00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
used a lot of goddamn cannonballs

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.839 
used a lot of goddamn cannonballs
I'm<00:06:29.289> probably<00:06:29.680> gonna<00:06:29.889> try<00:06:30.129> and<00:06:30.250> attack<00:06:30.550> soon

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849

like<00:06:31.270> like<00:06:31.659> 75<00:06:32.229> or<00:06:32.469> so<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:32.860> I<00:06:33.310> might<00:06:34.150> have<00:06:34.360> to

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
like like 75 or so and I might have to

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:35.760 
like like 75 or so and I might have to
train<00:06:34.719> defense<00:06:35.050> just<00:06:35.169> for<00:06:35.349> the<00:06:35.409> simple<00:06:35.709> fact

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
train defense just for the simple fact

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.010 
train defense just for the simple fact
that<00:06:36.069> I<00:06:36.219> want<00:06:36.880> to<00:06:36.940> get<00:06:37.029> my<00:06:37.120> combat<00:06:37.509> to<00:06:37.599> 100<00:06:37.930> as

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
that I want to get my combat to 100 as

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.760 
that I want to get my combat to 100 as
soon<00:06:38.199> as<00:06:38.319> they<00:06:38.409> can

soon as they can

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.020 
soon as they can
it's<00:06:38.979> 83<00:06:39.310> for<00:06:39.610> now<00:06:39.699> just<00:06:39.909> quite<00:06:40.089> good

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
it's 83 for now just quite good

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.550 
it's 83 for now just quite good
17:17<00:06:43.030> levels<00:06:43.360> that's<00:06:43.450> so<00:06:43.630> far<00:06:43.870> away<00:06:43.930> I'm<00:06:44.320> like

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
17:17 levels that's so far away I'm like

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.230 
17:17 levels that's so far away I'm like
90<00:06:44.950> strength<00:06:45.280> before<00:06:45.610> I<00:06:45.640> even<00:06:45.760> get<00:06:45.910> close<00:06:46.180> to

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
90 strength before I even get close to

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.960 
90 strength before I even get close to
100<00:06:46.690> combat<00:06:46.870> I<00:06:47.080> think<00:06:47.350> oh<00:06:47.590> this<00:06:48.400> is<00:06:48.550> one<00:06:48.730> thing

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
100 combat I think oh this is one thing

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.280 
100 combat I think oh this is one thing
by<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.180> way<00:06:49.330> you<00:06:49.630> got<00:06:49.780> to<00:06:49.900> pick<00:06:50.050> up<00:06:50.140> your

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
by the way you got to pick up your

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.900 
by the way you got to pick up your
cannon<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:50.980> because<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:51.670> thing<00:06:51.880> this

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
cannon and because this thing this

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.160 
cannon and because this thing this
cannon<00:06:52.390> does<00:06:52.510> not<00:06:52.630> actually<00:06:52.780> give<00:06:52.990> you<00:06:53.140> a

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
cannon does not actually give you a

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.450 
cannon does not actually give you a
message<00:06:53.380> I've<00:06:53.620> spent<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:53.980> case<00:06:54.160> you<00:06:54.370> know
