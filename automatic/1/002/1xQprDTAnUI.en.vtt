00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
and it's really healthy that over the

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.489 
and it's really healthy that over the
years<00:00:41.469> so<00:00:42.249> many<00:00:42.399> students<00:00:43.089> are<00:00:43.230> becoming<00:00:44.230> more

turn on the drum machine and we'll just

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.349 
turn on the drum machine and we'll just
start<00:00:59.379> creating<00:00:59.679> grooves<00:01:00.159> and<00:01:00.489> we'll<00:01:01.120> talk

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
start creating grooves and we'll talk

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.989 
start creating grooves and we'll talk
about<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.920> theory<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.399> arranging

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
about the the theory of arranging

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.420 
about the the theory of arranging
basically<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.870> know<00:01:05.019> one<00:01:05.770> guy<00:01:05.950> will<00:01:06.220> play<00:01:06.400> a

basically you know one guy will play a

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.100 
basically you know one guy will play a
low<00:01:06.729> part<00:01:07.000> another<00:01:07.300> guy<00:01:07.570> will<00:01:07.690> play<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.870> high

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
low part another guy will play a high

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.170 
low part another guy will play a high
part<00:01:08.469> and<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:09.070> try<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.310> make<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.640> parts<00:01:09.909> work

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
part and we try to make the parts work

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.280 
part and we try to make the parts work
because<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:11.590> can<00:01:12.130> teach<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.659> any<00:01:13.659> number<00:01:14.259> of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
because I can teach you any number of

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.200 
because I can teach you any number of
guitar<00:01:14.680> parts<00:01:14.979> from<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.219> James<00:01:15.430> Brown<00:01:15.759> record

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.069 
guitar parts from a James Brown record
Earth<00:01:16.360> Wind<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.780> Fire<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.700> real

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
Earth Wind and Fire but the real

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.569 
Earth Wind and Fire but the real
important<00:01:20.079> education<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.159> learn<00:01:21.310> how<00:01:21.369> to

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
important education is to learn how to

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.810 
important education is to learn how to
create<00:01:21.820> those<00:01:22.030> parts<00:01:22.390> yourself<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.820> it's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
create those parts yourself so it's

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.940 
create those parts yourself so it's
great<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.329> see<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.630> students<00:01:25.990> want<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.710> do

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
great to see the students want to do

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.789 
great to see the students want to do
that<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:27.430> not<00:01:27.789> just<00:01:28.479> worry<00:01:28.719> about<00:01:28.780> what<00:01:29.350> scale

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
that and not just worry about what scale

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.180 
that and not just worry about what scale
to<00:01:29.950> play<00:01:30.130> /<00:01:30.340> e<00:01:30.520> seven<00:01:30.909> sharp<00:01:31.299> 11<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.869> know

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.460 

yeah<00:01:36.290> well<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.830> if<00:01:38.190> we're<00:01:38.610> playing<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
yeah well if we're if we're playing a

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:50.090 
yeah well if we're if we're playing a
like<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> groove<00:01:41.370> in<00:01:41.550> D<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.830> that's<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
like just a groove in D so if that's the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.440 
like just a groove in D so if that's the
basic<00:01:50.550> groove<00:01:52.670> maybe<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> keyboard<00:01:54.210> player

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
basic groove maybe the keyboard player

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
basic groove maybe the keyboard player
is<00:01:54.660> playing<00:01:54.960> something<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.190> try

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
is playing something like that and I try

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
to tell them that maybe if that's it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.690 
to tell them that maybe if that's it
maybe<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.730> have<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:06.800> or<00:02:07.800> if<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
maybe all you have to do is it or if the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.030 
maybe all you have to do is it or if the
range<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.350> guitar<00:02:10.649> player<00:02:10.950> if

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
range of the of the guitar player if

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.440 
range of the of the guitar player if
there's<00:02:11.220> two<00:02:11.370> guitar<00:02:11.700> players<00:02:11.730> maybe<00:02:12.270> the
