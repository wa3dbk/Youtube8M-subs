this<00:01:52.799> time<00:01:53.040> probably<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:53.970> year<00:01:54.479> when

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this time probably not this year when

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.969 
this time probably not this year when
I'm<00:01:54.810> trying<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.259> hundred<00:01:55.680> books<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
year because this will slow me down a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
year because this will slow me down a
lot<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> list<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.850> next

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
lot but it can be on the list for next

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
lot but it can be on the list for next
year<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.049> girl<00:02:01.290> called<00:02:01.590> Lucy
