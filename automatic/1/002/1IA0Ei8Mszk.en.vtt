00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 they are small protrusions 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.000
 of this button no 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.299
 but right on these montalto protrusions 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.029
 our small button 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.369
 just to insert two cuts in these two protrusions 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.739
 small side babies 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.870
 I show 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.929
 it focuses 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.349
 there is a pair of 40 liutenant so these two sizes must be inserted 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.349
 so you tell me in these two protrusions 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.120
 yes you can see yes 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.810
 when I insert cossiga inserted well 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.850
 so it goes really high in line with the top 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.320
 while at the bottom of the there is some space 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.590
 so we can think then also in this case 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 remove the double-sided tape protection 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.290
 no attack I repeat several times because 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.850
 not even really bothered about it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.260
 we remove the protection 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.370
 and let's position it 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.050
 as it should be 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 I approach maybe hoping that you see better 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.590
 here it is 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.430
 we place it on intuition 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.940
 here it is 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 we reject to make sure that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 gripping tape 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 this 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.650
 is the button 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.760
 body 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.900
 review 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.460
 I sign with elvira live to show that I entered here 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.980
 here the two notches 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.930
 here it is supplied necklaces 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.980
 both here and here your notch of the power button shackle kept 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.150
 pressed over 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.009
 even here you see it comes out of the plastic 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.240
 also ansa.it I of you 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.100
 italian gold with cutter after a couple of photos 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.440
 bike so that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 disappears need not remain this thing 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.270
 here we have composed our yes 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.700
 failed to come up with support to wonder why 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 this one that holds the switch instead 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.110
 dib the silent mute action and this one again 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.650
 instead of the ignition one 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.989
 we can fly now go 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.220
 to mount it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.220
 I'm at your brand new cover 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.059
 how this circuit is assembled 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.059
 the operation is not simple but neither 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.629
 impossible ooh complicated 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.319
 liked we put 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.319
 this here that would be the attack of the smurfs 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.939
 added 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939
 in this channel there is via ticino 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.079
 in the antenna you can do 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 see where this is pointing with the screwdriver 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.069
 there is a groove 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.629
 here in the bowels of our earth 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.799
 non stop with headphones 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.229
 so let's take 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.569
 we insert this unknown 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.419
 let's slide it 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.280
 I love you if you can see it 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.729
 here it is 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.949
 slipping until he goes to fight 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.189
 with support 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.879
 that we have the first 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.349
 here come in see 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.349
 Headset attack entered and now here 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.659
 immediately 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.000
 solar panels te 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.310
 longer than we have of all 21 to the iPhone screws 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.790
 which is given in the throat with or you can buy separately then 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.939
 fix 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.439
 the headphone connection 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.429
 with life 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.799
 with this pilu screw 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.759
 th 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.779
 toca now then pass admit 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.779
 the switch 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.019
 many silent radios 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.299
 passed under connector number 6 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.879
 close the origins descansar the comment of Berlusconi because 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.879
 problematic this positioned back 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.769
 then crap brought slowly 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.939
 the commutator number 6 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.939
 in position 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.539
 here it is quiiii 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.539
 pasta that this part here 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.099
 let's see if you see the video of the switch 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.699
 from above these lives 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.129
 here is a hole 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.460
 must match the other hole in the switch 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.460
 and then 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.960
 also on the other side of the mate 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 with the other part the task of mathematics 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.180
 here we are in position with commutator 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.849
 I also advise you to do the test 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.629
 front button cityville that operates 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.200
 claudio on mute 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 they fit well with flaps then 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.400
 select no 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.789
 mine is crazy or you porn 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.089
 which here hahaha at this point 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.939
 you can put 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.719
 this other part that does just above 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.199
 this world is full of what keeps the volume keys affirmed 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.370
 that is 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.909
 cretienne the little buttons 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.909
 filme del commutatore Here there are three powder screws mounted on one here do not open 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:19.889
 one here 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.110
 to fix it 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.370
 on the chrome frame 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.960
 finally and now it is not that he did not win but 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.249
 a suggestion of destroyed 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.249
 instructions must be mounted this that 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.080
 our a power button 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.080
 remember - he made aosta colored frame 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.210
 there are two fingers 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.740
 text indicating stuffed rabbit 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.050
 and here too we have two 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.930
 painted these two points 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.750
 they did it right 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.770
 match 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.199
 with those of the monster 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.559
 button 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.259
 here it fits so 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.800
 that are made to put here the two screws 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.729
 ketter pushed the power button here text 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.900
 there is no front part because it doesn't always come out 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.530
 the little button it takes to turn on and off 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:14.990
 but 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.559
 and in this world that he put in position 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.189
 what is the function of this part the classic is not just that it takes 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.419
 thrust 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.659
 pushed the power button but then that too 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.189
 hahaha through this little ledge we have here 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.689
 of the plastic I take it out of the smith to see better 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.599
 this small ledge that is here 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:42.569
 need 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.220
 wait sherm to our motherboard because it was chasing downstairs 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:48.979
 this naturae scale 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.219
 of the button 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:51.839
 via cc 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.449
 not the one in this movie we saw 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:55.909
 starting from scratch 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.909
 how to put the volume buttons 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.840
 write on a cover as you then add the chrome frame 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.229
 then it is added on 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.270
 port 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.580
 for the camera here 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.529
 forlan tennant you want to do 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.110
 then we saw how it is 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.990
 you put on the part here that you need to stay there infodent 

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:22.899
 and then we mounted 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:25.430
 very complex circuit 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.210
 headphones 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.830
 ie power button 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.990
 volume switch buttons 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.990
 silent or no regret 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.430
 explained how to put them 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.669
 inside the cover there is therefore how it should be reassembled 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:43.899
 this circuit 

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:46.119
 other explanations will follow 

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:49.559
 further on how to continue to mount 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.509
 the other karma pieces 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:55.310
 a greeting to all from von assist
