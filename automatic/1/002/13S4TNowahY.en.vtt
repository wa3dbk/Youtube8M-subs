00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 the eta q I will explain how you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.429
 turns a computer source into a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.030
 source for xbox 360 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.839
 I have a jasper model, right? 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.840
 yesterday I went to play and who dies the source 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.840
 who spoke of nothing worked such a game 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.120
 and here is source 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:39.660
 and open is not what I did I took the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.309
 main cable he does not want to use 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 this source because it is not much 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.720
 good is not 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.809
 he comes back and sometimes it takes 221 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.500
 Then I did the following I picked up the source 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.710
 normal to common tx 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.960
 there you do the following you do not disassemble 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:07.620
 the main part of it left intact 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:13.460
 You are and you do not have to move her to participate. 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:16.890
 also from the source is to use only the same wiring 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.299
 it's very simple inside the end of xbox is 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:26.610
 is the cable has yellow the blue and the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.340
 right red and will have black and they 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.470
 correspond to the same source voltage 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.850
 computer understood that yellow 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.270
 corresponds to 12 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 black is the neutron the red is the 5 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.900
 and in this case you will not use that it is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.570
 videogame automatic you 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.570
 connect will not need 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.150
 I did the following here and I cut the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.610
 I put it here I am from within 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.500
 right here since I isolated lack now make 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.070
 this red here and then you 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.960
 make the solder you insulate 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 Just like that, the way you do it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 find it better 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.780
 I thought it best to keep this in here. 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.510
 head had inside the source 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.220
 Okay, I 'll close it later and stay 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.239
 everything cute will be left out only the wire 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:27.330
 here as if it were his original 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.709
 it 's just a really cool thing and the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.030
 What you need to do for this source 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.160
 able to function properly because 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.540
 it does not have automatic activation 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.269
 You'll need to make this drive. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.000
 manual and that I have already lost 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.100
 You come here you see that you only have one cable 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 green had a single green 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940
 you will see if you see any black on 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.989
 case of the closest black that is the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.880
 I put the game on the side 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:59.640
 which means it's a piece of tin 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.650
 of the same sun in what you put there 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.049
 you see the source in the socket it goes 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.680
 send energy and will transfer the 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:12.269
 green cable chain a new car 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.000
 official xbox 70 we will finish the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.200
 and we'll see how it goes. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.200
 running june
