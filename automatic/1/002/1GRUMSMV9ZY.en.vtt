00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
it to make sure that this is on top and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.900 
it to make sure that this is on top and
then<00:02:55.580> we<00:02:55.760> take<00:02:55.940> some<00:02:56.660> rope<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.460> push<00:02:58.460> it<00:02:58.640> to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
then we take some rope and push it to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.710 
then we take some rope and push it to
the<00:02:59.240> holes<00:02:59.630> now<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.680> make<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> knot<00:03:04.720> I'm

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
the holes now and you make a knot I'm

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.420 
the holes now and you make a knot I'm
not<00:03:06.110> on<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.830> rope<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:08.570> know<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.190> arm

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
not on the rope so you know so the arm

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.690 
not on the rope so you know so the arm
so<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.410> Rope<00:03:12.590> won't<00:03:12.800> go<00:03:13.010> through<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.460> hole

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
so so the Rope won't go through the hole

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.790 
so so the Rope won't go through the hole
and<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:15.940> tie<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.720> okay<00:03:17.960> you<00:03:18.020> make<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.350> loop

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
and you tie it you okay you make a loop

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.280 
and you tie it you okay you make a loop
like<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.300> take<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.570> end<00:03:20.960> part

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
like that and you take the end part

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.340 
like that and you take the end part
that's<00:03:21.620> sticking<00:03:21.920> out<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.780> put<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.930> through

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
that's sticking out and put it through

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.140 
that's sticking out and put it through
the<00:03:24.820> hole<00:03:26.140> then<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.320> tie<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.520> that<00:03:28.910> or

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
the hole then you tie it like that or

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.500 
the hole then you tie it like that or
you<00:03:29.570> can<00:03:29.720> tie<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:29.990> like<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:30.980> then<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:32.300> have

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
you can tie it like that then you have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.750 
you can tie it like that then you have
one<00:03:32.810> knot<00:03:33.080> right<00:03:33.320> there<00:03:34.840> nice<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:35.870> good<00:03:36.760> then

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
one knot right there nice and good then

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.810 
one knot right there nice and good then
you<00:03:37.850> take<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.090> other<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.630> push<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.320> through

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
you take the other and push it through

then it's time for the two pieces of

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.610 
then it's time for the two pieces of
wire<00:04:16.200> mesh<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:17.450> want<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.570> lie<00:04:18.720> down<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.500> me

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
wire mesh I want to lie down so for me

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.740 
wire mesh I want to lie down so for me
easier<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.430> need<00:04:20.700> some<00:04:20.850> help<00:04:21.000> from<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
easier and I need some help from the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.170 
easier and I need some help from the
helping<00:04:22.290> hand<00:04:23.450> which<00:04:24.450> we'll<00:04:24.690> staple<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.350> down

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:43.610 

that's<00:04:30.180> one<00:04:33.140> two<00:04:37.520> three<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.860> four<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.620> then

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
that's one two three and four and then

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.159 
that's one two three and four and then
you<00:04:43.830> do<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.040> off<00:04:44.610> same<00:04:45.240> thing<00:04:45.480> on<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.720> outside

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
you do it off same thing on the outside

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.470 
you do it off same thing on the outside
but<00:04:46.320> there's<00:04:46.560> only<00:04:46.740> one<00:04:47.070> difference<00:04:47.480> you

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
but there's only one difference you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.680 
but there's only one difference you
don't<00:04:49.470> staple<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.730> one<00:04:51.030> side<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.540> can

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
don't staple it on one side so you can

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:00.890 
don't staple it on one side so you can
put<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.560> suit<00:04:52.890> in<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:55.050> now<00:04:59.419> and<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.540> guess<00:05:00.750> the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
put the suit in and now and I guess the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.990 
put the suit in and now and I guess the
top<00:05:01.140> part<00:05:01.500> will<00:05:01.740> be<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.160> part<00:05:02.400> where<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:02.730> put

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
top part will be the part where you put

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.760 
top part will be the part where you put
suet<00:05:03.419> in<00:05:05.630> rocks<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.340> then<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:09.120> take<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:11.610> wire

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
suet in rocks and then you take the wire

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.740 
suet in rocks and then you take the wire
you<00:05:14.330> push<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.680> through<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:17.180> wire<00:05:18.180> mesh<00:05:18.570> is

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
you push it through the wire mesh is

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:28.420 
you push it through the wire mesh is
pulled<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:22.669> then<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:26.310> take<00:05:26.580> both<00:05:26.910> ends<00:05:27.540> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
pulled and then you take both ends and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.540 
pulled and then you take both ends and
tie<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:30.229> so<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.320> can<00:05:31.590> close<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.070> other<00:05:32.250> end

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.749 

and<00:05:37.550> then<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.569> hang<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:38.990> on<00:05:39.139> a<00:05:39.169> tree<00:05:39.680> which<00:05:40.580> I

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
and then you hang it on a tree which I

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:50.710 
and then you hang it on a tree which I
will<00:05:40.970> do<00:05:41.750> soon<00:05:42.350> after<00:05:43.190> i<00:05:44.139> am<00:05:45.139> done<00:05:45.349> tying<00:05:49.720> ok

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
will do soon after i am done tying ok

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:09.360 
will do soon after i am done tying ok
now<00:05:50.990> let's<00:05:51.020> put<00:05:51.650> this<00:05:51.860> on<00:05:52.069> a<00:05:52.099> tree

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:17.380 

then<00:06:11.980> go<00:06:12.980> find<00:06:13.430> extreme<00:06:15.970> around<00:06:16.970> your<00:06:17.180> house

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
then go find extreme around your house

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:24.010 
then go find extreme around your house
and<00:06:17.780> then<00:06:19.690> you<00:06:20.690> hang<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:21.380> up<00:06:21.560> and<00:06:22.300> that<00:06:23.300> way<00:06:23.690> I'm

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
and then you hang it up and that way I'm

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.710 
and then you hang it up and that way I'm
going<00:06:24.290> to<00:06:24.350> put<00:06:24.530> on<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:24.740> higher<00:06:25.010> branch<00:06:25.510> hang<00:06:26.510> it

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
going to put on a higher branch hang it

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.740 
going to put on a higher branch hang it
up<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:27.260> then<00:06:27.920> there<00:06:28.490> you<00:06:28.640> go<00:06:28.670> you<00:06:29.270> have<00:06:29.300> a<00:06:29.450> bird

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
up and then there you go you have a bird

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.050 
up and then there you go you have a bird
feeder
