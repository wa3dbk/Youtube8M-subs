on the left of the lower molar number 19

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.030 
on the left of the lower molar number 19
is<00:01:17.670> missing<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.350> row<00:01:19.530> tips<00:01:19.799> are<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.689> of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
other lateral 10 and 11 now she has had

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.100 
other lateral 10 and 11 now she has had
in<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> past<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.250> partial<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:31.189> has<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:33.079> been<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
in the past a partial that has a been a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.480 
in the past a partial that has a been a
temporary<00:01:34.680> paint<00:01:34.890> partial<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.340> she<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
temporary paint partial but she just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.109 
temporary paint partial but she just
used<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:39.500> regular<00:01:40.500> partial<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
used it as a regular partial and the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
used it as a regular partial and the
problem<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> use<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
problem with that is when you use a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.039 
problem with that is when you use a
temporary<00:01:44.520> partial<00:01:44.939> long-term<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
temporary partial long-term and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
temporary partial long-term and
oftentimes<00:01:46.439> loosens<00:01:47.280> teeth<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.090> it's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
oftentimes loosens teeth because it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
oftentimes loosens teeth because it's
not<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.450> correctly<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.890> what's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
not in correctly and that's what's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
not in correctly and that's what's
happened<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> patient<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.509> see

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
happened to this patient you can see

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.990 
happened to this patient you can see
where<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.740> metal<00:01:55.979> clasp<00:01:56.520> on

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
where there's the little metal clasp on

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
where there's the little metal clasp on
the<00:01:57.149> left<00:01:57.530> go<00:01:58.530> back

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
and there's a metal clasp here this

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.740 
and there's a metal clasp here this
tooth<00:02:12.220> here<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.940> falling<00:02:13.840> off<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
tooth here is falling off because the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.860 
tooth here is falling off because the
part<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> tooth<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:17.980> fractured<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:24.870> when

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
part of the tooth is fractured and when

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.280 
part of the tooth is fractured and when
she<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.120> see<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.300> loose<00:02:28.630> piece<00:02:28.930> that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
she you can see that loose piece that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.660 
she you can see that loose piece that
comes<00:02:29.500> off<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.530> roots<00:02:32.770> broken<00:02:33.520> all<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
comes off and the roots broken all the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
way down to the gum line there's just a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.170 
way down to the gum line there's just a
close<00:02:40.180> up<00:02:40.480> inside<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:43.270> my<00:02:43.720> ability<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.350> get

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
close up inside here my ability to get

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.310 
close up inside here my ability to get
closer<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:48.220> see<00:02:48.780> parts<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.080> right

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
closer and you can see parts of it right

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.170 
closer and you can see parts of it right
there<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.800> were<00:02:50.980> broken<00:02:51.370> off<00:02:51.700> but<00:02:52.030> she

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
there that were broken off but she

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.680 
there that were broken off but she
really<00:02:52.360> didn't<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.780> much<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:54.180> top<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.450> that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
really didn't have much of a top of that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.580 
really didn't have much of a top of that
tooth<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.470> began<00:02:56.770> with

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.140

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
spot there there's the post that was

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.530 
spot there there's the post that was
inside<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.650> tooth<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:14.000> as<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.209> move<00:03:15.420> along

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
inside the tooth and as we move along

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.100 
inside the tooth and as we move along
this<00:03:16.349> is<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> temporary<00:03:17.129> partial<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:19.019> you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
this is the temporary partial and you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.589 
this is the temporary partial and you
can<00:03:19.230> see<00:03:19.379> the<00:03:19.409> plastic<00:03:20.220> when<00:03:20.849> she<00:03:20.970> bites<00:03:21.239> down

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
can see the plastic when she bites down

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.899 
can see the plastic when she bites down
this<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.349> pushes<00:03:22.769> against<00:03:23.099> this<00:03:23.400> canine

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
this actually pushes against this canine

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.610 
this actually pushes against this canine
and<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.299> canine<00:03:24.750> actually<00:03:25.260> has<00:03:25.349> become

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and that canine actually has become

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:50.990 
and that canine actually has become
loose<00:03:25.920> because<00:03:26.189> of<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:27.799> and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
see that we're on RT you'll see this one

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:02.090 
see that we're on RT you'll see this one
back<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.400> forth<00:03:56.840> they're<00:03:57.840> loose<00:03:58.200> and<00:04:01.100> that

partial sink into the tissue more right
here<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:41.069> it's<00:05:41.639> putting<00:05:41.940> pressure<00:05:42.449> on<00:05:42.840> all

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
here and it's putting pressure on all
