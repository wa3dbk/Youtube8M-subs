00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi people just turn on many rechargeable batteries 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.740
 the iphone 5s and iphone 5 c 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.360
 presented and of course there are 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 he also wants to be the same as before 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 a little bit about touch id 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.289
 or the fingerprint scanner 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.480
 the as expected in the iphone 5 s to find 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.100
 is how he works what he can and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.980
 which technology is behind this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 I tell you a lot of fun now 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.400
 as already expected it will be the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.349
 fingerprint scanner in the home button and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.939
 around the homebutton go around this 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 nice things if you ask me 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.260
 really somehow looks extremely good 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.640
 is part of it and we look at it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.460
 Construction is what it is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.410
 have a total of four parts at the bottom 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.020
 we one day again partly whittaker 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.899
 because of too much how tangible then comes the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.149
 touch sensor a stainless steel the bags 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.700
 Ring and then a laser cut of the celebration 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.070
 crystal ball crystal is the second 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140
 Hardest material in the world and can only 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 with a diamond means sexual 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.199
 if you can play around with it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 Do not happen again unless you throw 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.219
 so that their banks use the room 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.890
 important thing in the matter is of course 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.350
 touch sensor and that is only in 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 single steps 170 microns bin 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.590
 micrometers that are 0,001 millimeters and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.770
 we have 170 of them 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.560
 resolution is 500 pixels per inch 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.650
 money also the lower layers of the skin and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.110
 that is 360 degrees readable that is 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 no matter how you put your finger on it 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 turns it should be recognized why 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.799
 A fingerprint scanner annoys people 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.200
 it has to enter your pin or is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.850
 It's not that cool at all 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 the thing is how it does not matter 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.090
 But all apple users will be there before 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.890
 you know that you want an app 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.000
 download and then you have to constantly 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 enter the password 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 You can only do this through 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.280
 replace this fingerprint 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.420
 also means in apps is the whole then 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.220
 possible to use 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 of course important in the app store for 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.020
 Buy lasting itunes for example the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.540
 I think that's an extremely good thing 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.619
 thoughtfully designed apple and that was it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.060
 Actually you already have to see 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 how that works as it's built 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.520
 is and for what that is good all in all 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 not that uninteresting of course 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.979
 no new feature you already know it 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.760
 from the motorola atrix or war but well 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.680
 that's the fingerprint 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.939
 So I wanted to explain it to you 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 I hope you have a little something 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.110
 learned at this time
