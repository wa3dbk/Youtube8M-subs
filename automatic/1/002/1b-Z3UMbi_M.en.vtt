00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.499
 hello in this lesson we will 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.979
 to create such silhouettes 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.799
 it will remain 2 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.609
 I have thrown out of the poultice collection 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.640
 I am temporarily red for him 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880
 our object is locked 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.230
 another at the bottom of the page prepared 2 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320
 rectangles externally rectangle 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.419
 3 mm high upper 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.980
 rectangle 1 mm high 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.370
 both of these rectangles 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.260
 filled with black paint address them 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.410
 absent 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.570
 Apply the effect to these two objects. 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.570
 interactive flowing 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 number of steps for transition 150 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.470
 we got a group 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.720
 overflow effect 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.580
 according to this group 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.820
 and suddenly a hero 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.080
 objects obtained as a result of actions 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.470
 effect 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.750
 now we have succeeded 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 our totality 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.579
 united them 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.180
 new object 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.610
 we got a single curve 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.140
 now we only need 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.170
 unlock all our objects 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.490
 and combine 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.060
 nature obtained our strength 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.440
 when combined 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.270
 individual properties of an object 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.120
 is lost 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.290
 and areas to common for these two objects 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 become transparent 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 we got such silhouettes and drawing 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.860
 we can put some kind of fund under 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.190
 neva and see how our change 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 amount 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 at any time we can repaint our 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.720
 we got one of the variations of it all 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.090
 pattern 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.710
 another kind of power 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 of this drawing we will build have those 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.610
 the same blanks we also have the power 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.810
 the curve is plotted as a result of the action 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.270
 spillover effect 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.480
 apply the tool to it 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 interactive distortion 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.179
 now choose tool inset 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 and cut off all the excess 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.409
 standards our objects 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.829
 and the resulting two objects combined 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.829
 using the intersection function 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.969
 as a result of the actions of this function we have 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.189
 formed a new object which appeared 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.859
 aggregate about common areas and our two 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.069
 of objects 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.469
 change the position of this object is not 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.469
 let's get such a silhouette drawing 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.669
 the reception of creating this whole picture is possible 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.809
 use and to get different 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.189
 sort of interesting text effects 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.089
 for example such are compatible 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.010
 concentric circles 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.999
 converted to a single curve senior 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.199
 single object 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.199
 Litex 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.469
 compatible two objects using the function 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.399
 intersection 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.589
 remove all unnecessary 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.589
 and get from such an interesting text 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.899
 if this text is applied 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.109
 various interactive 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.859
 effects for example 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.709
 overflow 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.709
 and only 7 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.429
 extrusion 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.129
 then we will get the whole set 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.509
 interesting text effects 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:41.979
 as a village it can be 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.519
 used drawn by 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.569
 photography vector object 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.909
 and the reception of this whole picture can be 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.079
 used in the design of the fragment 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:50.829
