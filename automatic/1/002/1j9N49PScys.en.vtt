 antitank variant of this I have all 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 I decided to use the horna shooters 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 although the price-quality is consistent 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.480

 z5 at just 180 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.170
 kilometers per hour but in general 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.590
 enough further with regard to support 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 support i use from artillery given 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.720
 why him a chair because first of all 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.490
 the characteristics of the main instrument we 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.829

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.740

 intelligence we have the best infantry here 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.560

 rifle 45 i.e. 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.640
 occasions the price seems quite 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.940
 corresponds to the floating here 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.709
 at the door of an armed tour it is quite and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.600

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.989
 also here you can take for example 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.600
 helicopters but it's in any way falcons for 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.140
 deployment good strong helicopters 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.440
