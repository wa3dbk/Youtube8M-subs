00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this head was kind of the brainchild of

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530 
this head was kind of the brainchild of
me<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.110> Marshall<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.530> course<00:01:05.770> but<00:01:06.540> came

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
me and Marshall of course but came

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.480 
me and Marshall of course but came
around<00:01:07.780> from<00:01:07.990> this<00:01:08.200> one<00:01:08.410> head<00:01:08.650> that<00:01:09.160> I<00:01:09.250> still

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
around from this one head that I still

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.980 
around from this one head that I still
have<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.150> got<00:01:10.390> Jim<00:01:10.570> Marshall<00:01:10.780> to

I've had it you know I've been using my

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.120 
I've had it you know I've been using my
stage<00:01:20.560> ring<00:01:20.740> ever<00:01:20.950> since<00:01:21.190> it's<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.770> just<00:01:23.890> one

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
stage ring ever since it's it's just one

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.070 
stage ring ever since it's it's just one
of<00:01:24.250> those<00:01:24.340> heads<00:01:24.640> were<00:01:24.910> all<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.780> stars

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
of those heads were all the stars

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.170 
of those heads were all the stars
aligned<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.860> all<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.130> transistors<00:01:27.820> worked

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
aligned and all the transistors worked

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.510 
aligned and all the transistors worked
and<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.510> capacitors<00:01:29.110> worked<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:30.280> just

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
and the capacitors worked and it's just

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.910 
and the capacitors worked and it's just
like<00:01:30.760> it's<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.570> golden<00:01:32.020> child<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.619> speak

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
so I sent that to the Marshall Factory

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.710 
so I sent that to the Marshall Factory

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
and said why is this head so cool and

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.900 
and said why is this head so cool and
that's<00:01:38.440> what<00:01:38.920> came<00:01:39.100> back<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.520> know<00:01:39.550> it's<00:01:39.759> all

and<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:49.149> said<00:01:49.360> how<00:01:49.509> can<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.340> where<00:01:51.550> I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
and I said how can we make it to where I

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.880 
and I said how can we make it to where I
can<00:01:51.910> take<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.360> guitar<00:01:52.539> cord<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.500> plug<00:01:53.710> into

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
can take a guitar cord and plug into

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.010 
can take a guitar cord and plug into
this<00:01:54.100> head<00:01:54.310> as<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:55.030> see<00:01:55.270> that's<00:01:55.780> all

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
this head as you can see that's all

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.680 
this head as you can see that's all
there<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.200> here<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:58.060> plugging<00:01:58.300> straight<00:01:58.570> in

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
the head this is sound you get I can

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.160 
the head this is sound you get I can
play<00:02:00.190> any<00:02:00.430> place<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:00.970> planet<00:02:01.149> get<00:02:01.990> this

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.240 
play any place on the planet get this
head<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.920> can<00:02:03.070> do<00:02:03.160> a<00:02:03.190> show<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.720> think<00:02:05.250> talking

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
head and I can do a show I think talking

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.249 
head and I can do a show I think talking
about<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> beast<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:07.209> know<00:02:07.569> like<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.050> said<00:02:08.110> I

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
about the beast you know like I said I

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.410 
about the beast you know like I said I
still<00:02:08.530> have<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.800> think<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:10.060> only<00:02:10.209> way<00:02:10.360> to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
still have I think the only way to

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.500 
still have I think the only way to
describe<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.970> Satan<00:02:12.970> reached<00:02:13.270> up

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
describe it is like Satan reached up

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.140 
describe it is like Satan reached up
from<00:02:13.750> Hell<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.260> touch<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.860> head<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.370> talked

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
from Hell and touch that head and talked

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.550 
from Hell and touch that head and talked
to<00:02:16.270> Jim<00:02:16.450> Marshall<00:02:16.690> about<00:02:16.990> making<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> perfect

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
to Jim Marshall about making the perfect

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.940 
to Jim Marshall about making the perfect
800<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:20.020> was<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.200> result<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.800> it's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
800 and that was a result and it's

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.520 
800 and that was a result and it's
that's<00:02:21.730> cool<00:02:21.940> man<00:02:22.209> but<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.020> spawn<00:02:23.319> of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
that's cool man but this is the spawn of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.160 
that's cool man but this is the spawn of
the<00:02:23.620> beast<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.670> one's<00:02:25.170> essentially

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the beast so this one's essentially

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.730 
the beast so this one's essentially
cooler<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.400> with<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:28.390> head<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:29.230> essentially

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
cooler so with this head you essentially

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.220 
cooler so with this head you essentially
got<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.130> EQ<00:02:30.670> parameter<00:02:31.510> built<00:02:31.780> into<00:02:32.080> one

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
got that EQ parameter built into one

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.780 
got that EQ parameter built into one
knob<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:33.670> take<00:02:34.300> my<00:02:34.630> sound<00:02:35.050> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
knob so you can just take my sound and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.400 
knob so you can just take my sound and
add<00:02:36.790> more<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.599> or<00:02:37.720> less<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.260> can

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
add more of it or less of it you can

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.500 
add more of it or less of it you can
adjust<00:02:38.650> every<00:02:39.220> parameter<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> 10<00:02:40.270> band

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
adjust every parameter in the 10 band

800 was the head I wanted to use I was
running<00:03:44.930> 65<00:03:45.590> 50s<00:03:46.870> because<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.020> me<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.230> was<00:03:48.320> a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
running 65 50s because for me it was a

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.870 
running 65 50s because for me it was a
warmer<00:03:48.740> sounding<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:50.020> el34s<00:03:51.020> wasn't<00:03:51.470> my<00:03:51.560> thing

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
because you know I think it made a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.750 
because you know I think it made a
difference<00:03:54.500> in<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.680> sound<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.430> know
