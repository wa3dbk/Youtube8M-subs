00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.719
 at the dark shaman with the new 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 patch 5.4 first a very same 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.509
 important note and that is likely with 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.039
 Do not fight this in the room inside 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 but he pulls her out the same way 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.289
 the open space of simply the place 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 will need and accordingly good 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.220
 to dodge 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.619
 you fight against 2.10 shaman which 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.279
 sitting on two warships and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.690
 First you kill the war wolves 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.340
 and meanwhile, she grabs 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.020
 the shamans tank the twelve 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.490
 go achieved very quickly about 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.830
 So you can maybe think about it 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.360
 hours of fighting right at the beginning 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.470
 to do it more quickly and as possible 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.330
 Do not die or thirst before them 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.670
 wolves are that such a club after 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.430
 make her front has about 600,000 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.200
 harm the market and could be offered as soon as possible 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.150
 the wolves are down everyone has 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.160
 tank up shamans and you should then 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.890
 try these a little further apart 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.590
 to refuel and only for a short time if times 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.870
 just no skills announced 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.830
 these will contract in the mixed 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.700
 to be able to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.960
 but otherwise this is important now 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 to refuel just because the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 skills like the thunderstorm or too 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.340
 this green father could ground 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.030
 the same will see or the apps 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.390
 appear 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.440
 the end of the game is played by players and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.330
 that can be done by the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.010
 we are pulling the entire room here 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.380
 would cyclone storm there you have of course 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.080
 dodge and also what you something here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 worse 7 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.490
 this crackling cloud would be in the now 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.860
 near the shaman is located out of it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.300
 then arises the cyclone but the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.010
 makes a lot of damage 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.060
 So you should definitely go out there 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.250
 Run to fast auckland and nobody 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.650
 He is the new interface in the view field 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.720
 because he already gets hurt 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.780
 now just seen of that 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.270
 we really in front of the swirl actually 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.310
 So if it just hurt 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.300
 then get away and company 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 the ability would be exported at 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.440
 first two a bit surprised though 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.569
 the doctors only have 400,000 live the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.580
 can then quite well practically built 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.709
 therefore 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.660
 they are also very slow so soon 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.610
 The exports make everyone a feast 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.850
 idea what's needed then runs 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.560
 just go away and they can 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.290
 practically not an important stop 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.450
 once you had while running on that you 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.319
 do not you not from a summit meeting 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.150
 lets and thus practically not 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.590
 Constant damage will just keep it that way 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.780
 my damage gets right away 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.880
 walk a few meters further until he 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 have no more that everyone has two 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.780
 Bossen succeeds in having it over 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.090
 400 million I believe you do 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.709
 another 15 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.330
 that is when he just does not care 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.340
 bee looks or multi-power there 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.410
 not both of these then down to 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.569
 bring as soon as you reach 30 percent 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.200
 are you still fighting yourself? 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.310
 bausch and of course increase theirs 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.310
 hurt again considerably 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.829
 very nicely sting pentagon shaman that 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.840
 fire red he measures that skills 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.730
 the swirls 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.950
 This is what the apps will be about forever 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.439
 I asked the shamans about the totems 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.900
 pose triggered and therefore could then 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.120
 see how far he is right at the beginning 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.599
 practically run away you have this 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.950
 elementary because those form straight line 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.569
 Of course, this does not mean everyone is running 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.099
 said doing harm and out of the fire 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.599
 was probably now the comet 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.920
 of course it would have to be there 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:49.139
 rauslaufen 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:52.290
 because otherwise we are here very much 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.329
 look beautiful can you right's even 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.319
 times the fire threatened right back 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.310
 a comet that invades and the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.760
 elementary but stay from the first 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.829
 Termin are thus blocked then you 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.680
 the longer the fight takes more and more 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.560
 the roads and therefore it is likely 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.269
 makes sense to be on a corner too 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.569
 some where handy at the post office 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.250
 be lowered and be consistent with it 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.510
 to move the world in one direction 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.630
 just to have enough space does 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.340
 to be able to select the whole effects 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.810
 what is her still a significant disadvantage 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.979
 is not that much you are so much 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.000
 thought is the elevations that 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.039
 can be practical after the ge be in 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.470
 terms of range or any ao 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.389
 effects or at majors wink or 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.449
 so that's not what you want 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.190
 effect her husband should be 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.169
 I'll say a very big one 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.150
 Sophisticated fits so if you are 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.550
 well placed and especially the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.440
 ability to keep in mind this should 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.880
 so far no problem 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.530
 the longer the fight lasts all the more 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.409
 Of course it will be more difficult here 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.389
 are already could pull relatively well 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.620
 a short time now a lot of the 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.970
 Bank put many toxic fields what 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.350
 Of course, a relatively high 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.570
 damage 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.280
 if people do not have to go out there with them 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.410
 so bring themselves out as more and would 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.210
 as fast as possible and then you should 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.650
 you have no problem with the boards 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.420
 should give it ask questions this 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.950
 easy in the comments and otherwise 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.300
 look through the other videos with it 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.200
 the best on the new instance 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.200
 be prepared
