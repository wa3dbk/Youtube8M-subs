00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.220 

so<00:00:11.700> even<00:00:12.000> though<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.509> dimensions<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
so even though I have the dimensions and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.429 
so even though I have the dimensions and
I<00:00:13.320> could<00:00:13.500> pre-cut<00:00:13.920> everything<00:00:15.320> when<00:00:16.320> I'm

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
I could pre-cut everything when I'm

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:17.839 
I could pre-cut everything when I'm
cutting<00:00:16.800> things<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> field<00:00:17.550> obviously

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
cutting things in the field obviously

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.980 
cutting things in the field obviously
I'm<00:00:18.330> depending<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.980> ability<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.490> measure

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
I'm depending on my ability to measure

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
I'm depending on my ability to measure
so<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> put<00:00:22.950> something<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
so when I put something like this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.690 
so when I put something like this
together<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.439> take<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> few<00:00:25.800> extra<00:00:26.130> steps<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.579> do

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
together I take a few extra steps and do

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.179 
together I take a few extra steps and do
a<00:00:26.730> little<00:00:26.970> pre<00:00:27.210> assembly<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.949> get

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
a little pre assembly so that I get

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.229 
a little pre assembly so that I get
things<00:00:29.460> lined<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.000> right<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
things lined up just right so I have the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.299 
things lined up just right so I have the
main<00:00:33.239> part<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> top<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
main part of the top on and I need to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.439 
main part of the top on and I need to
cut<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.580> a<00:00:35.760> section<00:00:36.410> where<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.610> miter<00:00:38.610> saw<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
cut out a section where the miter saw is

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.170 
cut out a section where the miter saw is
going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.830> a<00:00:40.890> clamped<00:00:41.489> right

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
going to go so I have a clamped right

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.260 
going to go so I have a clamped right
how<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.449> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.720> attached<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:44.270> I've

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
how it's going to be attached and I've

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
how it's going to be attached and I've
checked<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.930> dimension<00:00:46.800> between<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.370> which

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
checked my dimension between here which

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
checked my dimension between here which
is<00:00:47.760> accurate<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.840> I've<00:00:49.020> checked<00:00:49.559> for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
is accurate and then I've checked for

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670 
is accurate and then I've checked for
square<00:00:50.149> because<00:00:51.149> these<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:52.050> thin<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
square because these are thin and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.959 
square because these are thin and
they're<00:00:53.670> easily<00:00:53.870> easy<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.140> bend<00:00:55.350> around<00:00:55.969> so

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
they're easily easy to bend around so

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.860 
they're easily easy to bend around so
I've<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.359> them<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:58.710> square<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
I've got them so they're square and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
I've got them so they're square and
parallel<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> outside<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.760> got

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
parallel to the outside and I've got

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
parallel to the outside and I've got
marks<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.899> once<00:01:04.259> I<00:01:04.410> had<00:01:04.589> these<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> had

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
marks so then once I had these I had

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.889 
marks so then once I had these I had
them<00:01:05.399> clamped<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.060> once<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> had<00:01:06.450> them<00:01:06.539> clamped

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
them clamped and once I had them clamped

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.930 
them clamped and once I had them clamped
right<00:01:07.050> where<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> wanted<00:01:07.560> them<00:01:07.649> I<00:01:07.890> scribed<00:01:08.759> the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
right where I wanted them I scribed the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.400 
right where I wanted them I scribed the
line<00:01:09.149> underneath<00:01:09.509> because<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.259> to<00:01:10.320> be

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
line underneath because I'm going to be

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.620 
line underneath because I'm going to be
cutting<00:01:10.679> part<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:12.539> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
cutting part of this out and I want to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
cutting part of this out and I want to
flush<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.800> this<00:01:14.039> inside<00:01:14.429> spreader<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
flush with this inside spreader but I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
flush with this inside spreader but I
know<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> assemble<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
know then when I go to assemble this I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.320 
know then when I go to assemble this I
can<00:01:18.740> put<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> glue<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.100> square<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.030> start

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
can put the glue on square it up start

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.670 
can put the glue on square it up start
putting<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> screws<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.470> could

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
putting in the screws and then I could

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.120 
putting in the screws and then I could
pull<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.600> right<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.930> where<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> cut<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
pull these right to where the cut is and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.499 
pull these right to where the cut is and
know<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.490> everything<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> layout

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
know that everything is going to layout

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
know that everything is going to layout
the<00:01:27.990> T<00:01:28.320> track<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:28.950> building<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.880> go

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the T track that I'm building will go

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.140 
the T track that I'm building will go
all<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.500> both<00:01:31.770> sides<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.970> by

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
all the way to here on both sides but by

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
all the way to here on both sides but by
putting<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.079> straight<00:01:34.380> line<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
putting this in one straight line and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.520 
putting this in one straight line and
getting<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.250> lined<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.990> know<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
getting it all lined up I know that this

all the dimensions on it at that by the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.920 
all the dimensions on it at that by the
time<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.149> done<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.689> I'll<00:01:57.899> be

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
time I'm done with this I'll be

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
time I'm done with this I'll be
recording<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.009> these<00:01:59.189> dimensions<00:01:59.700> verifying

recording all these dimensions verifying

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
recording all these dimensions verifying
them<00:02:00.479> getting<00:02:00.869> them<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> plans<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.310> again

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
them getting them on the plans but again

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.280 
them getting them on the plans but again
when<00:02:03.210> you're<00:02:03.329> doing<00:02:03.570> something<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:03.960> this

when you're doing something like this
unless<00:02:04.619> you're<00:02:04.770> cutting<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.460> CNC

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
unless you're cutting it with a CNC

unless you're cutting it with a CNC
machine<00:02:06.560> you're<00:02:07.560> still<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:09.959> there's

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
machine you're still you know there's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
machine you're still you know there's
still<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> possibility<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.519> some<00:02:11.700> human<00:02:12.000> error

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
still a possibility of some human error

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
still a possibility of some human error
but<00:02:12.720> anyway<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.049> I<00:02:13.170> know<00:02:13.290> I've<00:02:13.500> got<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.709> all

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
but anyway so I know I've got it all

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.460 
but anyway so I know I've got it all
right<00:02:14.130> now<00:02:14.160> I've<00:02:14.519> got<00:02:14.700> my<00:02:14.730> marks<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> can

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
right now I've got my marks so now I can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.009 
right now I've got my marks so now I can
unclamp<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.130> make<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.820> cut<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.239> then<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.870> can

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
unclamp it make the cut and then I can

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.259 
unclamp it make the cut and then I can
put<00:02:19.169> it<00:02:19.260> back<00:02:19.380> together<00:02:19.590> glue<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.820> screw<00:02:21.120> this

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
put it back together glue and screw this

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.390 
put it back together glue and screw this
this<00:02:21.840> section<00:02:22.290> down<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.919> then

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
this section down and then

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:34.920 
this section down and then
continue<00:02:23.849> on<00:02:24.000> building<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.750> rest<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.079> it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:51.100 

you

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
