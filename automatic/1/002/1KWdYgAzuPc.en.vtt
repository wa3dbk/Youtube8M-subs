Kerry's eyes even more do the smoky eye
the<00:03:24.450> idea<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.040> color<00:03:26.280> goes<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
the idea is that the color goes the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.010 
the idea is that the color goes the
whole<00:03:26.850> way<00:03:27.090> around<00:03:27.210> the<00:03:27.510> eye<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.390> just

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
whole way around the eye so this just

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.790 
whole way around the eye so this just
smudges<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:33.120> liner<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:34.380> will<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.650> make

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
smudges in the liner it will just make

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
smudges in the liner it will just make
it<00:03:34.950> look<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.130> bit<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.870> sexy<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.640> how

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
it look a bit more sexy and that is how

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.050 
it look a bit more sexy and that is how
you<00:03:38.880> do<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.330> smoky

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060
