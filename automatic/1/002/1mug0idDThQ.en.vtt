00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
game and then you get them it has to be

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.729 
game and then you get them it has to be
all<00:00:44.120> in<00:00:44.329> one<00:00:44.359> game<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:44.899> I'm<00:00:44.960> playing<00:00:45.230> one<00:00:45.440> shot

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
all in one game so I'm playing one shot

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.590 
all in one game so I'm playing one shot
here<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:46.100> as<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.309> can<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.460> I<00:00:46.820> end<00:00:47.239> up<00:00:47.300> getting

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
here and as you can see I end up getting

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.240 
here and as you can see I end up getting
for<00:00:47.809> death<00:00:48.109> from<00:00:48.289> above<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:48.829> means<00:00:49.129> I

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
for death from above so that means I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.490 
for death from above so that means I
have<00:00:49.280> unlocked<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.789> jackboots<00:00:50.510> for<00:00:51.170> three

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.439 
have unlocked the jackboots for three
death<00:00:51.739> from<00:00:51.890> above<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.820> jack<00:00:53.090> shin

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
death from above and the jack shin

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.750

guards<00:00:53.840> for<00:00:54.109> for<00:00:54.379> death<00:00:54.679> from<00:00:54.859> above<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:55.550> this

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
guards for for death from above so this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.060 
guards for for death from above so this
the<00:00:55.969> easiest<00:00:56.269> game<00:00:56.480> honestly<00:00:56.840> is<00:00:57.320> one<00:00:57.769> shot

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
the easiest game honestly is one shot

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.279 
the easiest game honestly is one shot
because<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.699> health<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.300> reduced<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.870> it's

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
because the health is reduced and it's
