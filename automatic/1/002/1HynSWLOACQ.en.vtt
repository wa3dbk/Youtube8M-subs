want to do with a shorter club is we're
going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> vary<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> width<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.320> our<00:00:16.470> stance<00:00:18.140> so

going to vary the width of our stance so

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.769 
going to vary the width of our stance so
my<00:00:19.410> ideal<00:00:19.920> position<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.850> ball<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.510> not

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
each Club that I have in my bag so for a
wedge<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> big<00:00:51.059> long<00:00:51.449> swing

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
wedge because it's not a big long swing

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.590 
wedge because it's not a big long swing
I<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.280> big<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.910> foot<00:00:54.239> width

I don't need as big a right foot width

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
I don't need as big a right foot width
that's<00:00:55.350> enough<00:00:55.620> balance<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> swing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that's enough balance for me to swing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.779 
that's enough balance for me to swing
this<00:00:56.879> club<00:00:57.210> comfortably<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.399> as<00:00:59.399> we'll<00:00:59.579> see

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this club comfortably and as we'll see

that<00:01:00.120> ball<00:01:00.390> almost<00:01:00.809> looks<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> middle<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that ball almost looks in the middle of

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
that ball almost looks in the middle of
my<00:01:01.920> stance<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.359> foot<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
my stance because my right foot is not

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.640 
my stance because my right foot is not
very<00:01:04.320> wide<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.830> relation<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.850> my<00:01:06.060> shoulders

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
very wide in relation to my shoulders

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
very wide in relation to my shoulders
now<00:01:07.650> let's<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> 6-iron<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
now let's go to a 6-iron I'm going to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
now let's go to a 6-iron I'm going to
keep<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.049> left<00:01:10.380> foot<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.799> ball<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
keep my left foot and the ball in the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
keep my left foot and the ball in the
same<00:01:11.549> relative<00:01:11.820> position<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.869> i'm<00:01:12.960> just

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
same relative position and i'm just

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.719 
same relative position and i'm just
going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> widen<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.100> foot<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
going to widen my right foot out for a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.520 
going to widen my right foot out for a
bit<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.000> balance<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> longer

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
bit more balance because it's a longer

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
bit more balance because it's a longer
Club<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:17.970> we'll<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.360> how<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> ball

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
Club and now we'll see how the ball

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
Club and now we'll see how the ball
position<00:01:19.020> has<00:01:19.470> shifted<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.400> bit

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
position has shifted a little bit

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.120 
position has shifted a little bit
forward<00:01:21.290> visually<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.799> actual<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
forward visually but not actual we go to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.370 
forward visually but not actual we go to
a<00:01:26.220> longer<00:01:26.549> Club<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:27.060> our<00:01:27.180> woods<00:01:27.420> keep<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
a longer Club into our woods keep the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
a longer Club into our woods keep the
ball<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:28.950> left<00:01:29.159> foot<00:01:29.369> exactly<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> same<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
ball and my left foot exactly the same a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.230 
ball and my left foot exactly the same a
little<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.320> wider<00:01:31.530> stance<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.030> longer

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
little bit wider stance that's a longer

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
little bit wider stance that's a longer
Club<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> need<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.140> balanced<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.829> swing

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
Club and I need more balanced as I swing

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
Club and I need more balanced as I swing
and<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> ball<00:01:36.869> looks

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and now we can see the ball looks

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.399 
and now we can see the ball looks
shifted<00:01:37.560> forward<00:01:38.720> what<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
shifted forward what we want to do is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.440 
shifted forward what we want to do is
find<00:01:40.770> where<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.130> hit<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> ground<00:01:41.670> after<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
find where we hit the ground after the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.260 
find where we hit the ground after the
ball<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.799> ball<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.549> spot<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
ball put that ball in that spot in
