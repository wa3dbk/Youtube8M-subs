00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
was hilarious yeah would you just put an

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.429 
was hilarious yeah would you just put an
input<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:55.420> once<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.780> stops<00:01:56.140> flashing

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
input and then once it stops flashing

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.089 
input and then once it stops flashing
them<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.039> no<00:01:57.220> did<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:57.640> know<00:01:57.759> it's<00:01:57.939> ready<00:01:58.149> and

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
them and no did you know it's ready and

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.910 
them and no did you know it's ready and
then<00:02:00.099> direction<00:02:00.580> does<00:02:00.729> matter<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.619> kind<00:02:02.860> of

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
then direction does matter the kind of

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.410 
then direction does matter the kind of
automatically<00:02:03.310> does<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:03.909> or<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:04.330> it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
automatically does it for you or if it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.359 
automatically does it for you or if it
takes<00:02:04.599> you<00:02:04.750> long<00:02:04.929> like<00:02:05.830> if<00:02:06.009> they're<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.340> right

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
takes you long like if they're the right

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.219 
takes you long like if they're the right
plate<00:02:06.789> positioning<00:02:07.479> like<00:02:07.599> I<00:02:07.750> did<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.019> down

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
plate positioning like I did it down

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.589 
plate positioning like I did it down
strong<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.729> therefore<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.149> will<00:02:10.239> happen<00:02:10.360> like

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
strong so therefore it will happen like

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.949 
strong so therefore it will happen like
that<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.610> then<00:02:16.030> other<00:02:16.299> things<00:02:16.390> depend<00:02:16.870> on

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
that and then other things depend on

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.800 
that and then other things depend on

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
melee like manually actually I think I

00:04:48.770 --> 00:05:05.690 
melee like manually actually I think I
can<00:04:48.919> force<00:04:49.160> them<00:04:49.400> somehow<00:04:49.850> by<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.360> that

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.290 

oh<00:05:05.760> yeah<00:05:06.360> if<00:05:06.900> he<00:05:07.020> comes<00:05:07.170> out<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.500> her<00:05:07.620> dad<00:05:08.300> which

actually<00:05:09.480> just<00:05:09.750> which<00:05:10.080> also<00:05:10.320> isn't<00:05:10.560> volatile

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
actually just which also isn't volatile

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.940 
actually just which also isn't volatile
melee<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.550> think<00:05:12.200> but<00:05:13.200> she'll<00:05:13.440> do<00:05:13.560> an<00:05:13.680> attack

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950

straight<00:05:14.250> out<00:05:14.720> I'm<00:05:15.720> not<00:05:15.870> sure<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.230> think

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.980 
straight out I'm not sure I think
there's<00:05:16.650> some<00:05:17.030> frames<00:05:18.030> where<00:05:18.690> she's<00:05:18.840> not

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990

there's some frames where she's not
attacking<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.440> lot<00:05:19.590> make<00:05:19.740> sure<00:05:20.810> actually<00:05:21.810> I

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840
