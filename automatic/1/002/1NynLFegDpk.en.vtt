00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.730
 Look at the cat here 's the following prosecutor. 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.770
 on here 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.830
 each portion 2 to very good car 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.199
 again who likes car 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.210
 collector 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.710
 here we see most of his plays 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.529
 in deplorable condition 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.810
 It has been years since anyone has played here. 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.630
 here you have an idea for the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.880
 wear in the car here. 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.280
 gasoline, how old do you think it is? 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.390
 the lawyer that piece is not white 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.460
 told lytha 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.989
 and here you also stretch out 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.699
 from here is to use the same float you have 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 an idea seems to have dust but not 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.010
 is dust is a corrosion that goes together 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.359
 the very alcohol that it has in the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.399
 gasoline 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:59.739
 the wholesale side of good dirty house more 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.929
 well dirty even a little points 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.720
 corrosion 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:08.560
 the cover of your dirty step does not have much 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.860
 novelty not a little bit of dirt 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.930
 now the most serious of all this is the basis 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.130
 and his beyond the west is burst with 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.490
 It 's slack here and there we see 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.120
 the following is original 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.130
 the car is 78 this base here has goes 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.090
 turn 40 years right 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.940
 and now in 2018 it is not 36 36 years of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.980
 I use the same part and here some 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.500
 some mechanic tried to take these 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.210
 bolts without locking and here the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.510
 People only see a screw 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.070
 so here's broke this piece that is 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.470
 working loose guy only has one 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.300
 bolt holding the axle a situation 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.110
 that this car owner would tighten the 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.950
 accelerator and look there and count how 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.930
 suddenly this butterfly that for some 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.270
 motif breaks another screw head 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.190
 She goes down, the car stays behind. 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.510
 way here giving more or less of 5 to 6 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.430
 thousand engine turns 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.220
 running the risk of even exploiting the engine 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.230
 cause an accident in the minimum 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.840
 accelerating could damage the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.550
 engine in an emergency situation 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.820
 could stop the accelerator 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.130
 position and a strike could happen 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.920
 an accident something more serious 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.780
