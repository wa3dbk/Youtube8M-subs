00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
of bicycles this one is a old columbia

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
of bicycles this one is a old columbia
but<00:00:51.629> someone<00:00:51.870> who<00:00:51.930> could<00:00:52.019> probably<00:00:52.199> rose

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
but someone who could probably rose

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.020 
but someone who could probably rose
restore<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:54.269> it<00:00:55.550> worse<00:00:56.550> than<00:00:56.850> well

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
restore and make it worse than well

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.780 
restore and make it worse than well
there's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> little<00:00:57.769> shed<00:00:58.769> down<00:00:59.040> there<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:02.550> does

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
there's a little shed down there it does

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.420 
there's a little shed down there it does
look<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.000> most<00:01:03.360> of<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.629> stuff<00:01:03.900> is<00:01:04.339> kind<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
look like most of the stuff is kind of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.930 
look like most of the stuff is kind of
caving<00:01:05.730> in<00:01:06.230> down<00:01:07.230> here<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
caving in down here I can see up to the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.640 
caving in down here I can see up to the
ceiling<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.610> or<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.820> through<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.270> ceiling

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
ceiling so the or up through the ceiling

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.210 
ceiling so the or up through the ceiling
up<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:14.370> so<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:14.940> think<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.479> it's

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
up here so I don't think that it's

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.660 
up here so I don't think that it's
probably<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> safe<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:19.190> upper<00:01:20.190> areas

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
probably that safe up in the upper areas

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.200 
probably that safe up in the upper areas
either<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.579> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> walk<00:01:23.880> around<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
either so I'm going to walk around the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.870 
either so I'm going to walk around the
other<00:01:24.270> side<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:25.369> another<00:01:26.369> shot<00:01:26.579> there<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
other side here another shot there the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
other side here another shot there the
thing<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.360> says<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.719> use<00:01:28.079> toxic

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
thing here it says do not use toxic

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
thing here it says do not use toxic
chemicals<00:01:29.299> another<00:01:30.299> reason<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> enter<00:01:31.229> in

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
chemicals another reason not to enter in

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.450 
chemicals another reason not to enter in
here<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.939> old<00:01:33.119> bikes<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.689> lot<00:01:33.719> more<00:01:34.460> stuff

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
here but more old bikes a lot more stuff

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.850 
here but more old bikes a lot more stuff
like<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.090> must<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.390> recently<00:01:38.149> kind<00:01:39.149> of

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
like that so must be recently kind of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.760 
like that so must be recently kind of
abandoned<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.979> guess<00:01:41.159> shadows<00:01:42.619> ceiling<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
abandoned I guess shadows ceiling and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
abandoned I guess shadows ceiling and
stuff<00:01:44.009> too<00:01:44.360> here's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> look<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.079> if
