you're<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.840> you're<00:01:52.020> creating<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> very

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you're you know you're creating a very

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.499 
you're you know you're creating a very
solid<00:01:53.070> wall<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.970> cheating<00:01:54.329> because

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
solid wall and you're cheating because

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.789 
solid wall and you're cheating because
you're<00:01:54.750> using<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.140> edge<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> map<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.219> your

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
you're using the edge of the map as your

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.920 
you're using the edge of the map as your
as<00:01:58.799> liking<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> lot<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.700> dividing<00:02:00.360> line<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
as liking a lot of dividing line or as a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.260 
as liking a lot of dividing line or as a
border<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.100> wish<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> wouldn't<00:02:02.880> happen<00:02:03.000> real

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
border I wish it wouldn't happen real

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
border I wish it wouldn't happen real
life<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.899> know<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.860> of

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
life but you know what I don't know of

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
life but you know what I don't know of
any<00:02:05.130> general<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.700> would<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.259> just

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
any general that would you know just

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.900 
any general that would you know just
straight<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.500> fight<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> expect<00:02:08.879> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
straight out fight you know I expect to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.059 
straight out fight you know I expect to
win<00:02:09.090> especially<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.629> against<00:02:09.989> Neil<00:02:10.229> these

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
win especially with against Neil these

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.010 
win especially with against Neil these
aren't<00:02:11.220> even<00:02:11.400> odds

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
aren't even odds

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.960 
aren't even odds
so<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.830> enemy<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.130> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.430> know<00:02:13.520> enemy

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so the enemy is going to you know enemy

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.550 
so the enemy is going to you know enemy
is<00:02:14.030> constantly<00:02:14.420> moving<00:02:14.570> towards<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.020> because

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
is constantly moving towards you because

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.070 
is constantly moving towards you because
you<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.160> moved<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.090> ran<00:02:17.450> quickly<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you have moved and you ran quickly and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.170 
you have moved and you ran quickly and
you<00:02:18.140> set<00:02:18.350> up<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.560> position<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.610> guys<00:02:20.000> are

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you set up this position your guys are

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.340 
you set up this position your guys are
going<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.360> be<00:02:20.420> arrested<00:02:20.600> by<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.960> time<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
going to be arrested by the time that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.080 
going to be arrested by the time that
the<00:02:21.440> enemy<00:02:21.560> reaches<00:02:22.100> them<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.640> that's<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.970> key

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the enemy reaches them so that's the key

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.670 
the enemy reaches them so that's the key
point<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.570> forming<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.110> know<00:02:24.230> basically

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
point of forming you know basically

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.590 
point of forming you know basically
forming<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.940> corner<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.360> other<00:02:26.510> reason

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
forming in this corner the other reason

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.270 
forming in this corner the other reason
why<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.840> form<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.260> far<00:02:27.530> corner<00:02:27.890> is

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
why you form in this far corner is

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.980 
why you form in this far corner is
because<00:02:28.610> since<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.000> enemy<00:02:29.270> there's<00:02:29.660> enemy

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
because since the enemy there's enemy

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.990 
because since the enemy there's enemy
here<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.830> would<00:02:30.950> take<00:02:31.070> lessons<00:02:31.460> from<00:02:31.670> them

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
here it would take lessons from them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.790 
here it would take lessons from them
travel<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.990> takes<00:02:33.170> longer<00:02:33.530> distance

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
travel here that takes longer distance

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.960 
travel here that takes longer distance
for<00:02:33.950> them<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.130> travel<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.490> by<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.700> time<00:02:34.820> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
for them to travel there by the time to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.240 
for them to travel there by the time to
get<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.270> they're<00:02:35.600> gonna<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.810> tired<00:02:36.250> and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
get to you they're gonna be tired and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.280 
get to you they're gonna be tired and
also<00:02:37.460> by<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.670> point<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.330> know<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.690> they're

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
also by that point you know the they're

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.020 
also by that point you know the they're
more<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.010> morale<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.400> going<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.580> be<00:02:40.670> beating

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
more the morale is going to be beating

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.420 
more the morale is going to be beating
you<00:02:41.180> know<00:02:41.240> your<00:02:42.140> sole<00:02:42.560> purpose<00:02:42.920> right<00:02:43.100> now<00:02:43.220> is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
should be able to take it out the other

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.380 
should be able to take it out the other
thing<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.520> know<00:03:07.580> as<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.180> see

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
thing is that you know as you can see

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.150 
thing is that you know as you can see
here<00:03:08.690> your<00:03:08.930> cavalry<00:03:09.440> are<00:03:09.620> off<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.950> side

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
here your cavalry are off to the side

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.980 
here your cavalry are off to the side
they're<00:03:10.370> not<00:03:10.520> behind<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.000> line<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.450> the

they're not behind the line and the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.850 
they're not behind the line and the
reason<00:03:12.170> why<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.440> they're<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:12.800> to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
reason why is because they're going to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.880 
reason why is because they're going to
be<00:03:12.920> busy<00:03:13.070> as<00:03:13.570> this<00:03:14.570> line<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.140> infantry<00:03:15.350> and
