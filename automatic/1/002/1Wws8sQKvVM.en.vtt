00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.360 
which resembled their colorway one
feature<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.569> has<00:02:22.200> drawn<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> lot<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.980> people

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
feature that has drawn a lot of people

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.610 
feature that has drawn a lot of people
to<00:02:23.580> them<00:02:23.760> including<00:02:24.300> myself<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> fact

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
to them including myself it's the fact

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
to them including myself it's the fact
that<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:25.920> kept<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> true<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> og<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that they kept it true to the og and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.020 
that they kept it true to the og and
they<00:02:28.080> decided<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> leave<00:02:29.040> off<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.640> jump<00:02:29.880> man

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
they decided to leave off the jump man

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.330 
they decided to leave off the jump man
on<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.420> back

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
on the back

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.610 
on the back
and<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:32.030> think<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.599> helps<00:02:32.810> makes<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.349> shoe<00:02:33.590> a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
and I think it helps makes the shoe a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.800 
and I think it helps makes the shoe a
little<00:02:33.950> more<00:02:34.130> clean<00:02:34.459> cleared<00:02:34.880> up<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.270> it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
little more clean cleared up and it

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.479 
little more clean cleared up and it
definitely<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> nice<00:02:36.530> touch<00:02:36.800> knowing<00:02:37.370> that

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
definitely is a nice touch knowing that

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.100 
definitely is a nice touch knowing that
it's<00:02:37.640> exactly<00:02:38.239> how<00:02:38.450> they<00:02:38.569> used<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.870> look<00:02:39.050> like

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
it's exactly how they used to look like

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.260 
it's exactly how they used to look like
there's<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.920> different<00:02:40.310> type<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.520> texture<00:02:41.030> on

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
there's a different type of texture on

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.180 
there's a different type of texture on
this<00:02:41.480> compared<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.020> any<00:02:42.170> other<00:02:42.349> one<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.040> like

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
this compared to any other one it's like

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.750 
this compared to any other one it's like
a<00:02:43.220> suede<00:02:44.180> belt<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.890> kind<00:02:46.069> of<00:02:46.160> hard<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.489> even

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.339 
a suede belt it's kind of hard to even
describe<00:02:47.120> how<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:47.870> it's<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.019> really

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
describe how it is but it's a really

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.500 
describe how it is but it's a really
nice<00:02:48.500> touch<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.400> wasn't<00:02:49.819> expecting<00:02:50.480> that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
nice touch to it I wasn't expecting that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.540
