00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and calm and even happiness in a time of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.870 
and calm and even happiness in a time of
crisis<00:01:17.840> at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> beginning<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> book<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
crisis at the beginning of the book I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.249 
crisis at the beginning of the book I
challenged<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> reader<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> take<00:01:21.960> sides

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
challenged the reader not to take sides

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
challenged the reader not to take sides
because<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.100> wasn't<00:01:23.549> taking<00:01:23.850> sides<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
because I wasn't taking sides and I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.380 
because I wasn't taking sides and I
think<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.380> important<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:26.820> going

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
think it's so important when we're going

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
think it's so important when we're going
with<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> situation<00:01:28.080> instead<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.979> being

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
with a situation instead of being

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.359 
with a situation instead of being
reactionary<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.750> consider<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.829> power<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
reactionary to consider the power in the
