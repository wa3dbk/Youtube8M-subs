balance<00:00:20.310> right<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:23.939> by

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
balance right here we can start by

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
balance right here we can start by
actually<00:00:24.390> holding<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> hitch<00:00:25.500> into

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
actually holding up the hitch into

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
actually holding up the hitch into
position<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> good<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> have

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
position this is a good one to have

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
position this is a good one to have
enough<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> set<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.410> hands<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.830> your<00:00:29.310> goes<00:00:29.460> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
enough to set of hands for your goes on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.130 
enough to set of hands for your goes on
the<00:00:29.699> inside<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> frame<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.810> there's<00:00:30.960> two

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the inside of a frame and there's two

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
the inside of a frame and there's two
notches<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.160> keep<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> little<00:00:32.610> bit

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
notches on there to keep it a little bit

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.979 
notches on there to keep it a little bit
higher<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> little<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.360> lower<00:00:33.450> depending<00:00:33.809> on

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
higher a little bit lower depending on

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.830 
higher a little bit lower depending on
clearance<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.860> your<00:00:35.070> bumper<00:00:35.430> fascia<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:41.840> good

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
clearance with your bumper fascia a good

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
clearance with your bumper fascia a good
idea<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.170> install<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.789> hitch<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:45.000> close<00:00:45.180> as

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
idea to install your hitch as close as

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.670 
idea to install your hitch as close as
possible<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.489> install<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:47.520> hardware

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.139 

in<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.949> case<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> hitch<00:00:53.699> installed

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
in this case we have the hitch installed

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
in this case we have the hitch installed
at<00:00:54.329> its<00:00:54.449> lowest<00:00:54.600> position<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
at its lowest position right now so it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
at its lowest position right now so it
gives<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.190> idea<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:56.940> kind<00:00:57.090> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
gives you an idea of what kind of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
gives you an idea of what kind of
clearance<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.629> run<00:00:57.840> into<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> get

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
clearance you can run into I want to get

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
clearance you can run into I want to get
your<00:00:59.520> bolts<00:00:59.760> installed<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.270> go<00:01:00.359> ahead<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
your bolts installed we can go ahead and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.100 
your bolts installed we can go ahead and
stall<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> hardware<00:01:04.489> okay<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.869> still<00:01:07.049> won't

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
stall the hardware okay you still won't

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.330 
stall the hardware okay you still won't
leave<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> list<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> move<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> hitch

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
leave a list if I have to move the hitch

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.950 
leave a list if I have to move the hitch
back<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> forth<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> rest<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> our

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
hardware again we'll install our

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
hardware again we'll install our
hardware<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> outside<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.120 
hardware from the outside in to the
square<00:01:14.070> hole<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.799> plate

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
square hole and then also this plate

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.789 
square hole and then also this plate
goes<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.580> between<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.509> hitch<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> bolt

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.429 

okay<00:01:28.569> then<00:01:29.569> go<00:01:29.689> ahead<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:29.960> put<00:01:30.079> our<00:01:30.109> rest<00:01:30.350> of

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
our hardware on there and again just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.109 
our hardware on there and again just
repeat<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.100> same<00:01:40.280> thing<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.789> other<00:01:40.850> side

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.880 

okay<00:01:47.149> all<00:01:47.869> right<00:01:48.079> means<00:01:48.229> at<00:01:48.349> this<00:01:48.439> point<00:01:48.709> if<00:01:48.859> we

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
okay all right means at this point if we

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.319 
okay all right means at this point if we
go<00:01:49.099> ahead<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.549> tighten<00:01:49.759> down<00:01:49.909> all<00:01:50.030> our

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
go ahead and tighten down all our

00:01:50.329 --> 00:02:02.410 
go ahead and tighten down all our
fasteners<00:02:00.729> once<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.789> have<00:02:01.879> them<00:02:01.969> snug<00:02:02.209> down

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
fasteners once you have them snug down

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.520 
fasteners once you have them snug down
then<00:02:02.599> you<00:02:02.659> go<00:02:02.780> ahead<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.079> give<00:02:03.349> them<00:02:03.409> their

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
then you go ahead and give them their

00:02:03.530 --> 00:03:02.030 
then you go ahead and give them their
final<00:02:03.739> torque

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.129 

okay<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.909> one<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.090> our<00:03:07.150> thought<00:03:07.359> is<00:03:07.420> also<00:03:07.989> if

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
okay and one of our thought is also if

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.240 
okay and one of our thought is also if
you<00:03:08.230> wanted<00:03:08.409> to<00:03:08.500> put<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.769> higher<00:03:08.920> setting

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
you wanted to put on the higher setting

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.440 
you wanted to put on the higher setting
which<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.549> bring<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.819> up<00:03:09.879> file<00:03:10.060> another<00:03:10.209> inch

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
which you bring it up file another inch

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.270 
which you bring it up file another inch
you<00:03:10.689> can<00:03:10.750> actually<00:03:10.989> cut<00:03:11.349> out<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.889> fish<00:03:12.129> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
you can actually cut out the fish you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.199 
you can actually cut out the fish you
