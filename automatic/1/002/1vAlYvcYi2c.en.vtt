00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.560
 today we will teach our dog a 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.010
 draw an 8 under our legs 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.650
 that is, we would like to ask him to position himself 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.910
 in front of us to pass between the legs 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.800
 to come out from behind is again 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.989
 come back to reposition yourself to ours 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.040
 side 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.780
 how well we do everything we will have to 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.100
 get our dog to pass by 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.800
 without any difficulty 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 between the legs it seems a pretty thing 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.050
 simple but this exercise and asks for a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 great great confidence 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.600
 the mails from the dog to us e 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 more when we're going to ask the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.149
 our thai to draw a curve below 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.020
 of us we will ask you to force the 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.570
 spine 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.610
 therefore it will have live especially that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.610
 cute sediments of a certain elasticity 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 let's try because I love with our dog 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 front and we will launch projects in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.480
 better our legs after having them 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.410
 recharged way even for the dog that 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.470
 enough space to carry in the middle 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.000
 let net prizes fall in such a way 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 such that the dog he brought 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.220
 freely thanks to the motivation of 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 prize to pass me in the legs 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 these projects will come 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 progressively moved more and more 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.229
 back so the dog is more 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.820
 soon pass under and were not instead 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.950
 I go around from behind we try to 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.950
 see how to import in this first 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
 music 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.900
 front dog that my plans 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 I let you understand 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.740
 at this point I put the next seed 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.530
 declares as such that the dog 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.530
 of positions next door 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.700
 try again we leave with our dog 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.370
 front again we will launch the first 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.370
 acts under our legs 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:59.610
 so we will guide the dog out and then the dog 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.610
 we will ask by our side 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.270
 when the dog 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.849
 been quite skillful in the streets this 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.370
 exercise we can build the step 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.270
 next and that is and we will ask him 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.060
 just to pass under us but 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.489
 guiding him 4 towards our first here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.810
 we won't launch pipes but we'll keep the prizes 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.319
 in hand and we will give you the races below 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.319
 out 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.660
 and in my project I want the desired dog 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.690
 hook the dog by passing the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.160
 my arm under my next leg 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.920
 when the dog is next to me 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:55.239
 the prize we find we bring back we detach 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.239
 again that dog is ready 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.550
 precisely it rewards him 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.190
 no
