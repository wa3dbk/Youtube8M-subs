knitting I was doing but it's open on
one<00:00:20.210> end<00:00:20.450> so<00:00:20.779> when<00:00:20.930> it<00:00:21.050> comes<00:00:21.290> off<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.529> machine

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
one end so when it comes off the machine

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.450 
one end so when it comes off the machine
it<00:00:22.550> can<00:00:22.790> be<00:00:22.939> opened<00:00:23.599> out<00:00:23.750> like<00:00:24.140> book<00:00:24.560> that

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
it can be opened out like book that

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.030 
it can be opened out like book that
means<00:00:25.880> that<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:26.270> can<00:00:26.480> make<00:00:26.509> a<00:00:26.660> very<00:00:27.050> very<00:00:27.560> wide

piece of knitting by using both beds of
the<00:00:32.509> machine<00:00:32.899> I<00:00:33.170> would<00:00:33.440> be<00:00:33.620> knitting<00:00:33.980> like

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the machine I would be knitting like

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.920 
the machine I would be knitting like
this<00:00:34.690> across<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.290> back<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:37.699> then<00:00:38.149> knit<00:00:38.899> the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
this across and back and then knit the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.340 
this across and back and then knit the
main<00:00:39.289> bed<00:00:39.590> again<00:00:39.980> knit<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.030> river<00:00:41.269> again<00:00:41.750> then

main bed again knit the river again then

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.099 
main bed again knit the river again then
the<00:00:42.500> river<00:00:42.739> again<00:00:43.250> then<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.090> main<00:00:44.300> bed<00:00:44.539> again

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.680 
the river again then the main bed again
I<00:00:45.140> think<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.160> easiest<00:00:46.219> way<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:46.910> show<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.449> is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
I think the easiest way to show this is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.439 
I think the easiest way to show this is
to<00:00:48.260> get<00:00:48.379> busy<00:00:48.829> here's<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.429> needle<00:00:49.820> arrangement

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
to get busy here's a needle arrangement

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.110 
to get busy here's a needle arrangement

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
it cancels the other you can push two

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.640 
it cancels the other you can push two
buttons<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.510> once<00:04:46.540> but<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.050> have<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.380> hold

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
buttons at once but you have to hold

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.850 
buttons at once but you have to hold
them<00:04:47.860> both<00:04:48.040> at<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.370> same<00:04:48.610> time<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:50.020> have

them both at the same time so I have

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.550 
them both at the same time so I have
knitted<00:04:51.720> from<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.950> top<00:04:54.720> over<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:55.990> then<00:04:56.260> on

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
knitted from the top over and then on

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.460 
knitted from the top over and then on
the<00:04:56.770> bottom<00:04:57.190> over<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.000> I'm<00:04:58.150> on<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.480> bottom<00:04:58.630> so

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
the bottom over so I'm on the bottom so

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.010 
the bottom over so I'm on the bottom so
now<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.710> need<00:04:59.920> to<00:05:00.070> knit<00:05:00.400> on<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.550> bottom<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.330> on

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
now I need to knit on the bottom and on

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.040 
now I need to knit on the bottom and on
over<00:05:05.520> here<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.670> something<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.210> think<00:05:07.420> about<00:05:07.600> if

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
over here is something to think about if

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.500 
over here is something to think about if
you<00:05:08.230> should<00:05:08.500> happen<00:05:08.710> to<00:05:09.580> be<00:05:09.730> interrupted

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
you should happen to be interrupted

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.180 
you should happen to be interrupted
because<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:10.960> have<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.230> switch<00:05:11.560> every<00:05:11.980> two

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
because you have to switch every two

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.520 
because you have to switch every two
rows<00:05:12.480> when<00:05:13.480> you<00:05:13.600> come<00:05:13.870> back<00:05:14.080> from<00:05:14.320> your

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
rows when you come back from your

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.090 
rows when you come back from your
interruption<00:05:15.310> look<00:05:16.030> at<00:05:16.300> where<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:17.470> yarn<00:05:17.740> tail

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
interruption look at where the yarn tail

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.550 
interruption look at where the yarn tail
is<00:05:18.370> coming<00:05:18.820> from<00:05:19.120> let's<00:05:19.960> say<00:05:20.230> I've<00:05:20.350> been

that<00:05:40.270> it's<00:05:40.450> coming<00:05:40.750> from<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:41.770> keep<00:05:41.980> track<00:05:42.340> of

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
that it's coming from to keep track of

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.760 
that it's coming from to keep track of
where<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:42.820> am<00:05:42.970> so<00:05:43.930> I'm<00:05:44.050> going<00:05:44.320> to<00:05:44.380> continue

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
where I am so I'm going to continue

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.070 
where I am so I'm going to continue
doing<00:05:45.280> this<00:05:45.430> knitting<00:05:45.850> 2<00:05:46.150> rows<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.690> then

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
doing this knitting 2 rows and then

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.530 
doing this knitting 2 rows and then
switching<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.770> settings<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.400> number<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.270> times

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
switching the settings a number of times

00:05:49.540 --> 00:06:06.719 
switching the settings a number of times
so<00:05:49.810> we'll<00:05:49.960> have<00:05:50.170> a<00:05:50.200> good<00:05:50.470> sample

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:33.989 

I<00:06:30.749> think<00:06:31.749> I've<00:06:31.960> done<00:06:31.990> enough<00:06:32.199> rows<00:06:32.889> to<00:06:33.759> have<00:06:33.969> a

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:33.999 
I think I've done enough rows to have a

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.739 
I think I've done enough rows to have a
good<00:06:34.300> sample<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.259> I'm<00:06:35.409> going<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:35.740> go<00:06:35.949> ahead<00:06:36.339> and

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:36.749 
good sample so I'm going to go ahead and

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:40.950 
good sample so I'm going to go ahead and
cut<00:06:37.749> the<00:06:37.930> yarn<00:06:38.169> I<00:06:38.669> take<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:39.909> sample<00:06:40.419> off<00:06:40.719> the

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
cut the yarn I take the sample off the

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.619 
cut the yarn I take the sample off the
machine<00:06:41.379> with<00:06:42.159> just<00:06:42.399> open<00:06:42.789> stitches<00:06:43.270> at<00:06:43.479> the

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
machine with just open stitches at the

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.499 
machine with just open stitches at the
top<00:06:43.930> by<00:06:44.559> knitting<00:06:44.889> across<00:06:45.159> and<00:06:45.490> down<00:06:45.610> and

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:46.509 
top by knitting across and down and

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.489 
top by knitting across and down and
catching<00:06:47.139> it<00:06:47.309> and<00:06:48.539> then<00:06:49.539> I'm<00:06:49.870> going<00:06:50.139> to<00:06:50.199> put<00:06:50.409> it

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:50.499 
catching it and then I'm going to put it

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.529 
catching it and then I'm going to put it
up<00:06:50.620> on<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.919> machine<00:06:51.069> and<00:06:51.639> show<00:06:51.879> it<00:06:52.029> here's<00:06:52.300> my

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
up on the machine and show it here's my

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.589 
up on the machine and show it here's my
finished<00:06:53.020> sample<00:06:53.969> it's<00:06:54.969> joined<00:06:55.419> at<00:06:55.569> the

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
finished sample it's joined at the

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.570 
finished sample it's joined at the
bottom<00:06:56.050> with<00:06:56.199> the<00:06:56.229> purple<00:06:56.860> this<00:06:57.129> was<00:06:57.370> the

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
bottom with the purple this was the

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.689 
bottom with the purple this was the
zigzag<00:06:58.029> row<00:06:58.300> at<00:06:58.479> the<00:06:58.659> very<00:06:58.870> bottom<00:06:59.139> and
