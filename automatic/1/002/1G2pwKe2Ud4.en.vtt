00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.050
 man stream is not going to possibly do 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.550
 never in life 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.090

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.390
 the wave gentlemen and three years of 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.820
 share laughter and emotions in this 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 place giving them place to relax a 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.860
 Amazing place to relax and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.590
 forget about the sorrows of the world we are going to 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.809
 start with this this game that has 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.150
 wonderful music this game 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.710
 really has master music for 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.080
 make game of game boy believe me very faithful 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.050
 to music the remises very loyal to the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 music of dns obviously this game I have 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.200
 here also simpler than dns 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.159
 but it has a little more trouble 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.990
 Regarding the level design unlike 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.920
 as soldiers of mind needed 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.799
 it was with more longer and many 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.859
 stories I have with this one with this 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.959
 small game the first I could of 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.520
 gameboy remember why 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.310
 which I wanted a game boy was this 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.619
 game in particular this is no other 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.130
 this and after the desire intensified 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.130
 when it came out 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.750
 the mega man the mega man 2 the game boy 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.480
 that is even more chingÃ³n 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.850
 it was a our one the truth the 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.060
 sequel sequels this is total and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.540
 completely great gentlemen once you 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 He advanced them but if I believe how is 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.090
 in the times when I was very 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.700
 I'm going to leave this stay 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 alone in my house and that everyone 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.810
 I was sending care, I was traveling much more 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.810
 as 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 and I turned on the NES and that I wanted to play is 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.000
 mega man 4k I feel when they turn it on 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.340
 it was time to leave someone's mother 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.780
 and he takes care of me as if he were not going to open 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.460
 the drawer of the cutlery and out 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.860
 fit a knife in the morra is not 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.620
 some bullshit about style 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.840
 and they passed occupational accidents 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.840
 because already very special issues 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 to perfect they did not hit me to sones if 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 very special questions and I always 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.760
 they always carried the lights on for 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.790
 the famicom in my case because I had a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.569
 fam and that they saw me that there was 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.690
 bought family that was in lands 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.690
 Japanese 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.069
 OK perfect 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.860
 and they liked that if in land 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.860
 Japanese I remember well 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.680
 and that was for a long time 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.330
 a game boy precisely to call 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.190
 to be able to continue playing mega man where 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.140
 where I was without caring what does not happen 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.000
 until a long time ago that I did not 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.580
 they bought but I saved for a game 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 boy 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.400
 which had criminal in the erased and 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.840
 buy precisely all megaman 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.880
 buy in accordance 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.730
 in our inch markets I bought 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.970
 a game boy this life 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.830
 the Japanese Japanese edition one of those 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.019
 of those who when they opened the little 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.879
 center back then in that 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.629
 then it was as soon as they opened in it 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.629
 because he found out about everything 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.320
 I say for those who know that it's a bit 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.320
 center no mamen 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.209
 but if I remember back then 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.070
 it was a special vision and there was another one that 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.350
 it was from pikachu he already had the golden 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.820

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.750

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.510
 already there was already this one until there was 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.970
 5 in this desmadre ice man is quite 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.850
 simple but if they are wrong, share them 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.090

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.090
 low
