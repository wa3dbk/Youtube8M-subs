00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.350
 hello and welcome to yonne 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.099
 today I offered you the train 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:19.990
 of gun then different the moment apart 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.110
 from the 10 km the 35 60 80 100 for all 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.110
 likes 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 how 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.530
 yeah 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250
 m 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.970
 and here we go for 18 35 km 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.310
 so first portion of nature nicolas 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.160
 it's still going yeah it's worth it for 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.490
 the moment it is 6 m it is still this 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.650
 pretty pretty break yes we feel everything from 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.250
 following the city we find ourselves 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.250
 directly in nature 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.110
 so we adopted the rhythm trailer 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.940
 that is, teacher market 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:43.130
 unlike some who runs this 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:47.420
 first coast left some traces 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.420
 woe to those who left too quickly 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.630
 so to the antennas name and the police there 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 wait here is December so a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.530
 equally abrupt descent that was 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530
 in the inked 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.629
 so bowels the technique is to 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.140
 to rely on cardio 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:27.409
 watch the watch and sometimes 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.430
 to walk or run, choose 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.959
 and in this case then for example then 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.920
 merchant 340 2 144 pulsations which 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.579
 is almost a frequent mast 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.790
 on the marathon 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.099
 so you imagine it's better a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.049
 little bit walk recover otherwise I 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.209
 are going to ride really too much is you 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.209
 maybe explode andreu 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.420
 and here we are at three kilometers 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.209
 of arrival 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.140
 a beautiful little coast where everyone 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.830
 walk no there is no hesitation 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.830
 it's ugly for everyone 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.750
 so I come to the top of this coast 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.630
 endless and we were promised a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.880
 beautiful panorama I hope the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.880
 reward will be the height of the effort 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.150
 and here we see meaning behind with 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.150
 the cathedral behind the river unyon 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 so beautiful the rescue is close 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.710
 since as soon as we are up we go 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.050
 switch and join the finish then 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.440
 on the other hand for a last coast 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:04.080
 it's a sacred piece even when walking 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.080
 it's difficult so you have to hang on 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.310
 christelle who is next to me 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.580
 has just learned that she leads 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.650
 women and magically it goes back to 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.500
 fundamentally the fund even the mind that 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:24.170
 cooing we are more than normally 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.950
 to stress roll up to the finish then 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.950
 here it will be buckled 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:48.060
 they have come direct to the crisis such 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:05:00.870
 thank you the fia a cost assumed to raise all 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.970
 for me the 18th it's over I had no 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.370
 badly of pleasure since once again 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.840
 it was a race without ambition just 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.020
 for the pleasure of being there and 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.240
 participate so I recommend it 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.010
 it's a race that is really very 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.430
 beautiful and very well organized so 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.430
 next year
