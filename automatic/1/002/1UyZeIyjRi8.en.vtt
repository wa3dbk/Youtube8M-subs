through window I basically just wanted
to<00:00:29.720> clear<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.869> some<00:00:30.900> things<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> you

might have been having a problem with
you'll<00:00:34.200> remember<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> end<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.130> the

tutorial

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.780 
tutorial
I<00:00:36.980> explained<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.910> how<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:40.200> add<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.790> box

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
I explained to you how to just add a box

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
I explained to you how to just add a box
with<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.270> aperture<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.170> an<00:00:43.530> aerial<00:00:43.920> lamp

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
with an aperture and an aerial lamp

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
with an aperture and an aerial lamp
inside<00:00:44.750> now<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.170> might<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.410> had<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
inside now some of you might have had a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.799 
inside now some of you might have had a
problem<00:00:46.890> getting<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> shadows<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.420> show<00:00:48.660> up

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
problem getting the shadows to show up

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.630 
problem getting the shadows to show up
so<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:51.590> rear-ended<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> whole<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so I've rear-ended this whole thing and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
so I've rear-ended this whole thing and
this<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> result<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.180> what<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> did<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this is the result and what I did was I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.270 
this is the result and what I did was I
made<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.340> two<00:00:59.609> left<00:00:59.960> windows<00:01:01.010> have<00:01:02.010> less

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
made the two left windows have less

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
made the two left windows have less
light<00:01:02.579> coming<00:01:02.940> through<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
light coming through so that you can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
light coming through so that you can
just<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.210> ability<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.390> control<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
just see the ability to control the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130 
just see the ability to control the
individual<00:01:07.619> lights<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.510> rays<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.930> well

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
individual lights and the rays as well

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
individual lights and the rays as well
which<00:01:10.470> I'll<00:01:10.680> list<00:01:11.040> them<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> projected

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
which I'll list them and the projected

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
which I'll list them and the projected
light<00:01:12.479> onto<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> ground<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
light onto the ground as well this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.200 
light onto the ground as well this
probably<00:01:15.420> could<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> little<00:01:16.170> dimmer

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
probably could be a little dimmer

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
probably could be a little dimmer
relating<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> light<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.140> anyway

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
relating to the light there but anyway

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
relating to the light there but anyway
that<00:01:19.950> gives<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> idea<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.850> moved<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that gives you the idea I moved the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.460 
that gives you the idea I moved the
plant<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.189> got<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:24.030> Lynn<00:01:24.270> Swap<00:01:24.659> Potomac

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
plant which I got from Lynn Swap Potomac

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
plant which I got from Lynn Swap Potomac
16<00:01:26.040> mice<00:01:26.880> model<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> moved<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
16 mice model they I moved it to the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.450 
16 mice model they I moved it to the
center<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
center and in this way we can see the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.600 
center and in this way we can see the
shadows<00:01:32.630> alright<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.990> let's<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
shadows alright so let's just have a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
shadows alright so let's just have a
look<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.380> went<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:39.290> let<00:01:40.290> me<00:01:40.380> go

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
look at how we went about this let me go

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.630 
look at how we went about this let me go
into<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.130> node<00:01:41.700> editor<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.430> basically<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
into the node editor and basically all I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
into the node editor and basically all I
did<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:46.340> added<00:01:47.340> another<00:01:47.700> three<00:01:48.770> boxes<00:01:49.770> with

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
did was I added another three boxes with

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.520 
did was I added another three boxes with
the<00:01:50.189> apertures<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.180> area<00:01:51.509> lamps<00:01:51.899> for

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the apertures and the area lamps for

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270 
the apertures and the area lamps for
each<00:01:52.680> individual<00:01:53.369> ray<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.880> window<00:01:55.189> and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
each individual ray or window and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
each individual ray or window and
and<00:01:57.369> all<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:57.880> did<00:01:58.030> was<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:59.040> said<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:01.830> window

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and all I did was I said the window

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.040 
and all I did was I said the window
mission<00:02:05.009> strength<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.400> one<00:02:06.640> as<00:02:06.940> opposed<00:02:07.750> to

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
mission strength to be one as opposed to

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.740 
mission strength to be one as opposed to
the<00:02:08.619> one<00:02:08.770> on<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.039> right<00:02:09.280> which<00:02:09.550> was<00:02:09.759> 25<00:02:10.390> so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
the one on the right which was 25 so

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.210 
the one on the right which was 25 so
that<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:11.800> have<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.040> brighter<00:02:13.530> ray<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.980> side

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that we have a brighter ray on that side

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.840 
that we have a brighter ray on that side
and<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:16.390> course<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.380> other<00:02:18.190> left<00:02:18.430> one<00:02:18.700> as

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and of course on the other left one as

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.710 
and of course on the other left one as
well<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> said<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:20.110> one<00:02:20.680> as<00:02:20.890> well<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.720> then

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
well I said that to one as well and then

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.729 
well I said that to one as well and then
the<00:02:23.200> lamps<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:25.690> we<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:26.020> into<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.530> lamp

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
the lamps if we go into the lamp

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.040 
the lamps if we go into the lamp
properties<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:28.030> area<00:02:28.330> lamp<00:02:28.540> here<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
properties the area lamp here the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.680 
properties the area lamp here the
strength<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.500> set<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.100> tin<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.700> opposed

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
strength of set that to tin as opposed

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.130 
strength of set that to tin as opposed
to<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.620> ones<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> right<00:02:33.340> which<00:02:34.120> are<00:02:34.330> at<00:02:34.570> 50

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
to the ones on the right which are at 50

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.820 
to the ones on the right which are at 50
and<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.640> rice<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.600> said<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.230> left<00:02:38.590> right

and in the rice I said the left right

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.100 
and in the rice I said the left right
2.1<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.970> left<00:02:40.150> rice<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.690> eight<00:02:40.810> two<00:02:40.959> point

2.1 the left rice the eight two point
one<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:42.970> emission<00:02:43.600> strength

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
one and the right emission strength

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.449 
one and the right emission strength
could<00:02:44.739> be<00:02:44.890> 0.3<00:02:45.930> all<00:02:46.930> right<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.950> basically

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
could be 0.3 all right so that basically

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.600 
could be 0.3 all right so that basically
is<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.800> what<00:02:50.800> I'm<00:02:50.890> going<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.100> do<00:02:51.280> now<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.489> just

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
is it what I'm going to do now is just

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.640 
is it what I'm going to do now is just

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
we have the lightener out of you

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.000 
we have the lightener out of you
right<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:28.480> let's<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:28.750> see<00:03:29.019> how<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.260> adjust

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
right so let's just see how we adjust

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.680 
right so let's just see how we adjust
the<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:31.590> projected<00:03:32.590> light<00:03:33.239> I'm<00:03:34.239> just<00:03:34.510> going

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the the projected light I'm just going

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.630 
the the projected light I'm just going
to<00:03:34.810> select<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:36.160> aperture<00:03:36.670> here<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.549> I'm

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
to select this aperture here so I'm

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.210 
to select this aperture here so I'm
going<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.269> go<00:03:40.450> into<00:03:40.720> tab<00:03:41.019> mode<00:03:41.290> before<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.100> do

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
going to go into tab mode before you do

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.210 
going to go into tab mode before you do
also<00:03:42.400> make<00:03:42.670> sure<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.940> your<00:03:43.829> pivot<00:03:44.829> point<00:03:45.070> is

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
also make sure that your pivot point is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.770 
also make sure that your pivot point is
set<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.519> medium<00:03:45.700> points<00:03:46.239> because<00:03:46.630> you're

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
set to medium points because you're

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.680 
set to medium points because you're
going<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:46.989> be<00:03:47.140> adjusting<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.420> vertices<00:03:49.420> which

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
going to be adjusting the vertices which

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.240 
going to be adjusting the vertices which
you<00:03:49.840> would<00:03:49.959> have<00:03:50.049> had<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.200> select<00:03:50.530> here<00:03:51.010> in

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
you would have had to select here in

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.490 
you would have had to select here in
that<00:03:51.549> aperture<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.359> then<00:03:53.109> I'm<00:03:53.230> going<00:03:53.380> to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
that aperture and then I'm going to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.460 
that aperture and then I'm going to
press<00:03:53.680> s<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.370> scale<00:03:55.000> them<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:56.109> can<00:03:56.290> see

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
press s to scale them and you can see

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.949 
press s to scale them and you can see
immediately<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.840> viewport<00:03:58.840> day<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.290> the

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
immediately in the viewport day that the

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.660 
immediately in the viewport day that the
projected<00:04:01.959> light<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.829> too<00:04:03.070> large<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.640> we

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
projected light is is too large and we

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.110 
projected light is is too large and we
just<00:04:04.060> need<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.420> adjust<00:04:04.750> down<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.459> size<00:04:06.730> of

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
just need to adjust down to the size of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.170 
just need to adjust down to the size of
the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.930 
the
base<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.019> array<00:04:09.290> on<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.920> floor<00:04:10.159> and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
base of the array on the floor and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.569 
base of the array on the floor and
that's<00:04:11.120> what<00:04:11.299> I've<00:04:11.450> done<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:16.070> other<00:04:16.280> way

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
that's what I've done and the other way

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.430 
that's what I've done and the other way
that<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.850> can<00:04:17.000> actually<00:04:17.359> do<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.930> as<00:04:18.229> well

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
that you can actually do this as well

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.100 
that you can actually do this as well
adjusting<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:20.859> size<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:22.760> by<00:04:23.090> moving<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.720> area

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
adjusting the size is by moving the area

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.040 
adjusting the size is by moving the area
lamp<00:04:24.320> up<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.830> down<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.270> can<00:04:26.540> just<00:04:26.690> grab<00:04:26.990> it

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
lamp up and down so you can just grab it

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.939 
lamp up and down so you can just grab it
by<00:04:27.470> placing<00:04:28.100> G<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.610> Z<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.210> then<00:04:29.990> manipulating

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
by placing G and Z and then manipulating

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.159 
by placing G and Z and then manipulating
it<00:04:31.070> up<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:32.000> you'll<00:04:32.300> notice<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> viewport

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
it up and you'll notice in the viewport

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.189 
it up and you'll notice in the viewport
chatter<00:04:33.380> again<00:04:33.669> you<00:04:34.669> put<00:04:35.169> there<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
chatter again you put there that the

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.840 
chatter again you put there that the
size<00:04:39.199> is<00:04:39.229> reduced<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.280> if<00:04:40.400> we<00:04:40.520> bring<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.820> down

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
size is reduced and if we bring it down

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.110 
size is reduced and if we bring it down
it's<00:04:41.449> enlarged<00:04:41.990> but<00:04:42.590> generally<00:04:43.010> it's<00:04:43.610> easier

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
it's enlarged but generally it's easier

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.110 
it's enlarged but generally it's easier
just<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.419> adjust<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.380> as<00:04:46.370> better<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.820> adjust

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
just to adjust the as better to adjust

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.270 
just to adjust the as better to adjust
the<00:04:47.300> aperture<00:04:47.630> because<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.169> might<00:04:48.350> have<00:04:49.130> to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
the aperture because you might have to

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.820 
the aperture because you might have to
bring<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.669> lamp<00:04:49.850> too<00:04:50.090> high<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.590> the

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
want to grab the block the lamp outside

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.100 
want to grab the block the lamp outside
of<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.250> box<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.639> must<00:04:58.789> be<00:04:58.880> inside<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.570> box

and<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:02.000> that's<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.750> then<00:05:04.180> what<00:05:05.180> you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
and so that's that and then what you

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.029 
and so that's that and then what you
also<00:05:05.360> want<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.930> do<00:05:06.350> is<00:05:07.990> I'd<00:05:08.990> be<00:05:09.260> able<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.590> adjust

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
also want to do is I'd be able to adjust

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.370 
also want to do is I'd be able to adjust
the<00:05:11.289> blur<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.830> edges<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:14.380> projected

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
the blur the edges of this projected

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.129 
the blur the edges of this projected
light<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:16.070> so<00:05:16.310> how<00:05:16.550> do<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.820> do<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.180> right<00:05:17.479> if

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
light and so how do we do that right if

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.200 
light and so how do we do that right if
you<00:05:18.320> go<00:05:18.470> into<00:05:18.889> if<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.490> remember<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.940> spot

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
you go into if you remember the spot

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.719 
you go into if you remember the spot
light<00:05:20.510> you<00:05:21.349> remember<00:05:22.160> that<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.430> could<00:05:22.610> adjust

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
light you remember that you could adjust

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.370 
light you remember that you could adjust
the<00:05:23.690> size<00:05:24.080> of<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.800> shadow<00:05:25.389> and<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:27.050> spot

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
the size of the shadow and the spot

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.379 
the size of the shadow and the spot
shape<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.940> had<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.330> blend<00:05:29.800> adjustment<00:05:30.800> here

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
shape you had the blend adjustment here

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.650 
shape you had the blend adjustment here
well<00:05:32.389> with<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:33.490> area<00:05:34.490> lamp<00:05:34.700> you<00:05:35.150> have<00:05:35.360> the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
well with the area lamp you have the

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.810 
well with the area lamp you have the
setting<00:05:36.139> the<00:05:36.320> shape<00:05:37.280> is<00:05:37.580> rectangle<00:05:38.449> or<00:05:38.690> square

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
setting the shape is rectangle or square

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.390 
setting the shape is rectangle or square
to<00:05:40.820> set<00:05:41.030> it<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.150> square<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:42.410> make<00:05:42.590> sure<00:05:43.030> that

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
to set it to square and make sure that

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.450 
to set it to square and make sure that
you<00:05:46.400> set<00:05:46.970> this<00:05:48.699> below<00:05:50.229> one<00:05:51.229> okay<00:05:52.099> because<00:05:52.280> if

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
you set this below one okay because if

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.820 
you set this below one okay because if
you<00:05:52.580> put<00:05:52.789> those<00:05:52.940> two<00:05:53.000> one<00:05:53.449> here<00:05:53.750> this<00:05:54.500> is<00:05:54.560> what

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
you put those two one here this is what

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.210 
you put those two one here this is what
happens<00:05:55.270> all<00:05:56.270> right<00:05:56.410> now<00:05:57.410> if<00:05:57.740> we<00:05:57.860> start<00:05:57.919> at

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
happens all right now if we start at

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.010 
happens all right now if we start at
zero<00:05:58.870> we<00:05:59.870> get<00:06:00.020> an<00:06:00.169> absolutely<00:06:00.650> sharp<00:06:01.630> edge<00:06:02.630> to

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
zero we get an absolutely sharp edge to

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.379 
zero we get an absolutely sharp edge to
it<00:06:04.270> by<00:06:05.270> bringing<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:06.229> to<00:06:06.440> point<00:06:06.740> zero<00:06:07.130> zero

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
it by bringing it to point zero zero

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.010 
it by bringing it to point zero zero
let's<00:06:08.720> set<00:06:08.870> point<00:06:09.110> zero<00:06:09.320> zero<00:06:09.410> two<00:06:10.690> you<00:06:11.690> start

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
let's set point zero zero two you start

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.779 
let's set point zero zero two you start
seeing<00:06:12.320> a<00:06:12.440> little<00:06:12.530> bit<00:06:12.710> of<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.979> fuzzy<00:06:13.190> edge<00:06:13.520> to

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
seeing a little bit of a fuzzy edge to

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.860 
seeing a little bit of a fuzzy edge to
it<00:06:13.910> and<00:06:15.280> point<00:06:16.280> zero<00:06:16.610> two<00:06:16.940> is<00:06:17.300> what

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
it and point zero two is what

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.550 
it and point zero two is what
sent<00:06:18.140> it<00:06:18.290> for<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:19.120> gives<00:06:20.120> you<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.270> more

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
sent it for this gives you a more

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.430 
sent it for this gives you a more
blurred<00:06:21.560> edge<00:06:22.720> so<00:06:23.720> that's<00:06:24.560> how<00:06:25.160> that<00:06:25.220> works

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
blurred edge so that's how that works

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.320 
blurred edge so that's how that works
and<00:06:27.850> all<00:06:28.850> of<00:06:29.030> this<00:06:30.310> was<00:06:31.310> done<00:06:31.340> without<00:06:31.820> any

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
and all of this was done without any

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:40.090 
and all of this was done without any
compositing<00:06:33.200> stall<00:06:35.440> which<00:06:36.440> is<00:06:36.770> quite<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:39.100> good

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
compositing stall which is quite a good

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.120 
compositing stall which is quite a good
thing<00:06:40.690> if<00:06:41.690> you<00:06:41.840> don't<00:06:41.990> like<00:06:42.230> compositing<00:06:42.890> like

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
thing if you don't like compositing like

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.280 
thing if you don't like compositing like
me<00:06:43.690> alright

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
me alright

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.620 
me alright
it<00:06:45.740> is<00:06:45.950> a<00:06:45.980> bit<00:06:46.220> noisy<00:06:46.370> but<00:06:46.640> that<00:06:47.060> is<00:06:47.180> not<00:06:47.300> too

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
it is a bit noisy but that is not too

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.550 
it is a bit noisy but that is not too
bad<00:06:47.870> considering<00:06:48.410> that<00:06:49.870> this<00:06:50.870> was<00:06:51.080> rendered<00:06:51.470> I

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
bad considering that this was rendered I

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.760 
bad considering that this was rendered I
think<00:06:51.830> at<00:06:51.980> 20<00:06:52.400> samples<00:06:53.030> or<00:06:53.450> may<00:06:53.600> be<00:06:53.660> wrong<00:06:53.930> and

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
think at 20 samples or may be wrong and

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.060 
think at 20 samples or may be wrong and
it<00:06:55.700> took<00:06:55.820> about<00:06:55.970> 21<00:06:56.450> minutes<00:06:56.690> you'll<00:06:57.680> notice

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
it took about 21 minutes you'll notice

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.740 
it took about 21 minutes you'll notice
that<00:06:58.220> I've<00:06:58.400> selected<00:06:58.610> instead<00:06:59.360> of<00:06:59.480> path

this was rendered the limited global
illumination<00:07:16.250> was<00:07:16.730> selected<00:07:17.710> if<00:07:18.710> you<00:07:18.920> want<00:07:19.130> to

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
illumination was selected if you want to

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.670 
illumination was selected if you want to
make<00:07:19.880> the<00:07:22.270> image<00:07:23.270> more<00:07:23.300> dark<00:07:23.840> like<00:07:24.110> this<00:07:24.350> then

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
make the image more dark like this then

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.190 
make the image more dark like this then
obviously<00:07:24.980> direct<00:07:25.700> light<00:07:26.030> will<00:07:26.870> give<00:07:27.020> a<00:07:27.050> more

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
obviously direct light will give a more

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.420 
obviously direct light will give a more
dramatic<00:07:27.410> effect<00:07:29.620> okay<00:07:30.620> so<00:07:30.950> you<00:07:31.490> can<00:07:31.670> see<00:07:31.700> the

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430 
dramatic effect okay so you can see the

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.100 
dramatic effect okay so you can see the
shadows<00:07:34.430> are<00:07:34.610> quite<00:07:34.910> nasty<00:07:35.120> it's<00:07:35.870> even

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
shadows are quite nasty it's even

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.040 
shadows are quite nasty it's even

variation of of different rays also

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.290 
variation of of different rays also
gives<00:07:46.310> it<00:07:46.460> a<00:07:46.550> more<00:07:46.760> natural<00:07:46.790> look<00:07:47.420> as<00:07:47.630> well

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300 
gives it a more natural look as well

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.660
