the<00:01:50.419> wood<00:01:50.630> because<00:01:50.989> I<00:01:51.200> think<00:01:51.319> there's<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:51.799> 4

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
the wood because I think there's like 4

million<00:01:52.549> wood<00:01:52.880> there<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:54.799> we<00:01:55.009> got<00:01:55.159> to

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
million wood there and so we we got to

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:59.109 
million wood there and so we we got to
wait<00:01:55.459> until<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:57.770> find<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.130> way<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.369> use<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.880> wood

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
wait until we find a way to use the wood

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.419 
wait until we find a way to use the wood
and<00:01:59.389> then<00:01:59.659> once<00:02:00.259> we<00:02:00.409> do<00:02:00.559> that<00:02:00.770> we<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.159> send

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
and then once we do that we can send

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.510 
and then once we do that we can send
toothless<00:02:01.939> on<00:02:02.149> his<00:02:02.509> way<00:02:02.779> but<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:03.919> is<00:02:04.219> pretty

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520

again

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
again

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.890 
again
it<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.690> August<00:02:09.220> 22nd<00:02:10.220> 2014<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.480> they<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.719> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
it is August 22nd 2014 and they have the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.069 
it is August 22nd 2014 and they have the
cloud<00:02:12.140> jumper<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.120> some<00:02:14.120> other<00:02:14.239> dragons<00:02:14.840> I

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
cloud jumper and some other dragons I

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.320 
cloud jumper and some other dragons I
think<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.069> main<00:02:16.250> dragon<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.760> want

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
think the main dragon you want

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.120 
think the main dragon you want
probably<00:02:17.720> cloud<00:02:17.960> jumper<00:02:18.380> available<00:02:18.890> for

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
probably cloud jumper available for

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.870 
probably cloud jumper available for
three<00:02:19.400> days<00:02:19.640> until<00:02:20.260> Monday<00:02:21.580> yeah

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
three days until Monday yeah

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.030 
three days until Monday yeah
so<00:02:23.270> if<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.540> didn't<00:02:23.840> get<00:02:24.080> cloud<00:02:24.440> jumper<00:02:24.890> be

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
so if you didn't get cloud jumper be

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.190 
so if you didn't get cloud jumper be
sure<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.640> get<00:02:25.820> try<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> cloud<00:02:26.840> jumper

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
sure to get try to get the cloud jumper

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.990
