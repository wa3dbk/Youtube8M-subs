00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.509
 that where there is everyone here we see them with 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.360
 this unboxing of this extension of 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:12.730
 batteries for the canon of 273 74 and 75 and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.920
 between t4 and tf-5 and I'm not very 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.660
 sure that he will grab for certain 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.050
 versions of the software that has the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.300
 camera so what's going on what's going to 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.390
 installed well installs well but 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.880
 It depends on the software if you can use it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.100
 good in steam boxing is very simple 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.429
 it's simply the extension and joining the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.399
 accessories that is to use two batteries 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:40.350
 the camera and use double batteries to also to 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:44.319
 the time but and from there there's nothing else 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.870
 they are manual just how to install it 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:50.469
 near the product and in a lot of 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:54.129
 languages ​​as always and another paper that goes 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.199
 to be about the brand that is make the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.889
 makers the mind I think the best brand 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:03.249
 of this one of this kind of extension of 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:06.280
 batteries compared to the canon but 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.290
 in itself I think it works better because 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.440
 it comes to cost as only as a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.150
 fraction of the price of canola so 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.369
 many prefer to buy it at a price 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.830
 cheaper because it's still almost the 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.530
 Same quality nothing bad unlike 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.470
 this one to the camera is like the plastic 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 it's a little bit blacker and like it sounds 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.810
 a little more hollow than the camera 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.649
 this is the extension of double batteries 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.750
 to use 6 and the other extension is 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.479
 simply an extension of the batteries 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.030
 that already uses the camera that is going to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.830
 be those that are of the canon and in this 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.990
 nothing more is enough to return them and as 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.710
 always if they're two it's just going 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.289
 make twice the capacity of the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.420
 batteries that you're going to have to be so 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.800
 as the unboxing was very short there is that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 move to the installation once 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.400
 The first thing I'm going to do is a canon 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.800
 of 35 and just the new thing that you're going to 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.670
 have to use is going to be first to take 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.890
 the battery door of the camera if 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.470
 already use the insurance camera you know in 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.690
 where are they to remove it simply 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.860
 you need to put it at a certain angle 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.660
 I think it's like a 45 degree angle 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.060
 to remove it and once it has 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.400
 come out simply is not going to break 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.370
 it's just going to be like a noise from 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.069
 that went out 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.810
 and something very good about this extension is 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.569
 that a compartment is already coming 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.970
 guard the door I've seen that many of 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.220
 those of the battery extensions that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.560
 they do not have this function 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.019
 users end up losing the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.299
 so it's very good that you look for 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.730
 a battery extension that comes with 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.760
 with the compartment to store the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 so remove the battery because of 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.129
 there the extension is going to connect and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.410
 simply connect it using where 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.440
 is the battery and where is the connection 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.510
 what you use to use it in the drive bots 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.160
 and in those things in the triples and we 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.049
 mont monoliths or three feet or these 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.299
 things just the ones you use to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.489
 connect it to the camera the good thing is that 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.970
 you will not lose it because you already have one 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.680
 in the extension of the battery well 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.010
 that you do not have to worry about 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.230
 that so with this that with this 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.200
 extension I also bought a series of 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.299
 batteries that have more energy than those of 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.260
 the canon and I also bought them because 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.810
 they have very good reviews 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.790
 that they are very good and that they have the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.970
 same quality as meat but with 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.370
 the exception that they have more pile like that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.799
 that nothing else is going to install if you go to 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.930
 use double batteries simply use 6 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.299
 batteries and you install it as well as I am 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.269
 doing and it's going to be all that you're going to 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.760
 occupy doing the good of this extension 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.220
 of battery is that it will be your camera that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.859
 be larger if only if you want 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.049
 because it allows you to grab the best 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.030
 with the hand and also have the function 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.989
 that they have the buttons to use 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.170
 photos to take people and all that well 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.420
 that in itself to make the camera more 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.729
 big and having more pile is very good and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.139
 also it did not cost much this has been all 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.139
 for this video and see you
