has already got a failed fun which is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.790 
has already got a failed fun which is
pretty<00:01:54.420> disappointing<00:01:54.720> build<00:01:55.409> quality<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
pretty disappointing build quality I

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.330 
pretty disappointing build quality I
must<00:01:56.070> say<00:01:57.620> working<00:01:58.620> our<00:01:58.860> way<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.010> we've<00:01:59.190> got<00:01:59.220> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
must say working our way up we've got a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.620 
must say working our way up we've got a
little<00:01:59.580> vent<00:01:59.760> there<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.060> allow<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.360> airflow

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
little vent there to allow for airflow

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
little vent there to allow for airflow
and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.170> we've<00:02:01.290> got<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.560> inputs<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.159> is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and then we've got two inputs which is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.480 
and then we've got two inputs which is
an<00:02:02.430> XLR<00:02:02.940> Jack<00:02:03.420> combi<00:02:04.080> input<00:02:04.500> per<00:02:04.680> behind<00:02:05.400> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
an XLR Jack combi input per behind this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.430 
an XLR Jack combi input per behind this
plastic<00:02:05.850> cover<00:02:05.940> here<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.990> take<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.260> off

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
plastic cover here so just take this off

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.169 
plastic cover here so just take this off
for<00:02:07.620> you

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
for you

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
for you
it's<00:02:09.179> an<00:02:09.300> XLR<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.110> which<00:02:10.349> allows<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.800> feed

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it's an XLR out which allows you to feed

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.089 
it's an XLR out which allows you to feed
the<00:02:11.579> line<00:02:12.060> signal<00:02:12.569> down<00:02:12.780> towards<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.439> subwoofer

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
the line signal down towards a subwoofer

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.220 
the line signal down towards a subwoofer
or<00:02:14.400> chained<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.359> another<00:02:15.569> speaker<00:02:16.019> if<00:02:16.170> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
or chained it to another speaker if you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.959 
or chained it to another speaker if you
did<00:02:16.469> wish<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
did wish to

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.059 
did wish to
two<00:02:18.969> LED<00:02:19.480> indicators<00:02:20.110> indicate<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> power

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
two LED indicators indicate the power

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.309 
two LED indicators indicate the power
which<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.579> green<00:02:21.969> LED<00:02:22.450> there<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.870> a

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
which is the green LED there and a

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.869 
which is the green LED there and a
signal<00:02:23.650> limit<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.219> that<00:02:24.370> will<00:02:24.459> illuminate

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
signal limit so that will illuminate

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.550 
signal limit so that will illuminate
when<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.510> start<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.840> push<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.170> speaker's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
when you start to push the speaker's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.470 
when you start to push the speaker's
towards<00:02:26.980> their<00:02:27.099> limits<00:02:27.459> there<00:02:27.640> There<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
towards their limits there There is

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.929 
towards their limits there There is
obviously<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:29.140> contour<00:02:29.799> on/off<00:02:30.340> switch<00:02:30.670> there

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
obviously a contour on/off switch there

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.300 
obviously a contour on/off switch there
and<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.810> then<00:02:31.989> what<00:02:32.109> this<00:02:32.319> does<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.950> boosts

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and now then what this does is it boosts

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.729 
and now then what this does is it boosts
the<00:02:33.459> highs<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.299> lows<00:02:34.510> wreak<00:02:34.810> winces<00:02:35.170> -

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
the highs and the lows wreak winces -

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.530 
the highs and the lows wreak winces -
supposedly<00:02:36.310> give<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> better<00:02:36.970> sound<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.420> it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
supposedly give you a better sound of it

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.270 
supposedly give you a better sound of it
I'll<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:37.930> honest<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.379> have<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.829> pushed<00:02:39.099> in

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
I'll be honest I do have that pushed in

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.449 
I'll be honest I do have that pushed in
most<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.909> time<00:02:40.409> however<00:02:41.409> it<00:02:41.829> does<00:02:42.069> tend<00:02:42.310> to

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
most of the time however it does tend to

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.160 
most of the time however it does tend to
drive<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.879> towards<00:02:42.939> clip<00:02:43.359> earlier<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.930> I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
drive it towards clip earlier so I

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.059 
drive it towards clip earlier so I
sometimes<00:02:45.159> like<00:02:45.639> to<00:02:45.700> keep<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.769> eq's<00:02:47.769> on<00:02:47.920> this

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
sometimes like to keep the eq's on this

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.099 
sometimes like to keep the eq's on this
or<00:02:48.219> the<00:02:48.340> contour<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.909> say<00:02:49.120> off<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:49.959> then

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
or the contour so to say off and then

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.470 
or the contour so to say off and then
just<00:02:50.319> use<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> mixer<00:02:50.859> for<00:02:50.889> EQ<00:02:51.459> up<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.269> ground

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
just use a mixer for EQ up in the ground

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.059 
just use a mixer for EQ up in the ground
I'm<00:02:52.659> not<00:02:52.720> too<00:02:53.079> sure<00:02:53.290> about<00:02:53.349> but<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.769> believe

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
I'm not too sure about but I believe

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.869 
I'm not too sure about but I believe
that's<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.670> swapping<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.510> signal<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
that's for swapping the signal for the

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.179 
that's for swapping the signal for the
output<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.689> believe<00:02:59.260> I've<00:02:59.439> heard<00:02:59.829> somewhere

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
output and believe I've heard somewhere

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.710 
output and believe I've heard somewhere
if<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.609> a<00:03:00.639> home<00:03:00.879> in<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> output<00:03:01.599> or

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
if you have a home in the output or

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.909 
if you have a home in the output or
something<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.079> that<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.349> change<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.739> on

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
something like that to change that on

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.440 
something like that to change that on
but<00:03:03.340> I'm<00:03:03.459> not<00:03:03.609> too<00:03:03.849> sure<00:03:03.879> myself

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
but I'm not too sure myself

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.659 
but I'm not too sure myself

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
school of 120 pupils and so I was

pushing<00:03:49.840> them<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.079> little<00:03:50.379> bit<00:03:50.470> there<00:03:50.620> they<00:03:50.799> did

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
pushing them a little bit there they did

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.750 
pushing them a little bit there they did
clip<00:03:51.569> on<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:53.139> honestly<00:03:53.500> if<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.400> was<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.639> do

clip on that so honestly if I was to do

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.240 
clip on that so honestly if I was to do
that<00:03:54.909> again<00:03:55.229> I'd<00:03:56.229> probably<00:03:56.470> use<00:03:56.889> my<00:03:57.040> nice<00:03:57.220> big

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250

15-inch<00:03:57.940> warf<00:03:58.150> Dale's<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.769> that's<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:01.299> bad

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
15-inch warf Dale's and that's not bad

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.050 
15-inch warf Dale's and that's not bad
at<00:04:01.629> all<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.189> honestly<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.459> bass<00:04:03.790> response

said<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.660> downsides<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.470> me<00:05:59.620> seems<00:05:59.919> to<00:06:00.070> be<00:06:00.160> the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
said the downsides to me seems to be the

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.240 
said the downsides to me seems to be the
build<00:06:00.430> quality<00:06:00.639> unfortunately<00:06:05.039> that's<00:06:06.039> a

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
build quality unfortunately that's a

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.340 
build quality unfortunately that's a
very<00:06:06.460> flimsy<00:06:07.030> I'm<00:06:07.389> not<00:06:07.539> pushing<00:06:07.720> hard<00:06:08.080> even

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
very flimsy I'm not pushing hard even

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.320 
very flimsy I'm not pushing hard even
though<00:06:08.530> it's<00:06:08.650> my<00:06:08.740> thoughts<00:06:09.039> I'm<00:06:09.669> not<00:06:10.000> giving

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
though it's my thoughts I'm not giving

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.420 
though it's my thoughts I'm not giving
it<00:06:10.419> a<00:06:10.450> lot<00:06:10.600> of<00:06:10.720> pushing<00:06:11.410> but<00:06:11.770> that<00:06:11.889> grille<00:06:12.190> is

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
it a lot of pushing but that grille is

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.390 
it a lot of pushing but that grille is
moving<00:06:12.880> quite<00:06:13.120> a<00:06:13.150> bit<00:06:13.650> my<00:06:14.650> water<00:06:14.919> on<00:06:15.250> that

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
moving quite a bit my water on that

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.600 
moving quite a bit my water on that
that's<00:06:15.970> not<00:06:16.150> going<00:06:16.539> anywhere<00:06:17.020> at<00:06:17.320> all<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:17.830> so

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
that's not going anywhere at all and so

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.310 
that's not going anywhere at all and so
and<00:06:19.090> then<00:06:19.270> like<00:06:19.450> I<00:06:19.479> said<00:06:19.690> one<00:06:19.930> of<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.139> funds

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
and then like I said one of the funds

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.719 
and then like I said one of the funds
has<00:06:20.530> already<00:06:20.860> failed<00:06:21.039> along<00:06:21.340> with<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:21.520> blue

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
has already failed along with the blue

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.400 
has already failed along with the blue
LED<00:06:22.120> on<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.300> front<00:06:22.570> so<00:06:22.750> that<00:06:22.780> is<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:22.990> little<00:06:23.229> bit

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
LED on the front so that is a little bit

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.230 
LED on the front so that is a little bit
disappointing<00:06:23.590> from<00:06:24.430> up<00:06:24.700> further<00:06:24.940> and

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
disappointing from up further and

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.330 
disappointing from up further and
however<00:06:26.229> I<00:06:26.500> don't<00:06:26.740> think<00:06:26.860> that<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.160> funds

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
however I don't think that the funds

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.740 
however I don't think that the funds
that<00:06:27.639> important<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.419> what<00:06:28.539> I<00:06:28.570> was<00:06:28.720> really

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
that important and what I was really

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.510 
that important and what I was really
driving<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.680> they're<00:06:29.889> still<00:06:30.460> very<00:06:30.910> very<00:06:31.210> very

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
driving and they're still very very very

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.700 
driving and they're still very very very
cool<00:06:33.580> when<00:06:34.000> I<00:06:34.030> finished<00:06:34.450> using<00:06:34.630> them<00:06:34.840> anyway

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
cool when I finished using them anyway

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.350 
cool when I finished using them anyway
that's<00:06:35.919> pretty<00:06:36.070> much<00:06:36.430> about<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.729> that's<00:06:37.150> all

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
that's pretty much about it that's all
