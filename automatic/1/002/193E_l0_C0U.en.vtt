00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.180
 and goes again the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.430
 again a very antisocial moment 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.740

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.700
 in the small 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.860
 cover natural look and there may 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.150
 it would be nice if you ever did this 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.709
