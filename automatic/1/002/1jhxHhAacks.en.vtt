let<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.250> hear<00:02:24.280> one<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> those<00:02:24.850> sound<00:02:25.090> effects

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360

let you hear one of those sound effects
I<00:02:25.480> think<00:02:25.510> that's<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.320> best<00:02:26.530> thing

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
I think that's one of the best thing

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.040 
I think that's one of the best thing
I've<00:02:26.950> ever<00:02:27.100> seen<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.430> my<00:02:27.610> car<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.750> sound

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
I've ever seen in my car is just a sound

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.070 
I've ever seen in my car is just a sound
of<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.700> 20<00:02:30.700> different<00:02:30.910> types<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.630> squid<00:02:31.840> just

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
of like 20 different types of squid just

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.620 
of like 20 different types of squid just
going<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:33.250> smacking<00:02:33.730> their<00:02:33.880> faces<00:02:34.270> on<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
going just smacking their faces on the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.260 
going just smacking their faces on the
floor<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.470> then<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.070> love<00:02:36.280> them<00:02:36.400> die<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.850> if

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
floor and then I love them die and if

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.030 
floor and then I love them die and if
they<00:02:37.390> don't<00:02:37.630> they're<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.840> gonna<00:02:38.170> lay<00:02:38.740> their

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
they don't they're just gonna lay their

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.220 
they don't they're just gonna lay their
room<00:02:39.280> die<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.300> guess<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:40.780> quite<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.990> quick

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
room die so I guess it's quite a quick

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.600 
room die so I guess it's quite a quick
build<00:02:41.830> up<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.130> know<00:02:42.220> they're<00:02:42.370> not<00:02:42.430> gonna

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
build up you know they're not gonna

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.310 
build up you know they're not gonna
start<00:02:42.940> flying<00:02:43.240> up<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.630> sky<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:44.080> what<00:02:44.230> we

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
start flying up in the sky like what we

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.310 
start flying up in the sky like what we
saw<00:02:44.470> last<00:02:44.500> them<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.760> there<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.900> glitch

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
saw last them but there is a glitch

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.170 
saw last them but there is a glitch
which<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.980> can<00:02:48.010> see<00:02:48.160> for<00:02:48.580> every<00:02:48.970> single

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
which as you can see for every single

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.090 
which as you can see for every single
creep<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:49.870> blown<00:02:50.140> up<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.650> will<00:02:50.830> see

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
creep of that is blown up you will see

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.700 
creep of that is blown up you will see
that<00:02:51.790> they<00:02:52.060> actually<00:02:52.360> stay<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.350> sky<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
that they actually stay in the sky you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.870 
that they actually stay in the sky you
can't<00:02:54.070> hit<00:02:54.310> them<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.490> know<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:54.760> won't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
can't hit them you know they won't

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.520 
can't hit them you know they won't

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
they're not going to disappear um I'm

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.320 
they're not going to disappear um I'm
pretty<00:02:56.710> sure<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.130> if<00:02:57.690> Rosie<00:02:58.690> happens<00:02:59.500> to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
pretty sure that if Rosie happens to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.600 
pretty sure that if Rosie happens to
update<00:03:01.330> he's<00:03:01.570> mod<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.920> know<00:03:03.040> patch<00:03:03.280> this

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
update he's mod and you know patch this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.550 
update he's mod and you know patch this
then<00:03:04.030> I'm<00:03:04.450> sure<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.750> your<00:03:05.020> Minecraft<00:03:05.380> world

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
then I'm sure that your Minecraft world

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.740 
then I'm sure that your Minecraft world
is<00:03:05.800> gonna<00:03:05.980> remove<00:03:06.880> there<00:03:07.120> now<00:03:07.270> they're<00:03:07.600> not

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
is gonna remove there now they're not

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.530 
is gonna remove there now they're not
going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:08.050> there<00:03:08.260> forever<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:10.420> is

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
going to be there forever so that is

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.210 
going to be there forever so that is
essentially<00:03:10.900> all<00:03:11.230> what<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.590> mod<00:03:11.860> does<00:03:11.890> I

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
essentially all what this mod does I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.410 
essentially all what this mod does I
kind<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.430> led<00:03:12.640> astray<00:03:12.880> because<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.090> thought<00:03:13.330> it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
kind of led astray because I thought it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.090 
kind of led astray because I thought it
was<00:03:13.510> quite<00:03:13.720> funny<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:15.330> yes<00:03:16.830> sounds<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.920> them

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
was quite funny and yes sounds of them

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.199 
was quite funny and yes sounds of them
or<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.959> just<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.550> sound<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:22.090> then

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
or of that just that sound and then

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.880 
or of that just that sound and then
we've<00:03:22.300> got<00:03:22.540> some<00:03:22.600> more<00:03:23.080> ink<00:03:23.380> sex<00:03:23.709> just

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
we've got some more ink sex just
