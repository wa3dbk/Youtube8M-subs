00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
are like me and decided that you wanted

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.070 
are like me and decided that you wanted
to<00:00:16.230> go<00:00:16.680> through<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> storyline<00:00:17.750> with<00:00:18.750> caught

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to go through the storyline with caught

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.019 
to go through the storyline with caught
because<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.500> think<00:00:19.619> Dead<00:00:19.980> Rising<00:00:20.100> 3<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.609> always

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
because I think Dead Rising 3 is always

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359 
because I think Dead Rising 3 is always
better<00:00:21.720> co-op<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.500> any<00:00:22.650> Dead<00:00:22.890> Rising<00:00:23.039> game

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
better co-op or any Dead Rising game

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.370 
better co-op or any Dead Rising game
actually<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:23.939> there's<00:00:24.210> better<00:00:24.359> co-op<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
actually I think there's better co-op so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.779 
actually I think there's better co-op so
I<00:00:25.410> made<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.769> brother<00:00:25.890> decided<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.640> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
select them all and eventually it'll

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.930
