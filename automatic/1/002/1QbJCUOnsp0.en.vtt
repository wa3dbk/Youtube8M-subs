00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello to both a sad bac 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.370
 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.140
 found for episode number 18 of King 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 or all but if I just wanted 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.840
 apologize because in fact there will be 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.460
 only one episode this week 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.500
 besides it will appear Wednesday and not 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.199
 Tuesday as usual because Tuesday 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.300
 I'm not at home and I have a lot of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 a lot of things to do so here is a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.039
 only episode this week please tell me 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 excuse that's it but here's a brief truce from 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.060
 chatter so and that always the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
 Silver players are certainly not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.960
 hundreds of thousands of profits but 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.700
 well, here it is thirty times 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 one thousand and forty thousand and fifty thousand 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.800
 profits credit of profits forgiveness and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 so here I try to vary 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.350
 at the end of the episode you have a little 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.360
 little changed you know when you do 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.789
 stick to the right 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.920
 you can see what is the country 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.660
 the team and all that so I made them 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.809
 for the end of the episode so here it is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 gallo who played grenades fc in liga 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 Nigerian bbva and scorers 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 were to the Brazilian keeper of the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.520
 fiorentina 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.020
 here I recovered at 3300 straw 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.700
 in middle left while he is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.590
 basic avg of psv eindhoven on 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.210
 Dutch is here even if it's not the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 best formation of the world 4 4 1 1 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.360
 finally in any case for the frame well 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 sure I like this training 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.320
 a very complete training that 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.020
 looks a little bit like 4-2-3-1 neto 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.259
 once again finally they 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 will leave all my neto will leave all 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.880
 my neto will leave 4000 credit not 4500 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 as I have never been able to put them 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 I could have put a little more expensive 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.189
 it does not matter castaignos in a hurry and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.799
 while scorer and costs about 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.040
 3000 Credit where I said I'll 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.060
 to put 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.320
 I should have put myself at four thousand 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.939
 there are times when I say to myself 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.590
 damn but why do not you put this player to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.200
 this price there it swims the line a little bit 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.710
 dear gilles get to 2000 to 2500 I 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 finally believe alfonso here we have you 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.490
 where in b where he asked for 6000 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.689
 credit so I'm good but certainly 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 it's not the best composition of the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.310
 Here I put it at 4500 Lisandro 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 lopez in one word these voices 750 credit 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 that's a very good deal there I 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 will draw about 2000 2500 credit 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.229
 profits I believe he will sell himself 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.259
 at 4000 but I believe it is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.819
 will make four million see that in the end 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 this is neto some have asked me 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.439
 why I put in 26 hours is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.780
 because I often have laziness 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.159
 raise every time and 6 hours is 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.420
 well especially if for example for 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.310
 lisandro lopez you have seen a price 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.650
 I had started 2500 and in price 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.299
 immediate purchase I go to 4000 is 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.640
 also someone looking for a word that's 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.079
 finally lisandro lopez in a word is to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.209
 that moment and that remains for example 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.590
 three hours he's gonna he's not going to wait he 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.780
 will buy it right away it's less 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.459
 expensive even if he could see it at 2500 in 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.019
 waiting for three hours so that's it 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.390
 for that I put six hours earlier 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.049
 than an hour because already that's 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.690
 less wasted time and this is how 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.190
 after six hours I come back 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.470
 depends on when I leave and all that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.810
 I'll be back after two days and if 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.609
 it is partly I raise but here is 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.129
 its part not necessarily every time from 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.879
 first shot like age and it took me 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.799
 thrice 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.470
 I had the rossi who finally 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.030
 Parma players the right back of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.230
 parma you do not really recommend them 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.970
 for resale purchase 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.250
 it's not going so well I had it 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.629
 not really tested before so good 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.889
 he is a correct player 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.510
 here it is from now on I 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.430
 will you show where are they 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.709
 play parma in italy in series 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.030
 for also duarte very good player him 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.470
 also that I like a lot I think 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.389
 maya a little video that should 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.069
 happen on him in the months that 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.980
 come in the coming weeks 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.180
 during the months but that's what I 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.500
 intends to launch a new series but 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.480
 I'm waiting to finish at all but if for 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.040
 launch this series 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.879
 ghezzal here is lyon it was 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.500
 long time I had not done a little 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.430
 buying resale on him at Sinai too 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.579
 it's not bad because it comes 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.400
 to be transferred to Brazilian d1 so 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.139
 So it's the price in mexican d1 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.459
 goes little by little increased it's a small 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.269
 little the same phenomenon that we can have 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.849
 for mapou yanga mbiwa to newcastle for 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.760

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.980
 to a tube and gold that's it and spy 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.449
 red soumah here at 1200 it's a very 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.699
 good deal that's good 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.040
 I could have sold it much more expensive to 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.239
 it annoys me to see that I sabotaged the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.319
 frankly I could have won 2000 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.180
 credit more may not be ten 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.349
 a thousand but yeah 5000 more credit 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.540
 I really do a few things 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.549
 mistakes like fonso the same I could have 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.690
 put a little more expensive yunus there is 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.760

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.719

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.579
 take I'll try to sell them 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:24.310
 about wet credit is not bad 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.009
 santa croce parma defender who is going
