00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
website but I just forgot what I was

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.999 
website but I just forgot what I was
doing<00:01:45.229> okay<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
doing okay so now that you have that

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
doing okay so now that you have that
basically<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:53.030> paste<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:57.200> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
basically you just paste it there and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.130 
basically you just paste it there and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
see how there's a lot more free space

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.459 
see how there's a lot more free space
that's<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.500> using<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:02.159> Giga<00:02:02.490> RAM

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
that's because you're using one Giga RAM

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.839 
that's because you're using one Giga RAM
instead<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.780
