00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.729 
gives you a nice load gear for steep
climbs<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> top<00:00:57.930> gear<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.559> the

climbs but a top gear that is the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.400 
climbs but a top gear that is the
equivalent<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> 53:12<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
now now tom is going to get the gear

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
now now tom is going to get the gear

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
right by selecting it early is how to do

here now I'm not going to change gear

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
here now I'm not going to change gear
under<00:01:25.680> load<00:01:25.829> I've<00:01:26.009> selected<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.729> gear

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
under load I've selected the gear

under load I've selected the gear
already<00:01:27.149> I<00:01:27.509> could<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.320> cruise<00:01:28.590> around<00:01:28.740> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
already I could just cruise around this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.660 
already I could just cruise around this
corner<00:01:29.189> nice<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.610> easy

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670

Tom changes gear already got a bit of a
gear<00:01:35.039> crunch<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> I've<00:01:36.060> left<00:01:36.240> him<00:01:36.360> behind

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
gear crunch and I've left him behind

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.590 
gear crunch and I've left him behind
again<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:38.820> about<00:01:38.850> selecting<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> gear

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
again it's all about selecting the gear

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.710 
again it's all about selecting the gear
nice<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> early<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.789> thinking<00:01:41.789> ahead<00:01:41.880> avoid
