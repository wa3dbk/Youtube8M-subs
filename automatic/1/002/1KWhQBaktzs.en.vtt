00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.100
 Why 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.830
 for a lot in a little video on 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.239
 mechanically and bamboo 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.459
 but a passenger who was sitting next to a um if he would be fair 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.519
 I'm still happy if a road is reunited 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.130
 when we are not finished she is more than proud of my team the inhabitants took 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.560
 as a substitute on the contrary 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.680
 so the creative genius in catalonia 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 I am dug a little bit 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 here is the detail 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.560
 cut but I also believe 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 in a curve 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 they want to give some flexibility to the tip 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.430
 no prosecution 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.730
 in the room that is not ashamed 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.810
 steve jobs 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.810
 beyond the pcr 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.910
 and for good reason 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.480
 unlikely 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.530
 we have a little girl 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.940
 perugini 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.040
 the club part in recent years 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.170
 rc health change especially in the group 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.540
 so I can not help 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 except yesterday 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 the best 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 the bpa according to m 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 10 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
 herbst however I believe in all logic 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.119
 what we saw 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.929
 basso is because it's better known 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.789
 newobs com with afp 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.629
 yet I find it funny 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.629
 clegg 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.049
 because it's a criticism 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.209
 Rocancourt 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.929
 when paul bulcke 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.929
 what does upcp cost 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.059
 then I tell what she is falling apart 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.919
 for me 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.709
 it's a shark 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.459
 to finish my own 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.249
 what happened 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.969
 what I find they have committed 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.619
 I think of him 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.879
 how to believe what 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.069
 Why 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.599
 and then in London 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.319
 it's very rare 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.919
 the neck of the cruel schlucht 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.559
 or it's not because you like it 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:06.799
 the country's oil flow
