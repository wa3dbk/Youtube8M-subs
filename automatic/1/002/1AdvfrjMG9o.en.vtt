00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.200
 each other further to have place 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.210
 centimeters and there we go 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 So make 4 cuts up to the circle 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.670

 I have the fat braid strips 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.250
 we take a yellow and a red one and strips 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.480

 taped off the good sheet 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.170
 and then stick the other strip with it 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.170
 with the point 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.230
 then look once a leaf look then you see 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 that they are glued together in a corner 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.260
 is then we go this way this way 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.260
 simple exactly that there wrong 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.480
 we go red over yellow father and then 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.900
 you always remain very red over red 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.990
 very nice here and there 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.270
 then there is a mouse kick you so 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.980

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.060

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.810
 blue evening can do nothing tama 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.600
 spin it out so you need something 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.170

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.490

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.770

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.590

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.150
 out even if he so 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.400
 we also have two pieces of six 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.430
 centimeter cut to once 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.740

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.370
 legs stand but can cross pink 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.620

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.940
 with paws 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.620
 okay nice draw queer 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.070
 double-sided tape is also very attractive 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.450
 easy with no mess with glue 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:48.280
 practically just a bit of wriggling 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.160
 to get it off with the sheet 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:57.470
 not to catch a hole of course 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:59.980
 if yes each can do we think there are four 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.980
 it eight legs 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.740
 well completely glued up 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.280
 eyes are on your crotch and like the 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.250
 legs 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.770
 which is also very nice if you have one here 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.750
 makes a hole and then the world can 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:20.380
 also oh well had fun of it 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.380
