00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
view right now well I don't think the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
view right now well I don't think the
election<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.830> any<00:00:29.010> surprise<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.510> whole

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
election was any surprise but the whole

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
election was any surprise but the whole
question<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.500> people<00:00:31.859> both<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
question is that people both the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.639 
question is that people both the
Democrats<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> vote<00:00:33.840> Republicans<00:00:34.440> in

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
Democrats out and vote Republicans in

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.180 
Democrats out and vote Republicans in
for<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.670> reasons<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> skeptic

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
for the right reasons and I'm a skeptic

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
for the right reasons and I'm a skeptic
when<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.460> comes<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> governments<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
when it comes to governments because I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
when it comes to governments because I
think<00:00:39.899> government<00:00:40.559> by<00:00:41.040> its<00:00:41.190> very<00:00:41.399> nature<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
think government by its very nature is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.049 
think government by its very nature is
inherently<00:00:42.510> bad<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.710> government<00:00:44.250> has<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
inherently bad because government has a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
inherently bad because government has a
monopoly<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.530> force<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
monopoly on the use of force it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580 
monopoly on the use of force it
restrains<00:00:47.309> people<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.050> far<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.289> haven't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
restrains people so so far I haven't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.160 
restrains people so so far I haven't
seen<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.430> much<00:00:50.670> change<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.539> Republicans

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
seen that much change when Republicans

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
seen that much change when Republicans
are<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> power<00:00:52.680> even<00:00:53.520> back<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> Reagan

are in power even back in the Reagan
years<00:00:54.840> people<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:55.739> realize<00:00:56.070> he<00:00:56.340> raised

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the Chinese are coming over in droves

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.610 
the Chinese are coming over in droves
and<00:03:47.850> they're<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.510> biggest<00:03:48.630> investors<00:03:49.319> for

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
and they're the biggest investors for

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.069 
and they're the biggest investors for
example<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.220> United<00:03:50.519> States<00:03:50.760> property<00:03:51.079> so

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
example in the United States property so

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.920 
example in the United States property so
I<00:03:52.530> don't<00:03:53.130> know<00:03:53.310> when<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.269> courage<00:03:54.569> is<00:03:54.750> going

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
I don't know when the courage is going

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.930 
I don't know when the courage is going
to<00:03:54.989> collapse<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.680> dannielle<00:03:56.400> I'm<00:03:56.549> not<00:03:56.700> even

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
to collapse and dannielle I'm not even

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420 
to collapse and dannielle I'm not even
sure<00:03:57.150> what<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:58.109> means<00:03:58.470> collapse<00:03:58.980> all<00:03:59.280> right

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
sure what that means collapse all right

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.250 
sure what that means collapse all right
well<00:03:59.670> but<00:04:00.150> are<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.450> confident<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.049> will

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
well but are you confident it will

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
well but are you confident it will
collapse<00:04:01.650> well<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.190> don't<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.519> what<00:04:02.670> collapse

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
collapse well I don't know what collapse

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.970 
collapse well I don't know what collapse
means<00:04:03.269> because<00:04:03.630> it's<00:04:03.840> worth<00:04:04.109> depending<00:04:04.859> on

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
means because it's worth depending on

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.460 
means because it's worth depending on
who<00:04:05.130> you're<00:04:05.760> discussing<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.389> with<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:07.200> worth

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
who you're discussing it with it's worth

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.729 
who you're discussing it with it's worth
somewhere<00:04:07.859> between<00:04:07.920> 1%<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.180> 5%<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:10.349> what<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
somewhere between 1% and 5% of what it

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:11.960 
somewhere between 1% and 5% of what it
was<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> hundred<00:04:11.250> years<00:04:11.459> ago

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
was a hundred years ago

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.480 
was a hundred years ago
so<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:12.750> kind<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.049> like<00:04:13.230> space<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.950> time

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
so it's kind of like space and time

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.600 
so it's kind of like space and time
infinity<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.600> can<00:04:15.750> keep<00:04:15.900> dividing<00:04:16.230> $1<00:04:16.770> over

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
infinity you can keep dividing $1 over

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.820 
infinity you can keep dividing $1 over
and<00:04:17.760> over<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.180> finally<00:04:18.560> Robert<00:04:19.560> we're<00:04:19.709> almost
