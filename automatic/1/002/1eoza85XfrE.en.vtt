the crap natural box because it did

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
the crap natural box because it did

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
in digestible chunks and areas where it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
in digestible chunks and areas where it
could<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.030> easily<00:01:57.780> read<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.530> understood<00:01:59.130> by
