now<00:00:25.019> when<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.289> say<00:00:25.470> quick<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.890> easy<00:00:26.039> note<00:00:26.400> that

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
now when I say quick and easy note that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
now when I say quick and easy note that
it<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.730> still<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> take<00:00:27.480> some<00:00:27.660> time<00:00:27.869> as

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it is still going to take some time as

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
it is still going to take some time as
it<00:00:28.199> requires<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.680> lot<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> kills<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.150> about<00:00:30.359> all

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it requires a lot of kills but about all

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
it requires a lot of kills but about all
the<00:00:30.720> maps<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> we've<00:00:31.199> been<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.800> far<00:00:32.070> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the maps that we've been to so far this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160 
the maps that we've been to so far this
seems<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> easiest<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
seems to be the easiest one to do it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
seems to be the easiest one to do it
the<00:00:34.680> reason<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.040> picked<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.370> map<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.880> because

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the reason I picked this map is because

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
the reason I picked this map is because
it<00:00:36.239> has<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> Farben<00:00:37.230> spawns<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.040> I'll

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it has a lot of Farben spawns and I'll

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.729 
it has a lot of Farben spawns and I'll
show<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.790> locations<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.500> fast

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
show you the locations here we fast

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
show you the locations here we fast
traveled<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> farmhouse<00:00:41.760> though<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
traveled to the farmhouse though if you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.209 
traveled to the farmhouse though if you
go<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> entrance<00:00:43.260> there's<00:00:43.559> still<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> lot

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
go to the entrance there's still a lot

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.250 
go to the entrance there's still a lot
of<00:00:44.250> nearby<00:00:44.550> spawns<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> other<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.170> I'd

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
of nearby spawns now the other thing I'd

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
of nearby spawns now the other thing I'd
recommend<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.770> getting<00:00:46.980> an<00:00:47.129> explosive<00:00:47.789> pistol

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
recommend is getting an explosive pistol

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
recommend is getting an explosive pistol
as<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> explosive<00:00:48.899> damage<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.530> hit<00:00:49.710> multiple

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
as a explosive damage can hit multiple

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.950 
as a explosive damage can hit multiple
targets<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:51.090> easy<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.570> Barbara<00:00:51.870> it's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
targets and as easy as Barbara it's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
targets and as easy as Barbara it's
already<00:00:52.170> kill<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:53.039> shot<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.520> take<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.910> two

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
already kill one shot can take out two

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.029 
already kill one shot can take out two
or<00:00:54.239> three<00:00:54.410> another<00:00:55.410> good<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:55.829> using

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
or three another good thing about using

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
or three another good thing about using
this<00:00:56.370> map<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> arvid<00:00:57.420> kills<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.079> at

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this map with of arvid kills is that at

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
this map with of arvid kills is that at
least<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.829> us<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.609> mobs<00:00:59.820> were<00:01:00.090> quite<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> bit

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
least for us the mobs were quite a bit

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
least for us the mobs were quite a bit
lower<00:01:00.750> level<00:01:01.109> than<00:01:01.199> us<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lower level than us so all you have to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
lower level than us so all you have to
do<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> visit<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.180> barbra<00:01:03.480> spawns<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:03.989> down

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
do is visit some barbra spawns look down

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.280 
do is visit some barbra spawns look down
your<00:01:04.290> iron<00:01:04.470> sights<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> capped<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> few<00:01:05.549> birds

your iron sights and capped a few birds

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
your iron sights and capped a few birds
now<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.680> location<00:01:08.220> you'll<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:08.549> get

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

several<00:01:23.040> challenges<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.700> were<00:01:23.790> updating<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
several challenges that were updating as

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
several challenges that were updating as
I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.810> doing<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.890> makes<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> an

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I was doing this so that makes this an

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.830 
I was doing this so that makes this an
even<00:01:26.670> better<00:01:26.850> location<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.570> you'll<00:01:27.720> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
even better location as you'll be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.359 
even better location as you'll be
working<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.259> multiple<00:01:28.619> challenges<00:01:28.799> at<00:01:29.189> once

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
working on multiple challenges at once

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
working on multiple challenges at once
like<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.240> said<00:01:30.479> though<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.659> takes<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
like I said though it takes a lot of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
like I said though it takes a lot of
kills<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> later<00:01:32.189> ranks<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.700> quick<00:01:32.939> draws

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
kills see the later ranks of quick draws

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
kills see the later ranks of quick draws
but<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.140> time<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.680> this

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
but it's gonna take some time but this

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
but it's gonna take some time but this
seems<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.220> an<00:01:35.369> easy<00:01:35.579> enough<00:01:35.850> tactic<00:01:36.360> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
seems to be an easy enough tactic this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
seems to be an easy enough tactic this
is<00:01:37.110> something<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.740> recommend<00:01:37.860> working

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
is something I would recommend working

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
is something I would recommend working
on<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> solo<00:01:39.270> though<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
on it solo though as you don't want to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.569 
on it solo though as you don't want to
keep<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.650> partner<00:01:40.979> running<00:01:41.280> around<00:01:41.340> not

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
keep your partner running around not

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.789 
keep your partner running around not
doing<00:01:41.610> anything<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.780> Bluff<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> doing<00:01:43.530> here

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
doing anything as my Bluff is doing here

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
doing anything as my Bluff is doing here
now<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.399> mentioning<00:01:44.820> solo<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> enemies<00:01:45.750> are

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
now it's mentioning solo the enemies are

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.389 
now it's mentioning solo the enemies are
quite<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.229> easier<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.250> you're

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
