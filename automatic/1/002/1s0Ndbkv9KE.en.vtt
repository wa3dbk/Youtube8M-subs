00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
flow those waves and we have to watch

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
flow those waves and we have to watch
those<00:01:08.700> carefully<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.510> come<00:01:09.780> across<00:01:09.990> they

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
those carefully as they come across they

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.310 
those carefully as they come across they
can<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.590> tricky<00:01:10.979> sometimes<00:01:11.990> temperatures<00:01:12.990> are

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
can be tricky sometimes temperatures are

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.289 
can be tricky sometimes temperatures are

I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.720> used<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.080> 47<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.490> forecast

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I think we used a 47 is the forecast

midday<00:03:28.250> let's<00:03:29.250> look<00:03:29.490> at<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.910> namm<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.780> north

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
midday let's look at the namm the north

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.080 
midday let's look at the namm the north
american<00:03:31.530> mesoscale<00:03:32.130> model<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:32.730> all<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
american mesoscale model in all of a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.440 
american mesoscale model in all of a
sudden<00:03:33.420> new<00:03:33.570> it's<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:35.030> considerably<00:03:36.030> wetter

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
sudden new it's a considerably wetter

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.060 
sudden new it's a considerably wetter
this<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.930> valid<00:03:37.260> at<00:03:37.380> three<00:03:37.590> o'clock<00:03:37.650> tomorrow

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
this is valid at three o'clock tomorrow

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.060 
this is valid at three o'clock tomorrow
afternoon<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:40.050> here<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.650> with<00:03:40.950> this

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
afternoon and so here we go with this

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.980 
afternoon and so here we go with this
next<00:03:41.310> impulse<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.060> again<00:03:42.300> these<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.780> very

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
next impulse and again these can be very

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.710 
next impulse and again these can be very
tricky<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:44.610> know<00:03:44.700> by<00:03:44.880> golly<00:03:45.150> it's<00:03:45.360> cold

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
tricky and you know by golly it's cold

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.780 
tricky and you know by golly it's cold
now<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.320> suggesting<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:46.980> all<00:03:47.160> rain<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
now this is suggesting it's all rain and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.850 
now this is suggesting it's all rain and

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.830 
approach of a forecasting method it
would<00:03:56.580> suggest<00:03:56.820> if<00:03:57.210> we<00:03:57.330> see<00:03:57.540> anything

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
would suggest if we see anything

would suggest if we see anything
tomorrow<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.040> form<00:03:59.310> of
