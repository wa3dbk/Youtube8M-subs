where your locations at in the United

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.370 
where your locations at in the United
States<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.970> California<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.900> grow<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> lot

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
States in California we can grow a lot

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560 
States in California we can grow a lot
of<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.579> frost<00:00:32.969> occasionally

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
of this but we do get frost occasionally

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.970 
of this but we do get frost occasionally
too<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.230> protect<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> our

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
too so we have to protect some of our

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
too so we have to protect some of our
plant<00:00:35.610> material<00:00:36.059> such<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> blue

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
plant material such as this is a blue

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.459 
plant material such as this is a blue
ginger<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> shade<00:00:39.570> grower<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.440> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
ginger and this is a shade grower so I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.510 
ginger and this is a shade grower so I
know<00:00:40.649> I'm<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> plant<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
know I'm going to plant it on a

frost<00:00:44.840> then<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.789> Ivy<00:00:47.789> geraniums<00:00:48.300> which

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
frost then we have Ivy geraniums which

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
frost then we have Ivy geraniums which
you<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.989> over<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.379> United<00:00:49.649> States<00:00:49.710> they
