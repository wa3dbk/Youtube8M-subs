in the mob packet Wow um and it should

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.440 
in the mob packet Wow um and it should
work<00:02:42.700> sugar<00:02:43.360> crash<00:02:44.010> if<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.310> crashes<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:46.090> should

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
work sugar crash if it crashes it should

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.760 
work sugar crash if it crashes it should
just<00:02:46.900> um<00:02:47.200> when<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.840> does<00:02:49.840> logo<00:02:50.410> thing<00:02:50.650> it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
just um when it does logo thing it

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.690 
just um when it does logo thing it
changes<00:02:51.360> go<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.900> should<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:53.290> like

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
changes go it just should just like
