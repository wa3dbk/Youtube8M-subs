here<00:00:03.980> is<00:00:04.100> a<00:00:04.130> side<00:00:04.460> view<00:00:04.790> of<00:00:04.819> the<00:00:06.069> intestinal

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
here is a side view of the intestinal

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.730 
here is a side view of the intestinal
model<00:00:07.929> again<00:00:08.929> we<00:00:09.139> can<00:00:09.349> see<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.040> four<00:00:10.309> layers

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
model again we can see the four layers

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.100 
model again we can see the four layers
over<00:00:12.740> here<00:00:13.039> this<00:00:13.249> is<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.669> muscularis<00:00:14.360> mucosae

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
over here this is the muscularis mucosae

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.730 
over here this is the muscularis mucosae
which<00:00:15.640> marks<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.820> boundary<00:00:17.240> between<00:00:17.740> the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
which marks the boundary between the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.999 
which marks the boundary between the
mucosa<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:21.380> submucosa<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:23.890> right<00:00:24.890> over

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
mucosa and the submucosa and right over

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.609 
mucosa and the submucosa and right over
here<00:00:25.160> we<00:00:25.460> see<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.779> circular<00:00:27.320> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
here we see the circular and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.759 
here we see the circular and
longitudinal<00:00:28.070> layers<00:00:28.880> that<00:00:29.320> make<00:00:30.320> up<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
longitudinal layers that make up the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.450 
longitudinal layers that make up the
muscularis<00:00:31.310> externa<00:00:32.140> then<00:00:33.140> finally<00:00:33.680> here<00:00:34.280> we

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
muscularis externa then finally here we

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.889 
muscularis externa then finally here we
have<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.239> serosa<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:37.550> would<00:00:37.879> be<00:00:38.390> your

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
have the serosa this would be your

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.490 
have the serosa this would be your
visceral<00:00:39.469> peritoneum<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:41.289> would<00:00:42.289> include

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
visceral peritoneum which would include

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.020 
visceral peritoneum which would include
a<00:00:42.739> mesothelium<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:45.520> underlying<00:00:46.520> connective

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
a mesothelium and underlying connective

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.470 
a mesothelium and underlying connective
tissue<00:00:49.899> here<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> mucosa<00:00:52.300> here<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.449> a

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
tissue here is the mucosa here is a

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.160 
tissue here is the mucosa here is a
villus<00:00:53.899> looking<00:00:54.559> at<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:54.800> from<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.010> side<00:00:55.219> and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
villus looking at it from the side and

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.580 
villus looking at it from the side and
here<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.260> can<00:00:57.379> see<00:00:57.620> two<00:00:59.260> intestinal<00:01:00.260> glands

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
here you can see two intestinal glands

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.000 
here you can see two intestinal glands
this<00:01:01.309> one<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.940> actually<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.140> duct<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.590> a

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
this one is actually the duct of a

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.100 
this one is actually the duct of a
deeper<00:01:04.550> gland<00:01:04.790> which<00:01:04.970> we'll<00:01:05.150> talk<00:01:05.300> about<00:01:05.360> as

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
deeper gland which we'll talk about as

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.100 
deeper gland which we'll talk about as
part<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.619> submucosa<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:08.330> here<00:01:08.600> we<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:08.900> see

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
part of the submucosa so here we can see

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.999 
part of the submucosa so here we can see
an<00:01:09.409> intestinal<00:01:10.189> gland<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.409> if<00:01:12.409> we<00:01:12.680> look<00:01:12.860> more

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
an intestinal gland and if we look more

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.910 
an intestinal gland and if we look more
closely<00:01:13.159> at<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:13.960> we<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.170> see<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.470> same<00:01:15.619> things

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
closely at it we can see the same things

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.569 
closely at it we can see the same things
we<00:01:16.100> talked<00:01:16.310> about<00:01:16.430> earlier<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.770> simple

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
we talked about earlier the simple

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.660 
we talked about earlier the simple
columnar<00:01:19.759> epithelium<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:21.680> cells<00:01:21.950> in<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
columnar epithelium the cells in the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.899 
columnar epithelium the cells in the
gland<00:01:22.970> are<00:01:23.299> secretory<00:01:24.049> in<00:01:24.259> function<00:01:24.729> we<00:01:25.729> can

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
gland are secretory in function we can

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.910 
gland are secretory in function we can
see<00:01:26.060> some<00:01:26.329> goblet<00:01:26.780> cells<00:01:26.930> represented<00:01:27.680> here

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
see some goblet cells represented here

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.030 
see some goblet cells represented here
and<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:29.600> B<00:01:29.960> cells<00:01:30.229> over<00:01:30.439> here<00:01:30.710> which<00:01:30.890> are

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
and this B cells over here which are

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.010 
and this B cells over here which are
colored<00:01:31.399> red<00:01:31.640> with<00:01:31.880> again<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.479> Paneth<00:01:32.990> cells

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
colored red with again the Paneth cells

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.179 
colored red with again the Paneth cells
and<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.960> gray<00:01:36.320> material<00:01:36.590> with<00:01:36.920> blood

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
and this gray material with blood

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.609 
and this gray material with blood
vessels<00:01:37.329> that<00:01:38.329> surrounds<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.049> gland<00:01:39.290> would

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
vessels that surrounds the gland would

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.730 
vessels that surrounds the gland would
be<00:01:39.770> part<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.670> lamina<00:01:41.090> propria

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.000 

here<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.920> can<00:01:46.070> see<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.730> two<00:01:46.910> layers<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:48.010> the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
here you can see the two layers of the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.400 
here you can see the two layers of the
muscularis<00:01:49.930> mucosae<00:01:52.840> here's<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.930> closer<00:01:54.200> view

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
muscularis mucosae here's a closer view

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.160 
muscularis mucosae here's a closer view
of<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:55.520> submucosa<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:57.440> submucosa<00:01:58.010> is<00:01:59.170> part

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
of the submucosa this submucosa is part

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.090 
of the submucosa this submucosa is part
of<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.680> duodenum<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:03.230> reason<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:03.950> know

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
of the duodenum and the reason we know

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.550 
of the duodenum and the reason we know
that<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.580> because<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.780> duodenum<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.380> where

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
that is because the duodenum is where

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.210 
that is because the duodenum is where
you<00:02:06.680> find<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:08.290> submucosal<00:02:09.290> gland<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
you find this submucosal gland in the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.180 
you find this submucosal gland in the
submucosa<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.500> submucosal

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
submucosa so this is the submucosal

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.900 
submucosa so this is the submucosal
gland<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.840> would<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.580> emptying<00:02:16.580> its

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
gland and it would be emptying its

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.050 
gland and it would be emptying its
secretions<00:02:17.450> by<00:02:18.110> way<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.560> duct<00:02:18.890> into<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
secretions by way of this duct into the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.240 
secretions by way of this duct into the
lumen<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.870> duodenum<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> look<00:02:25.040> at

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
lumen of the duodenum this is a look at

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.420 
lumen of the duodenum this is a look at
the<00:02:25.580> muscularis<00:02:26.090> externa<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.950> would<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the muscularis externa this would be the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.120 
the muscularis externa this would be the
circular<00:02:28.790> layer<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
circular layer and this is the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.790 
circular layer and this is the
longitudinal<00:02:31.730> ey're<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.230> see<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
longitudinal ey're and you can see the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.160 
longitudinal ey're and you can see the
yellow<00:02:33.980> represents<00:02:34.280> again<00:02:34.970> nerves<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.870> my

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
yellow represents again nerves of the my

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
yellow represents again nerves of the my
enteric<00:02:36.530> plexus<00:02:38.020> here<00:02:39.020> now<00:02:39.230> we<00:02:39.290> have<00:02:39.770> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
enteric plexus here now we have the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.800 
enteric plexus here now we have the
serosa<00:02:41.410> which<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.680> also<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.810> visceral

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
serosa which is also the visceral

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.110 
serosa which is also the visceral
peritoneum<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.530> has<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:49.250> mesothelium

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
peritoneum and it has a mesothelium

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.170 
peritoneum and it has a mesothelium
which<00:02:50.540> consists<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.910> simple<00:02:52.910> squamous

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
which consists of a simple squamous

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.050 
which consists of a simple squamous
epithelium<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:56.060> these<00:02:56.420> cells<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:57.019> flat<00:02:58.060> and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
epithelium so these cells are flat and
