00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
welcome to amateur gardener for advice

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.079 
welcome to amateur gardener for advice
and<00:00:02.760> growing<00:00:03.000> your<00:00:03.179> own<00:00:03.210> food<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.929> flowers<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
and growing your own food and flowers a

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.509 
and growing your own food and flowers a
sweet<00:00:06.089> pea<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.359> like<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.049> have<00:00:07.230> deep<00:00:07.560> roots<00:00:07.830> so

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
sweet pea is like to have deep roots so

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.560 
sweet pea is like to have deep roots so
I<00:00:08.849> use<00:00:09.150> these<00:00:09.870> compostable<00:00:10.410> pots<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.820> in

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
I use these compostable pots and in

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110 
I use these compostable pots and in
order<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.960> make<00:00:13.110> them<00:00:13.290> stand<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:14.120> better

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
order to make them stand up better

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.150 
order to make them stand up better
because<00:00:15.450> they<00:00:15.599> aren't<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:15.900> flexible<00:00:16.470> plus

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
because they aren't by flexible plus

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.340 
because they aren't by flexible plus
there's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> hole<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> bottom<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.359> put<00:00:19.199> them

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
there's a hole in the bottom I put them

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.089 
there's a hole in the bottom I put them
into<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.039> seed<00:00:20.279> tray<00:00:21.680> like<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:25.980> also

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
into the seed tray like so you can also

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
into the seed tray like so you can also
do<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> same<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.630> runner<00:00:27.840> beans

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
do the same with the runner beans

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.870 
do the same with the runner beans
because<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:30.980> get<00:00:31.980> their<00:00:32.579> roots

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
because they like to get their roots

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.049 
because they like to get their roots
down<00:00:33.149> quite<00:00:33.450> long<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.820> fill<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.969> up

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
down quite long and then fill them up

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.959 
down quite long and then fill them up
with<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.570> compost<00:00:46.100> I'm<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.430> seed<00:00:48.420> sowing

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
with some compost I'm using seed sowing

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.900 
with some compost I'm using seed sowing
compost<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:52.829> off<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:53.850> start

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
compost to get them off to a good start

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:06.969 
compost to get them off to a good start
so<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:57.780> seed<00:00:58.020> has<00:00:58.350> been<00:00:58.879> soaking<00:00:59.879> overnight

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.890 

here<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> sweet<00:01:08.369> pea<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> 24<00:01:09.299> hours<00:01:09.659> after

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
here the sweet pea is 24 hours after

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
here the sweet pea is 24 hours after
being<00:01:10.500> left<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> water<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.790> doing<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
being left in the water and doing that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
being left in the water and doing that
it<00:01:13.439> swells<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> seed<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.830> makes

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it swells the seed up so that it makes

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.999 
it swells the seed up so that it makes
it<00:01:17.189> easier<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.689> shoots<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.290> come

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it easier for the little shoots to come

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.850 
it easier for the little shoots to come
through<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.490> hard<00:01:21.210> exterior<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.830> seed

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
through the hard exterior of the seed

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.690 
through the hard exterior of the seed
and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.000> seed<00:01:27.439> per<00:01:28.439> pot

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.870 

and<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:34.850> variety<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:35.390> painted<00:01:35.900> lady<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.790> you

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
and this variety is painted lady and you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.030 
and this variety is painted lady and you
can<00:01:38.030> saw<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:38.480> between<00:01:40.420> now<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:42.340> May<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
can saw this between now and May and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.500 
can saw this between now and May and
then<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.250> will<00:01:46.400> fly<00:01:46.640> over<00:01:46.670> two<00:01:46.940> feet<00:01:47.060> between

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
then it will fly over two feet between

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:56.470 
then it will fly over two feet between
May<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.780> October<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.430> after<00:01:56.300> you've<00:01:56.450> done

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
May and October so after you've done

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.770 
May and October so after you've done
that<00:01:56.660> then<00:02:00.610> put<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> little<00:02:01.970> bit<00:02:02.120> more<00:02:02.180> soil<00:02:02.540> on

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
that then put a little bit more soil on

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.560 
that then put a little bit more soil on
top<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:04.120> that's<00:02:05.120> it

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
top and that's it

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.800 
top and that's it
either<00:02:06.290> keep<00:02:06.470> these<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.860> greenhouse<00:02:07.370> on

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
either keep these in the greenhouse on

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.850 
either keep these in the greenhouse on
the<00:02:08.810> windowsill<00:02:10.450> or<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> cold<00:02:12.650> frame

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the windowsill or in the cold frame

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.220 
the windowsill or in the cold frame
don't<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:15.980> surprised<00:02:16.310> if<00:02:16.340> they<00:02:16.670> take<00:02:17.230> longer

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
don't be surprised if they take longer

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.370 
don't be surprised if they take longer
to<00:02:18.700> germinate<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.940> normal<00:02:20.390> because<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.080> is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
to germinate the normal because it is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.580 
to germinate the normal because it is
the<00:02:21.650> winter<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.540> show<00:02:26.750> these<00:02:26.990> in<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the winter if you show these in the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.080 
the winter if you show these in the
spring<00:02:27.920> they'd<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.430> within<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.060> few<00:02:29.270> weeks

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
