 bet of minecraft then i'm here in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.230
 a mod vanilla let's say in a manner of speaking 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.510
 because it is not really a vanilla fashion it is 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.910
 a vain map of koman block cones 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.759
 very particular created by mcm chi 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 stand would be skateboarding in minecraft 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.039
 guys and here gives us youtube buttons 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.199
 twitter and networks to go see a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 net they are as it is made behind here I have 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 I put up signs with tricks because 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.910
 practically water is made with the former 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.040
 four practice slots 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.809
 of the inventory these below and go 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.520
 made tip combination then the most 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.440
 easy 1234 weigh 2 3 4 1 3 4 2 1 and 4 2 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.809
 3 1 so however put here so that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 then see skateboard in part bull nick 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 clot because you can also go to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 take the components are the pipe lo 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.530
 small ramp and the rail and that the arts of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.820
 all your things as we say 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.379
 one of your names is called a difficulty thing 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.699
 maybe you don't like the difficulty of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.760
 this thing because now you have become 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 Brasini become oppi do not know and then 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.900
 you can create everything you want 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.729
 like this your ramp then the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.310
 you can make as long as you want 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.689
 you can make small ramps so for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.549
 make smaller jumps and then 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.909
 you can create all your own 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.890
 want 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.590
 then here there are greetings to do 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 christian 96 of gamer it acli tone 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.570
 claiton philadelphia win two doc 382 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.540
 galileo lucky 007 and samo che 12 hi a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 all kids ok then let's see some 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.600
 how it works we have these 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.640
 skateboarder in here that would be 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.460
 these here how do you get active with 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.229
 the couple here we click with the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 right we will end up over will change 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.439
 also our skin and will become one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.659
 kind of tony hawk then this 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.430
 let's say in the pre-created map then the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 problem of this fashion that is difficult 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.299
 to show you are the skills 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 because many could not see them 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.430
 for example backflip if it is with 12 34 of the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.560
 problem that I have to stay active in this 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 way 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.510
 so in what sense 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.770
 I should jump and do the skill then 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.600
 you may also be that not 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 You'll never see why 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.300
 first if you have to stay in this 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.510
 position as you see yours 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.920
 skill even if I do it you will see 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.770
 just the little stars in practice 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.709
 you will probably be able to see why 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.140
 averagely so and make the wheels to the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.110
 flight but I will certainly not succeed 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.459
 I will succeed for what reason why I have to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.870
 to fly 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.420
 so I have to do it at the right time and 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.390
 I have to go like this 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.220
 I understood I had some stars 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.360
 if I also hear the sound and problem that 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.209
 you didn't see her well because she did 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.830
 the skateboard backflip then 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.260
 things he can show him well in 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.150
 this time I'm the strip from above 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.590
 these beautiful rails 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.060
 so we can do these streaks 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.950
 then promised things then you should 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 jump or do life skills 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.760
 of experience every couple do 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.200
 an ability well done and variously there 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.489
 they are also others that are these 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.500
 three that in practice would be the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.320
 hook a left to crooked one 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.030
 right and a central only that it is not 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.260
 easy to do it in fact I think there 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.940
 I only show this left 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.350
 if it comes out to me that's a little where it already has 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.209
 misery in the hull I miss that anymore 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.209
 left with it is not possible to do him 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.860
 ok from the ball 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.190
 no because I was not well central when 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.470
 I requested the command su 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.360
 here it is look I'm doing a 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.340
 boys evolution than the right one 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.360
 I should now do the other one that is 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.000
 the left one has done it now and now 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.549
 we miss the last one that is difficult 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.739
 same no I did it I did it straight 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.680
 straight up I did it here 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.920
 no it doesn't make me see it pay a fa 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.570
 see if I do so look I'm in 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.730
 head down from the other side with all e 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.079
 two legs fantastic 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.209
 you can then do these very large 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.010
 combinations that make your effects 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.799
 you can do your tracks you can do 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.510
 the four tricks if you succeed or with the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.660
 keypad or the first two you can do it 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.040
 even with the wheel only is a 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.209
 let's say 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.530
 a very simple map but a lot 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.540
 particular because it allows us anyway 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.319
 to use a skateboard to do 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.730
 skills 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.159
 let's look at the installation of 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.739
 reston says take the skateboard first 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.739
 because I take it I write first 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.770
 ok taken the skateboard we go 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.699
 ok i'm in the red son what facility 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.080
 fool what is it here I have tried but I have 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.910
 hurt then that's all 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.979
 the remaining plant is used 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.750
 look at them to create those effects 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.820
 marry that weird 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.330
 above there is a basket below 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.090
 something you can get into who's inside 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.919
 because I see type of ramps set 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.610
 there maybe to activate the watch stuff 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.039
 cool 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.509
 ie not really a fantastic map 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.160
 with keyboard and look at how many with 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.759
 block it had to use anyway do it 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.520
 work 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.229
 there is another two lines this floor 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.690
 made chessboards of their own style for 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.520
 making the plants is compliments e 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.320
 very stylish the guy is fine 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.389
 you guys saw today's map e 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.949
 skateboarding in minecraft i hope vi 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.210
 both liked to try to work out of 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.860
 headlights clique in your own way 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.900
 play with your PC maybe not 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.240
 glycemic pilate server and below if 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.400
 hashtag useful or useless even though I think 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.800
 there are no specific rituals or if 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.199
 hashtag I like it because it's a nice mod 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.820
 we say beautiful vanilla command happened 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.750
 guys give as if it was only 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.409
