little bit right but you know it does

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.609 
little bit right but you know it does

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
much of the i think it's the Archangel

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.250 
much of the i think it's the Archangel
because<00:03:49.760> even<00:03:50.150> though<00:03:50.239> my<00:03:50.359> hair<00:03:50.540> look<00:03:50.690> nice<00:03:50.870> it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
because even though my hair look nice it

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.860 
because even though my hair look nice it
did<00:03:51.440> not<00:03:51.730> volumize<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.760> mean<00:03:53.329> it<00:03:53.540> didn't<00:03:53.810> get

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
did not volumize I mean it didn't get

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.449 
did not volumize I mean it didn't get
bigger<00:03:55.420> but<00:03:56.420> my<00:03:56.600> hair<00:03:56.900> felt<00:03:57.380> like<00:03:58.160> there<00:03:58.340> was

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
bigger but my hair felt like there was

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.660

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
gel in there it wasn't crunchy it just

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.120 
gel in there it wasn't crunchy it just
felt<00:04:02.060> kind<00:04:02.239> of<00:04:02.660> like<00:04:05.139> gluey<00:04:06.139> I<00:04:06.560> can't<00:04:06.859> even<00:04:06.920> get
