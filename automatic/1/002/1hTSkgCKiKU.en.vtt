00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.360 
yesterday there now below 1706 that was
that<00:02:50.050> pivot<00:02:50.379> point<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.709> said<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:51.010> want<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.220> keep

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
that pivot point I said you want to keep

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.770 
that pivot point I said you want to keep
it<00:02:51.550> below<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.950> my<00:02:53.950> sentiment<00:02:54.940> at<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.480> point

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
it below but my sentiment at this point

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.589 
it below but my sentiment at this point
is<00:02:55.959> we<00:02:56.200> are<00:02:56.319> probably<00:02:56.709> beginning<00:02:57.459> way<00:02:57.819> five<00:02:58.239> on

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
is we are probably beginning way five on

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.350 
is we are probably beginning way five on
this<00:02:59.019> count<00:02:59.319> here<00:02:59.560> I've<00:02:59.680> got<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.160> long<00:03:00.700> wave

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
this count here I've got this long wave

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.770 
this count here I've got this long wave
one<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.620> belief<00:03:03.130> right<00:03:03.430> now<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.630> it

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
one and my belief right now is that it

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.460 
one and my belief right now is that it
is<00:03:05.019> more<00:03:05.470> likely<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:07.630> was<00:03:08.230> our

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
is more likely that this was our

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.100 
is more likely that this was our
conclusion<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.340> wave<00:03:09.910> one<00:03:10.239> back<00:03:10.569> right<00:03:10.930> in

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
conclusion of wave one back right in

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.339 
conclusion of wave one back right in
this<00:03:11.650> area<00:03:11.709> here<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:13.239> have<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.720> very<00:03:13.959> very

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
this area here we have this very very

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.589 
this area here we have this very very
small<00:03:14.769> retracement<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:15.910> even<00:03:16.120> put<00:03:16.360> that

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
small retracement we can even put that

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.100 
small retracement we can even put that
here<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:19.540> we<00:03:19.900> had<00:03:20.200> our<00:03:20.560> wave<00:03:21.340> three<00:03:22.120> that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
here and then we had our wave three that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.970 
here and then we had our wave three that
propelled<00:03:23.650> us<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:24.459> recent<00:03:26.640> 1763<00:03:27.810> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
propelled us to this recent 1763 and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.130 
propelled us to this recent 1763 and
then<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.370> last<00:03:30.700> correction<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.540> $20

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
then this last correction this $20

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.259 
then this last correction this $20
correction<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:33.099> going<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.610> be<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.060> let<00:03:34.239> me

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
correction is going to be for let me

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.069 
correction is going to be for let me

enter that this long i should say two
day<00:03:38.760> correction<00:03:39.760> would<00:03:39.910> take<00:03:40.120> us<00:03:40.269> into<00:03:40.450> four

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
day correction would take us into four

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.620 
day correction would take us into four
and<00:03:40.989> now<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.010> minor<00:03:42.579> sub<00:03:43.060> count<00:03:43.329> minor

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630

other words the wave count below the
intermedia<00:04:01.000> count<00:04:01.299> now<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.810> question<00:04:02.739> we

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
intermedia count now the question we

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.110 
intermedia count now the question we
then<00:04:03.340> want<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.269> know<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.870> how<00:04:05.620> can<00:04:06.250> we<00:04:06.549> do<00:04:06.819> some

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
then want to know is how can we do some

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.259 
then want to know is how can we do some
sort<00:04:07.389> of<00:04:07.510> forward<00:04:08.459> forecasting<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.609> my

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
sort of forward forecasting and my

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.830 
sort of forward forecasting and my
anticipation<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.650> realized<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.400> wave<00:04:13.090> 3

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
anticipation is realized that wave 3

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.569 
anticipation is realized that wave 3
cannot<00:04:14.350> be<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.680> shortest<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.280> certainly

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
cannot be the shortest it certainly

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.069 
cannot be the shortest it certainly
doesn't<00:04:15.850> need<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.239> be<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.510> longest<00:04:16.690> and

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
doesn't need to be the longest and

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.020 
doesn't need to be the longest and
therefore<00:04:17.769> I've<00:04:17.979> really<00:04:18.489> got<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.669> see<00:04:18.880> where

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
therefore I've really got to see where

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.170 
therefore I've really got to see where
I'm<00:04:19.120> putting<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.570> one<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.049> two<00:04:20.260> but<00:04:21.180> my

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
I'm putting this one and two but my

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.390 
I'm putting this one and two but my
sentiment<00:04:22.900> right<00:04:23.139> now<00:04:23.380> in<00:04:23.680> terms<00:04:23.919> of<00:04:24.130> where<00:04:24.370> I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
sentiment right now in terms of where I

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.640 
sentiment right now in terms of where I
think<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.880> Margaret<00:04:25.300> could<00:04:25.510> go<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:26.050> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
think this Margaret could go is the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.969 
think this Margaret could go is the
first<00:04:27.010> point<00:04:27.580> we<00:04:27.940> really<00:04:28.330> need<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:29.620> this

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
first point we really need to see this

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.180 
first point we really need to see this
market<00:04:30.460> trade<00:04:30.760> beyond<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:32.289> break<00:04:32.590> above

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
market trade beyond is to break above

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.420 
market trade beyond is to break above
first<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.300> all<00:04:36.510> 1763<00:04:37.889> we've<00:04:38.889> got<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.250> break

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
first of all 1763 we've got to break

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.490 
first of all 1763 we've got to break
above<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.910> that's<00:04:40.210> our<00:04:40.389> first<00:04:40.630> target<00:04:41.020> area

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
above that that's our first target area

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.460 
above that that's our first target area
and<00:04:41.740> we<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.729> see<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.090> we've<00:04:43.210> gotten<00:04:43.690> some

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
and we can see that we've gotten some

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.310 
and we can see that we've gotten some
areas<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.400> resistance<00:04:45.970> there<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.330> course<00:04:46.780> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
areas of resistance there of course the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.490 
areas of resistance there of course the
next<00:04:47.800> target<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.340> going<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.760> be<00:04:48.880> 1802<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
next target is going to be 1802 and the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.810 
next target is going to be 1802 and the
1802

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
1802

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.560 
1802
is<00:04:52.210> really<00:04:52.810> based<00:04:53.050> upon<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:54.520> recent<00:04:55.360> top

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
is really based upon this recent top

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.570 
is really based upon this recent top
that<00:04:55.810> we<00:04:55.960> had<00:04:56.170> this<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.620> back<00:04:56.860> october

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
that we had this is back october

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.160 
that we had this is back october
november<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.180> last<00:04:58.300> year<00:04:58.780> that's<00:04:58.930> the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
november of last year that's the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.070 
november of last year that's the
secondary<00:04:59.740> top<00:05:00.010> after<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.180> market<00:05:01.540> hit<00:05:01.840> a

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
secondary top after the market hit a

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.010 
secondary top after the market hit a
high<00:05:02.320> of<00:05:02.350> 19<00:05:03.010> 20<00:05:03.370> came<00:05:03.550> down<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:03.970> then<00:05:04.120> came<00:05:04.780> on

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
high of 19 20 came down and then came on

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.440 
high of 19 20 came down and then came on
the<00:05:05.440> secondary<00:05:05.920> top<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:06.730> these<00:05:06.910> are<00:05:06.970> going<00:05:07.330> to

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
the secondary top so these are going to

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.470 
the secondary top so these are going to
be<00:05:07.540> our<00:05:07.750> target<00:05:08.020> points<00:05:08.590> here<00:05:08.920> if<00:05:09.100> we<00:05:09.970> have<00:05:10.180> a

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
be our target points here if we have a

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.900 
be our target points here if we have a
way<00:05:10.810> five<00:05:11.110> that's<00:05:11.440> equal<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.800> wave<00:05:12.100> one<00:05:12.400> you're

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
way five that's equal to wave one you're

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.580 
way five that's equal to wave one you're
looking<00:05:12.940> at<00:05:13.390> about<00:05:13.620> 1850<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:15.220> would<00:05:15.790> end

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
looking at about 1850 that would end

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.740 
looking at about 1850 that would end
just<00:05:17.590> this<00:05:17.830> wave<00:05:18.130> number<00:05:18.580> one<00:05:18.850> we<00:05:19.390> would<00:05:19.540> go

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
just this wave number one we would go

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.750 
just this wave number one we would go
into<00:05:19.930> at<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.500> point<00:05:20.860> some<00:05:21.250> sort<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.640> a

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
into at that point some sort of a

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.550 
into at that point some sort of a
correction<00:05:22.240> because<00:05:22.360> it's<00:05:22.750> an<00:05:22.900> intermediate

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
the sub count here and then we would go

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
we have not yet taken that out once i

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.300 
we have not yet taken that out once i
should<00:06:10.210> say<00:06:10.480> and<00:06:10.720> i<00:06:10.990> should<00:06:11.350> say<00:06:11.530> if<00:06:11.770> but<00:06:12.070> my

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
more likely to say once we take that out

our<00:06:14.830> next<00:06:15.550> real<00:06:15.790> target<00:06:16.470> is<00:06:17.470> going<00:06:17.830> to<00:06:17.920> be

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
our next real target is going to be

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.600 
our next real target is going to be
based<00:06:18.370> upon<00:06:18.610> these<00:06:19.600> sets<00:06:19.960> of<00:06:20.110> highs<00:06:20.320> here<00:06:20.800> just

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
based upon these sets of highs here just

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.230 
based upon these sets of highs here just
below<00:06:21.820> thirty-six<00:06:22.600> dollars<00:06:26.340> 37-39<00:06:27.340> and<00:06:27.880> i

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
below thirty-six dollars 37-39 and i

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.760 
below thirty-six dollars 37-39 and i
think<00:06:28.540> that's<00:06:28.720> enough<00:06:28.990> targets<00:06:29.440> to<00:06:29.650> the

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
think that's enough targets to the

think that's enough targets to the
upside<00:06:30.130> for<00:06:30.370> now<00:06:30.550> we've<00:06:31.300> got<00:06:31.570> a<00:06:31.840> really<00:06:32.350> strong
