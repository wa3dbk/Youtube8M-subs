00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
transition we're seeing in games with

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.510 
transition we're seeing in games with
full<00:01:48.080> performance<00:01:48.229> capture<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.009> bring<00:01:49.190> titles

like beyond black ops 2 in the last of

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.290 
like beyond black ops 2 in the last of
us<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.349> life<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.860> think<00:01:52.610> it's<00:01:52.729> great<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.940> think<00:01:53.060> it

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
us to life I think it's great I think it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.699 
us to life I think it's great I think it
gives<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> actors<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> chance<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.560> really

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
gives the actors a chance to really

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.770 
gives the actors a chance to really
embody<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.340> characters<00:01:55.849> so<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.149> really

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
embody the characters so that I really

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.760
