00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.540
 video of here I'll show you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.700
 location of parts for us 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.830
 build the shield well the first piece 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.780
 stay there and follow the path of the backup 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 is on top of cart and where you have the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.690
 stone of the year five 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.090
 Let's make a way that goes by. 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.470
 fall if it is not there what you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 have to do is follow this path that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 I 'm going there and picking up the right and up 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.199
 he in the area where the giant steps and comes back 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.760
 to make a video more forward 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 showing all the places where the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.070
 giant steps on it goes there too 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.719
 Miami to pick you up if she does not 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 there is the last place that she can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.460
 being is also there on the right 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.710
 When you go straight there, picking up 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 right is going to have another cart with a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.719
 dead body on him also on 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 you take this piece now over the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 second part I'll show you guys I 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 I'm without one of her places, right? 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.190
 I do not know if there are any good places. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.780
 should be in the skirt of there even I really 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 I do not know why whenever you play always 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 Paul , how can you see this? 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 person there is another exploring well there must 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.949
 have some place in that area but I 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.780
 I do not know if you know how to let us 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.330
 ikea comments battling please 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.010
 and the guys there and also for us to go there 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.040
 find the other possibilities 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 of that part well now the last 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.720
 in which the middle piece is there 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.390
 near the led number is around the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310
 head on websites as if they can see there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.490
 the first place you're showing 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.439
 You are the one in front of the ones ending in the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.100
 area specific proof of the genre reader 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.650
 five 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.729
 There it is right there that is where I was. 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.619
 only you do the same path that goes 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.479
 find then you have to give 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.420
 come back through the church to get you 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.180
 find the class the other two 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 possibilities of this piece is a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.780
 of them is thus to determine the path that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 following her will it be right there 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.229
 underneath that dead body that I am 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.960
 showing you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.310
 where I just did not take the barista and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.200
 last piece is close to us 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.939
 length and 40 in front right 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.860
 one of the places we buy from 40 is 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.229
 ali there was the first time I saw 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 this family piece but then we can 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.530
 build anywhere even if 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.950
 have a craft table 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.629
 but I'd rather build it, that's where 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.590
 if they can see by playing close because it is 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.360
 a place that runs 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.770
 I 'm going to bring a video like I said 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.810
 before the places I go 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.730
 the campaign otherwise you come to where high 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.170
 But how can you see the listening there? 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.270
 tell us the will, do not forget 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 comment if you know the other 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.600
 two possibilities of that part that 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.920
 I said I had one because I 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.080
 I really can not find the fights. 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.130
 but then people and that's why it 's just 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.130
 It's good and until the next
