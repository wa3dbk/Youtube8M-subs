address<00:00:09.830> management<00:00:10.340> using<00:00:11.000> iPad<00:00:11.510> and<00:00:11.780> the

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
address management using iPad and the

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.330 
address management using iPad and the
first<00:00:12.380> thing<00:00:12.530> I'm<00:00:12.620> gonna<00:00:12.770> actually<00:00:12.860> look<00:00:13.130> at

first thing I'm gonna actually look at
in<00:00:13.460> this<00:00:13.639> is<00:00:13.820> an<00:00:13.940> external<00:00:14.390> script<00:00:15.140> so<00:00:15.680> this<00:00:15.769> is

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
in this is an external script so this is

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.350 
in this is an external script so this is
available<00:00:16.040> on<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.460> Microsoft<00:00:16.970> Gallery

integration with DHCP so this way

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.150 
integration with DHCP so this way
actually<00:00:22.640> do<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.150> paulien<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.050> DHCP<00:00:24.800> actual

releases<00:00:25.789> into<00:00:26.449> my<00:00:26.539> iPad<00:00:26.810> database<00:00:28.000> now<00:00:29.000> I'm

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
releases into my iPad database now I'm

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.750 
releases into my iPad database now I'm
actually<00:00:29.480> just<00:00:29.720> gonna<00:00:29.900> run<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:30.350> manually<00:00:31.039> so

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
actually just gonna run this manually so

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.790 
actually just gonna run this manually so
the<00:00:31.850> first<00:00:32.090> thing<00:00:32.269> we<00:00:32.390> do<00:00:32.570> is<00:00:32.870> we<00:00:33.320> run<00:00:33.559> the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
the first thing we do is we run the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.640 
the first thing we do is we run the
script<00:00:34.269> she's<00:00:35.269> now<00:00:35.420> gonna<00:00:35.629> enable<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.590> new

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
script she's now gonna enable this new

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.229 
script she's now gonna enable this new
kemal<00:00:37.580> it<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:38.690> can<00:00:38.839> now<00:00:38.930> say<00:00:38.989> invoke<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:40.239> Pam

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
kemal it so I can now say invoke I Pam

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.130 
kemal it so I can now say invoke I Pam
DHCP<00:00:42.170> lease<00:00:42.409> my<00:00:43.159> ipam<00:00:43.640> server<00:00:44.030> name<00:00:44.330> is<00:00:44.570> this

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
DHCP lease my ipam server name is this

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.160 
DHCP lease my ipam server name is this
server<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:45.790> then<00:00:46.790> I'm<00:00:46.879> gonna<00:00:47.030> pull<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.600> from

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
server and then I'm gonna pull it from

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.579 
server and then I'm gonna pull it from
one<00:00:48.769> of<00:00:48.890> my<00:00:49.100> DHCP<00:00:49.729> servers<00:00:50.150> this<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.290> gonna<00:00:51.379> go

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
one of my DHCP servers this is gonna go

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.759 
one of my DHCP servers this is gonna go
and<00:00:51.710> communicate<00:00:52.339> with<00:00:52.519> that<00:00:52.729> DHCP<00:00:53.330> server

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
and communicate with that DHCP server

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.200 
and communicate with that DHCP server
pulling<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.890> information<00:00:55.010> about<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.850> Scopes

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
pulling the information about the Scopes

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.299 
pulling the information about the Scopes
and<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:56.989> actually<00:00:57.320> pull<00:00:57.680> in<00:00:57.860> the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
and then actually pull in the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.090 
and then actually pull in the
information<00:00:59.000> so<00:00:59.720> it<00:00:59.809> found<00:00:59.989> an<00:01:00.110> ipv6<00:01:00.589> which<00:01:00.979> is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
information so it found an ipv6 which is

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.310 
information so it found an ipv6 which is
fine<00:01:01.309> I<00:01:01.339> don't<00:01:01.489> have<00:01:01.729> any<00:01:01.850> configured<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.199> if<00:01:03.260> I

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
fine I don't have any configured so if I

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.950 
fine I don't have any configured so if I
now<00:01:03.440> go<00:01:03.470> back<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.830> my<00:01:04.010> database<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.940> I<00:01:05.360> refresh

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
now go back to my database and I refresh

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.710 
now go back to my database and I refresh
we<00:01:06.650> can<00:01:06.680> now<00:01:07.100> see<00:01:07.490> suddenly<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.090> have<00:01:08.299> all<00:01:08.450> this

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
we can now see suddenly I have all this

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.010 
we can now see suddenly I have all this
information<00:01:09.010> about<00:01:10.010> my<00:01:10.159> leases<00:01:10.579> as<00:01:10.729> well<00:01:11.020> now

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
information about my leases as well now

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.440 
information about my leases as well now
I<00:01:12.079> only<00:01:12.409> ran<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:12.950> as<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.549> one-off<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.329> this

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
I only ran this as a one-off so this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.260 
I only ran this as a one-off so this
he's<00:01:14.539> gonna<00:01:14.630> get<00:01:14.840> stale<00:01:15.229> very<00:01:15.649> quickly<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.090> one

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
he's gonna get stale very quickly so one

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.179 
he's gonna get stale very quickly so one
of<00:01:17.359> the<00:01:17.420> things<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:17.869> could<00:01:18.020> actually<00:01:18.200> do<00:01:18.829> is

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
of the things you could actually do is

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.880 
of the things you could actually do is
create<00:01:19.969> a<00:01:20.000> scheduled<00:01:20.570> pass<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.200> do<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.560> for

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
create a scheduled pass to do this for

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.740 
create a scheduled pass to do this for
me<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:22.549> is<00:01:22.609> actually<00:01:23.000> built<00:01:23.299> into<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
me and this is actually built into the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.840 
me and this is actually built into the
command<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.560> if<00:01:24.649> I<00:01:24.740> add<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:25.310> command<00:01:25.670> I

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
command so if I add to the command I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.050 
command so if I add to the command I
just<00:01:26.090> typed<00:01:26.390> in<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.140> periodic<00:01:27.950> what<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.820> now

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
just typed in the periodic what is now

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.270 
just typed in the periodic what is now
doing<00:01:29.450> is<00:01:29.570> creating<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.229> scheduled<00:01:30.979> task

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
doing is creating a scheduled task

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.340 
doing is creating a scheduled task
that's<00:01:32.000> gonna<00:01:32.149> go<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.479> trigger<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:32.960> for<00:01:33.229> me

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
that's gonna go and trigger this for me

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.410 
that's gonna go and trigger this for me
so<00:01:33.740> I'm<00:01:33.890> not<00:01:34.250> necessarily<00:01:34.369> advising<00:01:35.090> use<00:01:35.270> this

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
so I'm not necessarily advising use this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.779 
so I'm not necessarily advising use this
credential<00:01:35.780> but<00:01:36.380> just<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.829> example<00:01:37.219> it's

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
credential but just in this example it's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.029 
credential but just in this example it's
now<00:01:37.939> gone<00:01:38.119> ahead<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.630> created<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.439> scheduled

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
now gone ahead and created a scheduled

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.310 
now gone ahead and created a scheduled
task<00:01:40.310> if<00:01:40.820> I<00:01:40.880> fire<00:01:41.119> up<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.359> task<00:01:41.600> scheduler<00:01:42.140> I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
task if I fire up the task scheduler I

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.709 
task if I fire up the task scheduler I
can<00:01:42.799> now<00:01:42.920> see<00:01:43.130> it's<00:01:43.249> there<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.240> effectively<00:01:44.630> at

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
can now see it's there so effectively at

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.200 
can now see it's there so effectively at
the<00:01:44.810> same<00:01:45.079> time<00:01:45.439> every<00:01:46.039> day<00:01:46.249> is<00:01:46.549> gonna<00:01:46.909> go<00:01:47.060> and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the same time every day is gonna go and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.090 
the same time every day is gonna go and
trigger<00:01:47.539> this<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:47.899> it's<00:01:48.079> gonna<00:01:48.170> be<00:01:48.560> updated

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
trigger this so it's gonna be updated

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.819 
trigger this so it's gonna be updated
every<00:01:49.340> 24<00:01:50.149> hours<00:01:50.179> now<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:50.990> could<00:01:51.170> change<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.619> I

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
every 24 hours now I could change that I

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.919 
every 24 hours now I could change that I
could<00:01:52.310> change<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.700> trigger<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.240> whatever<00:01:53.509> I

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
could change this trigger to whatever I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.499 
could change this trigger to whatever I
want<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.619> best<00:01:54.859> meets<00:01:55.130> my<00:01:55.310> requirements

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
want the best meets my requirements

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.209 
want the best meets my requirements
that's<00:01:56.509> one<00:01:56.810> way<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.229> get<00:01:57.499> that<00:01:57.560> updated

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
that's one way now to get that updated

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.969 
that's one way now to get that updated

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
available so a very very powerful

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.830 
available so a very very powerful
feature<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:32.000> help<00:03:32.120> me<00:03:32.239> manage<00:03:32.450> all<00:03:32.690> of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.629 
feature here to help me manage all of
this<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.380> discovered<00:03:33.980> information<00:03:34.489> from

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
this so I discovered information from

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.879 
this so I discovered information from
DHCP<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.510> could<00:03:35.989> find<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.319> now<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.470> can<00:03:36.650> go<00:03:36.769> ahead

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
DHCP I could find it now I can go ahead

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.030 
DHCP I could find it now I can go ahead
and<00:03:37.160> actually<00:03:37.250> create<00:03:37.760> leases<00:03:38.660> and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
and actually create leases and

reservations<00:03:40.040> directly<00:03:40.790> within<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.480> tool<00:03:41.750> so

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
reservations directly within the tool so

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.599 
reservations directly within the tool so
it's<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.739> just<00:03:42.799> about<00:03:43.040> gathering

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
it's not just about gathering

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.330 
it's not just about gathering
information<00:03:44.359> from<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.470> server's<00:03:45.889> I<00:03:46.069> can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
information from the server's I can

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.559 
information from the server's I can
actually<00:03:46.609> use<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.000> go<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.239> actually<00:03:47.329> do

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
actually use it to go and actually do

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.170 
actually use it to go and actually do
full<00:03:47.930> configurations<00:03:48.919> so<00:03:49.849> you'll<00:03:49.970> see<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
full configurations so you'll see the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.839 
full configurations so you'll see the
date<00:03:50.329> so<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.569> can<00:03:50.720> type<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:51.109> no<00:03:51.829> ms1<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:52.760> I'll

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
date so I can type in no ms1 so I'll

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.240 
date so I can type in no ms1 so I'll
actually<00:03:52.940> make<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.269> consistent<00:03:53.569> no<00:03:54.049> ms1<00:03:54.590> so

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
actually make that consistent no ms1 so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.650 
actually make that consistent no ms1 so
this<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.430> gonna<00:03:55.519> go<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.880> communicate<00:03:56.060> with

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
this is gonna go and communicate with

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.259 
this is gonna go and communicate with
that<00:03:56.840> DHCP<00:03:57.470> server<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.639> now<00:03:58.819> see<00:03:58.849> that

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
that DHCP server and I now see that

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.020 
that DHCP server and I now see that
address<00:03:59.750> reservation<00:04:00.709> available<00:04:01.639> within<00:04:01.880> my

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030
