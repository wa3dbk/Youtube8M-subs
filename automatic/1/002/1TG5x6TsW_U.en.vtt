 reflection on truth as fundamental human need 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.820
 with some observations about the media in the context 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.970

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.790

 true means and processes of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.420
 in the process of peacebuilding in which the processes of 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 disarmament demobilization and reintegration 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 that are advancing in Colombia 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.050
 diverse actors converge with cavities and origins 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.930
 different projects 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.060
 even anta colics 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.380
 which is not strange that worries him but on the contrary 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 diversity enriches social and political processes 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.249
 when it manifests itself as the winner in democracy 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.479
 and with respect to the constitution and the law 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:18.329
 these processes are not advanced in platonic and skeptical scenarios 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.419
 but in the context of a complex reality 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.310
 where contributions and product misgivings accumulate 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 in which history has been woven 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.259
 in this country 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.209
 in our processes located in political components 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.429
 with partisan interests 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.429
 economic components with particular interests 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.180
 they move forward in the middle of an armed conflict that remains 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.059
 despite the efforts of society and the state 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.679
 and is affected by current 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:52.359
 economic processes we made them regional and global 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.249
 The perspectives 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.769
 personalities are as diverse as the diverse origin of the armed groups 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.839
 and reintegration will continue with more skepticism 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.979
 what hope on the part of the communities and groups of victims 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.319
 without whose active participation 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.359
 it is not possible to reach a good port 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.349
 inside the court the collectives of victims mobilized powers 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.249
 there are differences of perception 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.359
 of form and motivation 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.150
 and not to mention the organizations that the business 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.979
 the academic or the international cooperation entities 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.689
 intervene in these processes 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.509
 However, this diversity of actors and interests 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.489
 makes it impossible to face 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.049
 the challenge if solidarity work is not encouraged 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.219
 interdisciplinary 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.529
 despite the difficulties towards reintegration 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.930
 the objective of it is not manifesto is not pacman 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.029
 built 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:56.259
 and lose our individuality 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.469
 if it will not be done and grow 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.279
 with the neighbor with the urban peasant citizen 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.190
 despite the differences 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.420
 generating common denominators 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.449
 as Colombians and Colombians that we are 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:13.499
 integral and functional part of this actor project 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:15.589
 intergenerational 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:21.269
 that aspires to build the worthy and just and prosperous free society of the 21st century 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.060
 when it is achieved, the difference is made based on agreements 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.430
 minimum on fundamental issues 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.979
 and identify common interests 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.020
 in the same way starting from agreement on fundamental issues we become 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.610
 a collective of the very used despite coming 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.819
 from different groups journalists
