00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
printers hate CMYK printing why well

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.890 
printers hate CMYK printing why well
because<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.580> usually<00:00:20.910> comes<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.480> crack

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900

and<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.839> always<00:00:31.080> due<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> separation

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
and it's always due to the separation

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
simple as that and even though you're

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.440 
simple as that and even though you're
only<00:00:34.500> working<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.160> four<00:00:35.430> colors<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:36.330> a

only working with four colors there's a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.510 
only working with four colors there's a
lot<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.440> wrong<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.190> lot<00:00:38.370> of

lot that can go wrong there's a lot of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.450 
lot that can go wrong there's a lot of
variables<00:00:39.060> so<00:00:39.240> CMYK<00:00:40.200> separations<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.280> not

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
variables so CMYK separations are not

variables so CMYK separations are not
necessarily<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> easiest<00:00:42.540> thing<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.900> do<00:00:43.110> well

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
necessarily the easiest thing to do well

just resolve them not only did we

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.410 
just resolve them not only did we
include<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.950> most<00:00:53.220> accurate<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
generate CMYK true process EPS but we've

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
generate CMYK true process EPS but we've
also<00:00:57.810> included<00:00:58.170> methods<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.860> will<00:00:59.040> allow

you to add a custom spot color through
your<00:01:02.070> CMYK<00:01:02.550> separation<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.390> needed

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
your CMYK separation if needed

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.780 
your CMYK separation if needed
and<00:01:03.840> also<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> method<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> help<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.460> spot

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and also a method to help that spot

color<00:01:06.119> gel<00:01:06.630> better<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.679> your<00:01:07.979> CMYK

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
color gel better with your CMYK

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.209 
color gel better with your CMYK
separation<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.229> more<00:01:10.439> natural<00:01:10.500> when

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.429 
is due to two reasons number one there's
the<00:01:50.759> massive<00:01:51.240> adjustments<00:01:51.780> made<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.200> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the massive adjustments made to this so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.109 
the massive adjustments made to this so
it<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:52.920> prints<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.579> press<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.060> the

original looked on screen okay that's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.699

there are no CMYK composite channels

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.859 
there are no CMYK composite channels
okay<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.189> gone<00:02:02.429> when<00:02:03.179> you<00:02:03.329> convert<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.670 
channels into a multi-channel image you
lose<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> color<00:02:09.899> integrity<00:02:10.530> at

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
lose some of the color integrity at

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.590 
lose some of the color integrity at
least<00:02:10.860> how<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.190> appears<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.700> screen<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.450> it's

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
least how it appears on screen so it's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.360 
least how it appears on screen so it's
going<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:12.960> a<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.170> light<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.160> is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
going to look a little light but this is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.020 
going to look a little light but this is
normal<00:02:14.580> okay

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
normal okay

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.190

you<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.690> trust

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.020 

and<00:02:19.200> you'll<00:02:19.500> also<00:02:19.680> notice<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.190> we<00:02:20.340> magically

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and you'll also notice that we magically

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.570 
and you'll also notice that we magically
retain<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.660> RGB<00:02:22.319> channels<00:02:22.770> okay<00:02:23.069> now<00:02:23.459> these

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
retain the RGB channels okay now these

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.180 
retain the RGB channels okay now these
are<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.000> come<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.360> handy<00:02:24.720> when<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.410> add<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
are going to come in handy when we add a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.390 
are going to come in handy when we add a
custom<00:02:26.910> spot<00:02:27.150> color<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.990> our<00:02:28.020> CMYK<00:02:28.709> separation

if<00:02:29.550> one<00:02:30.120> happens<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.720> needed<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.470> let's<00:02:31.620> say

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
if one happens to be needed so let's say

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.830 
if one happens to be needed so let's say
if<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> big<00:02:32.310> area<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.570> bright<00:02:33.810> red

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
if you have a big area of bright red

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900 
if you have a big area of bright red
like<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.800> maybe<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.459> want<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> add

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
like we do in this maybe you want to add

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.120 
like we do in this maybe you want to add
a<00:02:36.150> spot<00:02:36.810> red<00:02:37.050> channel<00:02:37.470> although<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:37.950> would

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
a spot red channel although this would

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.830 
a spot red channel although this would
print<00:02:38.370> okay<00:02:38.700> without<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.570> know<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.720> your

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
print okay without it you know if your

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.330 
print okay without it you know if your
customer<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.260> very<00:02:40.290> particular<00:02:40.740> maybe<00:02:41.160> we

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
customer is very particular maybe we

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.160 
customer is very particular maybe we
would<00:02:41.459> want<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.730> put<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> spot<00:02:42.270> red<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.690> there

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.540 

now<00:02:46.170> let's<00:02:46.380> add<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.590> custom<00:02:46.980> spot<00:02:47.280> color

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
now let's add a custom spot color

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.820 
now let's add a custom spot color
channel<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.180> CMYK<00:02:48.690> separation<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.620> this

case<00:02:50.040> we're<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> add<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> red

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
case we're going to add the red

that custom spot color channel has been
generated<00:03:07.760> now<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:09.000> turn<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.390> our<00:03:09.540> other

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.840 
channels and then our new CMYK spot
Channel<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:17.070> let's<00:03:17.220> move<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.519> above<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.000 
Channel and let's move it above the
black<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.390> you'll<00:03:18.930> see<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.350> really<00:03:19.590> edit

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
black and you'll see that it really edit

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.170 
black and you'll see that it really edit
pop<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.730> red

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
pop to that red

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.449 
pop to that red
however<00:03:21.630> there's<00:03:22.079> probably<00:03:22.590> too<00:03:22.890> much<00:03:23.130> pop

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
however there's probably too much pop

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.970 
however there's probably too much pop
and<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.360> needs<00:03:24.630> an<00:03:24.840> adjustment<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.950> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and it needs an adjustment this is a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.490 
and it needs an adjustment this is a
problem<00:03:26.549> when<00:03:26.880> adding<00:03:27.299> spot<00:03:27.840> channels<00:03:28.320> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
problem when adding spot channels to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.280 
problem when adding spot channels to
CMYK<00:03:29.070> separations<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.420> spot<00:03:30.720> channels<00:03:31.140> are

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
CMYK separations the spot channels are

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.949 
CMYK separations the spot channels are
very<00:03:31.709> very<00:03:32.579> harsh<00:03:32.940> they<00:03:33.239> kind<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.570> take<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
very very harsh they kind of take on a

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.440 
very very harsh they kind of take on a
life<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.620> themselves<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.850> not<00:03:36.060> really

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
life to themselves and it's not really

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.360 
life to themselves and it's not really
the<00:03:36.570> spot<00:03:36.870> color<00:03:37.170> channel<00:03:37.590> itself<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.190> needs

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the spot color channel itself that needs

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.580 
the spot color channel itself that needs
to<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.610> adjusted<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.780> process<00:03:40.079> color

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
to be adjusted it's the process color

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.890 
to be adjusted it's the process color
separation<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.820> we've<00:03:42.090> got<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.329> solution<00:03:42.720> for

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
separation so we've got a solution for

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.990 
separation so we've got a solution for
that<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.410> that's<00:03:43.890> called<00:03:44.190> remove<00:03:44.519> spot<00:03:44.760> color

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
that and that's called remove spot color

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.280 
that and that's called remove spot color
data<00:03:45.209> from<00:03:45.510> CMY<00:03:46.079> let's<00:03:46.590> click<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:51.049> ok<00:03:52.049> once

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
data from CMY let's click that ok once

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650 
data from CMY let's click that ok once
this<00:03:52.470> process<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.070> complete<00:03:53.459> now<00:03:54.209> we<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:54.630> a

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
this process is complete now we have a

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.289 
this process is complete now we have a
CMYK<00:03:55.170> separation<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.549> custom<00:03:57.030> spot

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
CMYK separation with that custom spot

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.600 
CMYK separation with that custom spot
channel<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.900> looks<00:03:58.260> natural<00:03:58.620> now<00:03:59.400> if<00:03:59.489> we

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
channel that looks natural now if we

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.759 
channel that looks natural now if we
turn<00:03:59.880> off<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.239> custom<00:04:00.600> spot<00:04:00.870> channel<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.650> can

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
turn off the custom spot channel you can

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.620 
turn off the custom spot channel you can
see<00:04:02.010> there's<00:04:02.310> really<00:04:02.489> not<00:04:02.700> much<00:04:02.940> data<00:04:03.299> there

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
see there's really not much data there

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.960 
see there's really not much data there
with<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> process<00:04:04.799> color<00:04:05.010> separation<00:04:05.549> itself

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
with the process color separation itself

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.840 
with the process color separation itself
okay<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.260> you're<00:04:07.470> basically<00:04:08.070> relying<00:04:08.430> on<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
okay so you're basically relying on the

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.090 
okay so you're basically relying on the
spot<00:04:09.180> colors<00:04:09.540> China<00:04:09.840> channel<00:04:10.590> not<00:04:10.739> too<00:04:10.920> much

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
spot colors China channel not too much

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.250 
spot colors China channel not too much
not<00:04:11.370> too<00:04:11.430> little<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.090> too<00:04:12.540> much<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.109> not

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
not too little and not too much and not

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.630 
not too little and not too much and not
too<00:04:13.320> little<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.920> process<00:04:14.310> colors

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
too little of the process colors

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.039 
too little of the process colors
underneath<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.600> make<00:04:15.630> this<00:04:15.989> a

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
underneath to make this a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.680 
underneath to make this a
natural-looking<00:04:16.859> separation<00:04:17.729> now<00:04:18.180> let's<00:04:18.359> go

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
natural-looking separation now let's go

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.960 
natural-looking separation now let's go
back<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.229> original<00:04:19.350> prior<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.640> ultra
