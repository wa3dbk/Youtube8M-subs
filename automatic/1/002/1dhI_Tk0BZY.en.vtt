engineer 775 here wanting to talk about
water<00:00:09.219> storage<00:00:09.790> not<00:00:10.330> just<00:00:10.570> short-term<00:00:10.870> but

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
water storage not just short-term but

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.230 
water storage not just short-term but
long-term<00:00:11.200> water<00:00:11.889> storage<00:00:12.309> and<00:00:12.549> today<00:00:13.120> I'm

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
long-term water storage and today I'm

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.859 
long-term water storage and today I'm
using<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.809> Aqua<00:00:14.170> Mira<00:00:14.410> two<00:00:14.799> ounce<00:00:15.869> aqueous

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
using the Aqua Mira two ounce aqueous

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.929 
using the Aqua Mira two ounce aqueous
solution<00:00:17.349> it's<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.560> two-part<00:00:18.040> Part<00:00:18.340> A<00:00:18.490> Part<00:00:18.790> B

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
solution it's a two-part Part A Part B

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.349 
solution it's a two-part Part A Part B
and<00:00:19.330> you<00:00:20.020> basically<00:00:20.259> mix<00:00:20.800> those<00:00:21.100> two<00:00:21.519> and<00:00:21.820> then

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
and you basically mix those two and then

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.650 
and you basically mix those two and then
treat<00:00:22.660> treat<00:00:23.199> your<00:00:23.500> container<00:00:24.400> and<00:00:24.699> what<00:00:25.539> I'm

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
treat treat your container and what I'm

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.029 
treat treat your container and what I'm
going<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:25.869> be<00:00:25.930> treating<00:00:26.170> today<00:00:26.289> these<00:00:26.529> two<00:00:26.590> two

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
going to be treating today these two two

going to be treating today these two two
ounce<00:00:27.250> bottles<00:00:27.730> treat<00:00:28.000> sixty<00:00:28.420> gallons<00:00:28.929> and<00:00:29.529> so

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
ounce bottles treat sixty gallons and so

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.009 
ounce bottles treat sixty gallons and so
I'm<00:00:29.859> you<00:00:29.980> treating<00:00:30.250> a<00:00:30.279> 55-gallon<00:00:30.759> drum<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
I'm you treating a 55-gallon drum and

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.840 
I'm you treating a 55-gallon drum and
I'm<00:00:32.439> also<00:00:32.619> going<00:00:32.830> to<00:00:32.920> treat<00:00:33.160> this<00:00:33.340> five<00:00:33.550> gallon

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
I'm also going to treat this five gallon

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.139 
I'm also going to treat this five gallon
this<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.839> a<00:00:34.870> scepter<00:00:35.580> military<00:00:36.580> jerry<00:00:36.879> can

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
this is a scepter military jerry can

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.319 
this is a scepter military jerry can
water<00:00:37.989> container<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.430> be<00:00:39.610> used<00:00:39.820> for<00:00:40.059> fuel

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
water container it can be used for fuel

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.180 
water container it can be used for fuel
while<00:00:41.140> they<00:00:41.260> distinguish<00:00:41.770> them<00:00:41.920> from<00:00:41.950> the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
while they distinguish them from the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.650 
while they distinguish them from the
fuel<00:00:42.430> because<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.789> fuel<00:00:43.000> have<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.390> three

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
fuel because the fuel have the three

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.779 
fuel because the fuel have the three
handles<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.530> two<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.039> then<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.250> vent<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.670> the

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
handles the two and then the vent in the

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.590 
handles the two and then the vent in the
center<00:00:46.090> and<00:00:46.660> so<00:00:47.079> this<00:00:47.350> is<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:49.480> we're

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
center and so this is a one that we're

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.900 
center and so this is a one that we're
going<00:00:49.719> to<00:00:49.780> treat<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:51.399> for<00:00:51.699> long-term

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
going to treat with for long-term

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.150 
going to treat with for long-term
storage<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.140> case<00:00:53.320> I<00:00:53.620> want<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:53.920> throw<00:00:54.070> it

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
storage just in case I want to throw it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.860 
storage just in case I want to throw it

term water storage the goal here is to
have<00:01:24.280> water<00:01:24.610> treated<00:01:24.940> for<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.209> long<00:01:25.450> time<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.990> put

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
have water treated for a long time I put

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.290 
have water treated for a long time I put
on<00:01:26.649> my<00:01:26.770> little<00:01:28.890> treated<00:01:29.890> date<00:01:30.099> and<00:01:30.459> best<00:01:30.970> used

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
on my little treated date and best used

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.880 
on my little treated date and best used
by<00:01:31.539> date<00:01:31.869> from<00:01:32.140> this<00:01:32.380> little<00:01:32.530> sticker<00:01:32.860> that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
by date from this little sticker that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.120 
by date from this little sticker that
comes<00:01:33.160> with<00:01:33.340> aqua<00:01:33.580> Mira<00:01:33.899> it's<00:01:34.899> five<00:01:35.229> years<00:01:35.560> so

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
comes with aqua Mira it's five years so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.089 
comes with aqua Mira it's five years so
the<00:01:36.250> treatment<00:01:36.759> that<00:01:37.000> they<00:01:37.780> guarantee<00:01:38.319> from

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
the treatment that they guarantee from

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.210 
the treatment that they guarantee from
aqua<00:01:39.429> Mira<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.940> five<00:01:40.869> years<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.470> what<00:01:41.830> this<00:01:42.009> is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
aqua Mira is five years and what this is

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.630 
aqua Mira is five years and what this is
doing<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.819> basically<00:01:43.119> creating<00:01:43.869> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
doing is basically creating a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.639 
doing is basically creating a
environment<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.880> oxygen<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.440> high

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
environment that oxygen in the high

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.620 
environment that oxygen in the high
oxygen<00:01:48.039> environment<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.789> will<00:01:48.970> basically

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
oxygen environment that will basically

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.930 
oxygen environment that will basically
kill<00:01:50.229> all<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.590> bacteria<00:01:50.739> in<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.459> water<00:01:51.670> and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
kill all the bacteria in the water and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.109 
kill all the bacteria in the water and
keep<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.720> really<00:01:53.319> good<00:01:53.560> condition<00:01:53.739> for<00:01:54.280> up

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
keep it in really good condition for up

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.300 
keep it in really good condition for up
to<00:01:55.360> five<00:01:55.599> years<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.229> that's<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.860> dates<00:01:57.069> that<00:01:57.250> I

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
to five years so that's the dates that I

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.540 
to five years so that's the dates that I
picked<00:01:57.640> today<00:01:57.849> and<00:01:58.720> we're<00:01:59.229> going<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.410> mix<00:02:00.369> it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
picked today and we're going to mix it

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.650 
picked today and we're going to mix it
up<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.819> first<00:02:00.970> thing<00:02:01.179> you<00:02:01.239> want<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.420> do<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.599> you

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
solution Part A Part B and then we also

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.710 
solution Part A Part B and then we also
treated<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.870> 20<00:04:08.870> liter<00:04:09.080> or<00:04:09.170> five-gallon

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
treated the 20 liter or five-gallon

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.110 
treated the 20 liter or five-gallon
military<00:04:11.720> can<00:04:12.380> order<00:04:13.010> can<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.730> they<00:04:13.970> also

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
military can order can and they also

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.490 
military can order can and they also
come<00:04:14.390> in<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.540> two<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.840> half<00:04:15.220> gallon<00:04:16.220> as<00:04:16.340> well

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
come in a two and a half gallon as well

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.650 
come in a two and a half gallon as well
sucking<00:04:18.500> on<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.680> treat<00:04:18.979> if<00:04:19.790> that<00:04:20.000> one's<00:04:20.510> too

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
sucking on a treat if that one's too

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.110 
sucking on a treat if that one's too
heavy<00:04:20.870> then<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.859> can<00:04:22.010> treat<00:04:22.250> smaller<00:04:22.880> one

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
heavy then you can treat smaller one

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.490 
heavy then you can treat smaller one
half<00:04:23.330> size<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.790> other<00:04:25.970> thing<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.510> might

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
half size so the other thing is might

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.780 
half size so the other thing is might
need<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.860> get<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.070> water<00:04:28.250> out<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.490> these

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
need to get the water out of these
