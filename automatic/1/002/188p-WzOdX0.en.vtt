them into the boiling water they should
go<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.039> bottom<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.640> then<00:00:28.849> rise<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
go to the bottom and then rise to the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.340 
go to the bottom and then rise to the
top<00:00:30.050> again<00:00:31.059> hopefully<00:00:32.059> I<00:00:32.089> can<00:00:32.239> fit<00:00:32.660> most<00:00:32.989> of

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
top again hopefully I can fit most of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.600 
top again hopefully I can fit most of
these<00:00:33.500> into<00:00:34.339> this<00:00:34.550> pot<00:00:38.920> here<00:00:39.920> from<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.400> water

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
these into this pot here from the water

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.660 
these into this pot here from the water
it<00:00:40.940> is<00:00:40.970> hot<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:45.129> let<00:00:46.129> them<00:00:46.369> simmer<00:00:47.440> for<00:00:48.440> about

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
it is hot I let them simmer for about

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.299 
it is hot I let them simmer for about
5-6<00:00:49.670> minutes<00:00:50.330> and<00:00:50.869> then<00:00:51.589> try<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:51.890> very

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
5-6 minutes and then try to very

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.990 
5-6 minutes and then try to very
carefully<00:00:53.150> turn<00:00:54.080> them<00:00:54.350> around<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.820> other

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
carefully turn them around so the other

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000 
carefully turn them around so the other
side<00:00:56.420> gets<00:00:56.869> overcooked<00:00:57.909> and<00:00:58.960> then<00:00:59.979> for<00:01:00.979> a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
side gets overcooked and then for a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.719 
side gets overcooked and then for a
total<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.670> about<00:01:02.799> ten<00:01:03.799> eleven<00:01:04.220> minutes<00:01:04.400> of

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
total of about ten eleven minutes of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.710 
total of about ten eleven minutes of
cooking<00:01:05.000> time<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:07.610> should<00:01:07.970> do<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.420> and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
cooking time and that should do it and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.770 
cooking time and that should do it and
then<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.170> gently<00:01:09.520> ladle<00:01:10.520> them<00:01:10.670> out<00:01:14.049> looks<00:01:15.049> good

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
then I gently ladle them out looks good

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.690 
then I gently ladle them out looks good
floating<00:01:20.380> them<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.649> a<00:01:21.679> little<00:01:22.039> rolling<00:01:22.490> boil

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
floating them to a little rolling boil

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.319 
floating them to a little rolling boil
again<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.450> then<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:24.670> keep<00:01:25.670> watching<00:01:25.729> them

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
again and then just keep watching them

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.730 
again and then just keep watching them
and<00:01:26.659> hope<00:01:27.670> all<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.729> them<00:01:29.030> survive<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.170> not<00:01:30.469> too

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
and hope all of them survive and not too

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
of dough made approximately 40 pierogies

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.080 
of dough made approximately 40 pierogies
Gary<00:01:45.079> thinks<00:01:45.439> that's<00:01:45.619> too<00:01:46.069> many<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:46.640> they

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
Gary thinks that's too many but they

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.950 
Gary thinks that's too many but they
look<00:01:47.299> good<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.630> me

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
look good to me

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.870

I<00:01:47.990> didn't<00:01:48.799> mentioned<00:01:49.189> I<00:01:49.280> forget<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.729> mention

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
I didn't mentioned I forget to mention

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.629 
I didn't mentioned I forget to mention
before<00:01:50.179> that<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:51.079> always<00:01:51.409> try<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.889> chuck<00:01:52.369> them

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
before that I always try to chuck them

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:55.599 
before that I always try to chuck them
one<00:01:53.090> more<00:01:53.359> time<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.139> make<00:01:54.920> sure<00:01:54.950> they're

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
one more time and make sure they're

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.870 
one more time and make sure they're
nicely<00:01:56.179> pinched<00:01:56.780> closed<00:01:57.549> because<00:01:58.549> we<00:01:58.700> don't

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
nicely pinched closed because we don't

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.120 
nicely pinched closed because we don't
want<00:01:59.090> too<00:01:59.539> many<00:01:59.689> of<00:01:59.899> these<00:02:00.020> things<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:00.710> break

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
want too many of these things to break

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.489 
want too many of these things to break
it's<00:02:01.490> too<00:02:02.090> much<00:02:02.270> work<00:02:02.509> involved<00:02:02.840> making<00:02:03.350> these

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
it's too much work involved making these

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.039 
it's too much work involved making these
things<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:04.789> give<00:02:05.090> them<00:02:05.270> an<00:02:05.420> extra<00:02:05.780> little

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
things so I give them an extra little

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.800 
things so I give them an extra little
pinch<00:02:07.030> for<00:02:08.030> good<00:02:08.209> luck

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.869 

I<00:02:13.430> changed<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.110> salted<00:02:16.110> water<00:02:16.640> after<00:02:17.640> about

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
I changed the salted water after about

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.660 
I changed the salted water after about
three<00:02:18.780> or<00:02:18.810> four<00:02:19.260> batches<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:20.069> pierogies

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
three or four batches of pierogies

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.910 
three or four batches of pierogies
because<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.569> water<00:02:21.780> does<00:02:22.140> start<00:02:22.500> looking

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
because the water does start looking

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.589 
because the water does start looking
very<00:02:23.159> cloudy<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:25.069> Flowery<00:02:26.069> pasty<00:02:26.940> looking<00:02:27.329> so

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
very cloudy and Flowery pasty looking so

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.309 
very cloudy and Flowery pasty looking so
change<00:02:28.470> your<00:02:28.560> water<00:02:29.750> when<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> starts<00:02:31.140> looking

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
change your water when it starts looking

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:47.440 
change your water when it starts looking
that<00:02:31.650> way<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.829> they<00:02:34.829> should<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:37.129> good

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.309

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
okay and that's all there is to it to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.520 
okay and that's all there is to it to
really<00:02:52.209> cooking<00:02:53.209> them<00:02:53.569> later<00:02:54.110> on<00:02:54.319> I'll<00:02:54.500> show

carefully<00:03:07.069> label<00:03:07.730> them<00:03:07.880> out<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:08.720> put

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
carefully label them out and then put

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.110 
carefully label them out and then put
them<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.590> cookie<00:03:09.950> sheet<00:03:10.250> that's<00:03:10.910> lined

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
them on this cookie sheet that's lined

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.320 
them on this cookie sheet that's lined
with<00:03:11.840> wax<00:03:12.709> paper<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.550> sprayed<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> little

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
with wax paper and I sprayed a little

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.550 
with wax paper and I sprayed a little
bit<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.600> Pam<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.340> wax<00:03:16.580> paper<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.560> they

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
bit of Pam on the wax paper so they

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.729 
bit of Pam on the wax paper so they
don't<00:03:18.800> stick<00:03:19.340> hopefully<00:03:20.090> all<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.330> these

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
don't stick hopefully all of these

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:29.140 
don't stick hopefully all of these
survived<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:25.850> do<00:03:26.360> see<00:03:26.959> one<00:03:27.819> broken<00:03:28.819> one

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
survived I do see one broken one

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.520 
survived I do see one broken one
floating<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> bottom<00:03:30.350> there<00:03:30.590> but<00:03:31.549> we'll

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
floating on the bottom there but we'll

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.340 
floating on the bottom there but we'll
snack<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:33.920> one<00:03:34.160> later<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:38.170> spread<00:03:39.170> them

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
snack on that one later and spread them

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.000 
snack on that one later and spread them
out<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:41.110> then<00:03:43.930> once<00:03:44.930> they're<00:03:45.230> cooled<00:03:45.769> a

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
out and then once they're cooled a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
out and then once they're cooled a
little<00:03:46.040> bit<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.940> brush<00:03:47.780> them<00:03:48.549> with<00:03:49.549> some<00:03:49.610> melted

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
little bit I brush them with some melted

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.030 
little bit I brush them with some melted
butter<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.690> I've<00:03:50.870> got<00:03:51.080> waiting<00:03:51.319> here<00:03:51.709> on<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
butter that I've got waiting here on the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.599 
butter that I've got waiting here on the
stove<00:03:54.040> okay<00:03:55.040> here's<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.400> broken<00:03:55.700> one<00:03:57.609> didn't

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
stove okay here's a broken one didn't

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.949 
stove okay here's a broken one didn't
survive<00:03:59.260> good<00:04:00.260> Gary

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.030 

so<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.769> think<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.310> put<00:04:08.519> 19<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.629> mean<00:04:09.959> 20<00:04:10.409> rather<00:04:10.680> in

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
so I think I put 19 I mean 20 rather in

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.349 
so I think I put 19 I mean 20 rather in
this<00:04:11.370> pot<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:14.180> looks<00:04:15.180> like<00:04:15.390> 19<00:04:15.900> survived

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
this pot and looks like 19 survived

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:34.070 
this pot and looks like 19 survived
pretty<00:04:18.359> good<00:04:18.630> odds<00:04:18.870> here<00:04:19.289> huh<00:04:22.850> okay

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.520 

okay<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.889> think<00:04:35.370> these<00:04:35.520> have<00:04:36.530> cooled

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
okay I think these have cooled

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.110 
okay I think these have cooled
sufficiently<00:04:37.830> enough<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:38.789> I'm<00:04:38.879> going<00:04:39.060> to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
sufficiently enough so I'm going to

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.909 
sufficiently enough so I'm going to
quickly<00:04:39.360> dab<00:04:39.960> them<00:04:40.289> with<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.530> little<00:04:40.740> bit<00:04:40.889> of

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
quickly dab them with a little bit of

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.820 
quickly dab them with a little bit of
melted<00:04:41.430> butter<00:04:42.650> not<00:04:43.650> too<00:04:43.860> much<00:04:44.129> because<00:04:45.830> we're

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
melted butter not too much because we're

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.580 
melted butter not too much because we're
gonna<00:04:46.949> be<00:04:47.159> eating<00:04:47.460> them<00:04:48.330> with<00:04:48.750> lots<00:04:49.229> of<00:04:49.379> butter

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
gonna be eating them with lots of butter

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.240 
gonna be eating them with lots of butter
on<00:04:49.680> top<00:04:50.009> later<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:50.699> some<00:04:51.500> cholesterol<00:04:52.500> really

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
on top later on some cholesterol really

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.719 
on top later on some cholesterol really
go<00:04:53.580> sky<00:04:54.000> high<00:04:54.030> around<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:55.220> Christmas<00:04:56.220> holiday

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
go sky high around the Christmas holiday

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.180 
go sky high around the Christmas holiday
season<00:04:58.099> but<00:04:59.509> you<00:05:00.509> do<00:05:00.690> need<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.080> butter<00:05:01.289> you<00:05:02.009> do

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
season but you do need the butter you do

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.899 
season but you do need the butter you do
need<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.580> butter

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
need the butter

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.570 
need the butter
okay<00:05:03.870> there<00:05:04.319> look<00:05:04.470> good<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.039> now<00:05:05.220> I'm<00:05:05.280> going<00:05:05.520> to

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
okay there look good so now I'm going to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.480 
okay there look good so now I'm going to
transfer<00:05:05.879> them<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:10.069> containers<00:05:11.069> that<00:05:11.310> will

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
transfer them to containers that will

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.550 
transfer them to containers that will
freeze<00:05:11.819> them<00:05:12.030> until<00:05:12.180> we're<00:05:12.569> ready<00:05:12.659> to<00:05:12.810> serve

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
freeze them until we're ready to serve

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.309 
freeze them until we're ready to serve
them<00:05:16.099> okay<00:05:17.099> now<00:05:17.280> I<00:05:17.330> buttered<00:05:18.330> them<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.990> on<00:05:19.289> a

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
them okay now I buttered them and on a

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.170 
them okay now I buttered them and on a
cookie<00:05:19.710> tray<00:05:19.979> now<00:05:20.190> I'm<00:05:20.280> going<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.580> transport

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
cookie tray now I'm going to transport

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.839 
cookie tray now I'm going to transport
them<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.810> transfer<00:05:22.319> them<00:05:22.469> rather<00:05:22.680> into<00:05:23.639> these

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
them and transfer them rather into these

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.230 
them and transfer them rather into these
really<00:05:24.150> nice<00:05:24.560> foil<00:05:25.560> pans<00:05:25.979> that<00:05:26.190> come<00:05:27.000> with<00:05:27.210> a

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
really nice foil pans that come with a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.080 
really nice foil pans that come with a
lid<00:05:27.569> and<00:05:28.139> for<00:05:28.650> really<00:05:28.919> easy<00:05:29.190> storage<00:05:29.699> in<00:05:29.969> the

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
lid and for really easy storage in the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:41.920 
lid and for really easy storage in the
freezer<00:05:30.389> then<00:05:30.750> so<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.080> just<00:05:31.319> drop<00:05:32.250> them<00:05:32.490> in<00:05:32.639> here

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.420 

another<00:05:42.930> reason<00:05:43.349> why<00:05:43.500> we<00:05:43.710> butter<00:05:43.949> them<00:05:44.250> at

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
another reason why we butter them at

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.320 
another reason why we butter them at
this<00:05:44.610> stage<00:05:44.940> already<00:05:45.509> is<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:47.150> they<00:05:48.150> won't

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
this stage already is so they won't

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.279 
this stage already is so they won't
stick<00:05:48.719> together

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
stick together

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.330 
stick together
and<00:05:49.759> then<00:05:50.759> you<00:05:51.389> know<00:05:51.529> break<00:05:52.529> apart<00:05:52.919> when<00:05:53.039> we're

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
and then you know break apart when we're

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.360 
and then you know break apart when we're
later<00:05:53.550> later<00:05:54.029> dishing<00:05:54.870> them<00:05:55.020> out<00:05:55.259> and<00:05:56.159> I've

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
later later dishing them out and I've

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.189 
later later dishing them out and I've
got<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.580> layer<00:05:56.880> here<00:05:57.210> now<00:05:57.449> and<00:05:57.750> I'm<00:05:57.870> going<00:05:58.110> to

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
got a layer here now and I'm going to

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.080 
got a layer here now and I'm going to
take<00:05:58.529> a<00:05:58.560> little<00:05:58.889> bit<00:05:59.159> of<00:05:59.219> the<00:06:01.370> bread<00:06:02.370> crumbs

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
take a little bit of the bread crumbs

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.249 
take a little bit of the bread crumbs
and<00:06:05.180> sprinkle<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.210> on<00:06:06.389> and<00:06:06.779> then<00:06:06.930> I'm<00:06:07.080> going<00:06:07.229> to

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
and sprinkle it on and then I'm going to

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.040 
and sprinkle it on and then I'm going to
start<00:06:07.529> with<00:06:08.219> another<00:06:08.340> layer<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:09.050> stagger

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
start with another layer and stagger

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.600 
start with another layer and stagger
them<00:06:14.719> the<00:06:15.719> bread<00:06:15.960> crumbs<00:06:16.319> also<00:06:16.800> help<00:06:17.099> keep

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
them the bread crumbs also help keep

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:27.890 
them the bread crumbs also help keep
them<00:06:17.849> from<00:06:17.969> sticking<00:06:18.120> together<00:06:26.900> an

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
them from sticking together an

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.839 
them from sticking together an
alternative<00:06:28.469> technique<00:06:28.919> that<00:06:29.219> number<00:06:29.759> of

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
alternative technique that number of

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.519 
alternative technique that number of
people<00:06:30.150> have<00:06:30.330> used<00:06:30.539> and<00:06:30.779> we've<00:06:30.870> tried<00:06:31.169> it<00:06:31.349> and

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
people have used and we've tried it and

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.439 
people have used and we've tried it and
works<00:06:31.740> effectively<00:06:32.400> at<00:06:32.520> this<00:06:32.699> stage<00:06:33.000> is<00:06:33.240> once

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
works effectively at this stage is once

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.379 
works effectively at this stage is once
you've<00:06:33.629> boiled<00:06:33.960> them<00:06:34.349> is<00:06:35.190> to<00:06:35.699> flash-freeze

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
you've boiled them is to flash-freeze

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.860 
you've boiled them is to flash-freeze
them<00:06:36.629> on<00:06:36.840> a<00:06:36.870> cookie<00:06:37.110> tray<00:06:37.590> in<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:39.000> freezer

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
them on a cookie tray in the freezer

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.689 
them on a cookie tray in the freezer
and<00:06:40.080> then<00:06:40.620> you<00:06:40.710> can<00:06:40.830> just<00:06:41.069> place<00:06:41.310> them<00:06:41.520> in<00:06:41.639> a

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
and then you can just place them in a

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.760 
and then you can just place them in a
bag<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.240> take<00:06:42.419> them<00:06:42.630> out<00:06:42.750> we've<00:06:43.320> found<00:06:43.589> that

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
bag and take them out we've found that

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.670 
bag and take them out we've found that
these<00:06:43.949> hold<00:06:44.520> out<00:06:44.789> up<00:06:45.060> quite<00:06:45.630> well<00:06:45.659> for

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
these hold out up quite well for

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.360 
these hold out up quite well for
so<00:06:46.830> say<00:06:47.100> two<00:06:47.520> or<00:06:47.639> three<00:06:47.850> months<00:06:48.210> without<00:06:49.080> any

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
so say two or three months without any

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.680 
so say two or three months without any
noticeable<00:06:50.370> effect<00:06:51.290> we<00:06:52.290> don't<00:06:52.590> recommend

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
noticeable effect we don't recommend

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.330 
noticeable effect we don't recommend
putting<00:06:54.690> them<00:06:54.990> in<00:06:55.169> flash<00:06:55.590> freezing<00:06:56.100> them

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
putting them in flash freezing them

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.480 
putting them in flash freezing them
before<00:06:56.940> boiling<00:06:57.389> we've<00:06:58.139> tried<00:06:58.470> that<00:06:58.500> forgot

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
before boiling we've tried that forgot

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.310 
before boiling we've tried that forgot
about<00:06:59.759> them<00:06:59.970> actually<00:07:00.419> for<00:07:00.720> a<00:07:00.780> couple<00:07:01.139> months

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
about them actually for a couple months

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.189 
about them actually for a couple months
and<00:07:01.650> they<00:07:02.130> completely<00:07:02.520> desiccated<00:07:03.030> of<00:07:03.509> a

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
and they completely desiccated of a

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.740 
and they completely desiccated of a
moisture<00:07:04.740> so<00:07:05.039> blind<00:07:05.310> out<00:07:05.580> of<00:07:05.820> the<00:07:06.030> pierogi<00:07:06.539> and

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
moisture so blind out of the pierogi and

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.400 
moisture so blind out of the pierogi and
they<00:07:07.289> were<00:07:07.350> absolutely<00:07:08.280> no<00:07:08.430> good<00:07:09.259> we<00:07:10.259> got

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
they were absolutely no good we got

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.629 
they were absolutely no good we got
nothing<00:07:10.740> out<00:07:10.830> of<00:07:10.889> them<00:07:11.130> they're<00:07:11.250> to<00:07:11.310> be<00:07:11.430> thrown

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
nothing out of them they're to be thrown

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.789 
nothing out of them they're to be thrown
away
