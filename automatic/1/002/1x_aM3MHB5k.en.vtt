like that and now like you can't like
you<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.459> right<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.850> bottom

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you can see it right there in the bottom

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.490 
you can see it right there in the bottom
right<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.600> bit<00:02:24.750> let's<00:02:25.140> make<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.440> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
right a little bit let's make this a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
right a little bit let's make this a
little<00:02:25.590> bigger<00:02:25.739> if<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:27.000> bottom<00:02:27.239> right

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
little bigger if I can the bottom right

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.760 
little bigger if I can the bottom right
i<00:02:27.390> take<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> little<00:02:28.110> bit<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.320> need<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> crop

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
i take see a little bit you need to crop

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.580 
i take see a little bit you need to crop
a<00:02:28.830> little<00:02:29.160> more<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:29.959> like<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
a little more just like like that just a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470 
a little more just like like that just a
little<00:02:31.770> bit<00:02:31.860> more<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.310> now<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.000> can't<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.390> it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
little bit more and now you can't see it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540 
little bit more and now you can't see it
so<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> regular<00:02:34.200> recording<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:35.430> now

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so it's like a regular recording so now

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.770 
so it's like a regular recording so now
uses<00:02:35.910> regular<00:02:36.090> recording

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
uses regular recording

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
uses regular recording

except<00:02:59.230> for<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.470> bottom<00:02:59.830> parts<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.160> little

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
except for the bottom parts a little

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.309 
except for the bottom parts a little
cropped<00:03:00.580> out<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.060> let<00:03:01.840> me<00:03:01.930> give<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.230> little

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
cropped out so let me give that little

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:12.270 
cropped out so let me give that little
fix<00:03:02.739> right<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:07.650> there's<00:03:08.650> mess<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.130> up<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:11.280> think

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
fix right now there's mess it up I think

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.130 
fix right now there's mess it up I think
that<00:03:12.340> only<00:03:12.580> as<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.940> does<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:13.480> I'm

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
that only as it does that is because I'm

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.540 
that only as it does that is because I'm
trying<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.590> crop<00:03:14.830> out<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.160> little<00:03:15.370> part

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
trying to crop out that little part

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.160 
trying to crop out that little part
right<00:03:15.580> there<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:17.910> well<00:03:18.910> guess<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.269> is<00:03:19.390> perfect

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
right there so well guess it is perfect

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.900 
right there so well guess it is perfect
basically<00:03:20.680> because<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.160> barely<00:03:21.459> see<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
basically because you can barely see the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.970 
basically because you can barely see the
bottom<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.390> right<00:03:22.569> there<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.019> let<00:03:23.860> me

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
bottom of that right there so let me

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.550 
bottom of that right there so let me
just<00:03:24.220> move<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.430> back<00:03:24.790> up<00:03:25.120> I'm<00:03:26.050> sorry<00:03:26.500> I

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
just move that back up I'm sorry I

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.650 
just move that back up I'm sorry I
dragged<00:03:26.800> into<00:03:26.950> my<00:03:27.100> other<00:03:27.190> screen<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:28.420> just

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
dragged into my other screen you just

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.090 
dragged into my other screen you just
move<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.410> up<00:03:30.160> above<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:31.000> little<00:03:32.100> make

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
move that that up above that little make

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.600 
move that that up above that little make
sure<00:03:33.280> both<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.550> these<00:03:33.880> are<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.330> corners

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
sure both of these are the corners

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.120 
sure both of these are the corners
alright<00:03:36.610> that's<00:03:36.940> good<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.269> guess<00:03:37.680> no<00:03:38.680> reasons

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
alright that's good I guess no reasons

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.130 
alright that's good I guess no reasons
doing<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.730> disabled<00:03:40.630> resampling

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
doing that because a disabled resampling

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.819 
doing that because a disabled resampling
which<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.440> have<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> custom<00:03:42.160> thing<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.579> but<00:03:43.829> so

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
which I have a custom thing for but so

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.620 
which I have a custom thing for but so
now<00:03:44.950> just<00:03:45.100> made<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.430> one<00:03:45.760> like<00:03:46.090> 20<00:03:46.420> times

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
now just made it one like 20 times

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.569 
now just made it one like 20 times
easier<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.170> record<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.340> zero

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
easier to record and you get like zero

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.100 
easier to record and you get like zero
