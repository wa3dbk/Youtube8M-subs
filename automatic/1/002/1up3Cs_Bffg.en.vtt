00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
scenes in this impact area help keep it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
scenes in this impact area help keep it
safe<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.650> intact<00:01:29.040> also<00:01:29.700> you'll<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.150> some

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
safe and intact also you'll see some

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
safe and intact also you'll see some
vents<00:01:30.630> molded<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.110> these<00:01:31.320> things<00:01:31.530> the

vents molded into these things the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
vents molded into these things the
dynamic<00:01:32.460> friction<00:01:32.610> shield<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.270> their

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
dynamic friction shield that's their

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.249 
dynamic friction shield that's their
fancy<00:01:33.840> names

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
fancy names

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660

that's<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.799> hard<00:01:35.009> protection<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.549> we're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's this hard protection that we're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
that's this hard protection that we're
talking<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
talking about so on the back of the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
talking about so on the back of the
elbow<00:01:37.439> you'll<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.100> expansion<00:01:38.670> panel

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
elbow you'll see this expansion panel

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
elbow you'll see this expansion panel
these<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.810> perforated<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.799> are

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
these are perforated as well they are

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.649 
these are perforated as well they are
made<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.400> leather<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.119> an<00:01:42.210> expensive

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
made from leather it's an expensive

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.969 
made from leather it's an expensive
process<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.110> build<00:01:43.409> these<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.590> leather<00:01:43.799> but

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
process to build these from leather but

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.260 
process to build these from leather but
you've<00:01:44.100> got<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> cover<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.970> good<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you've got to have that cover so good to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.639 
you've got to have that cover so good to
see<00:01:45.390> those<00:01:45.540> perforated<00:01:46.170> they're<00:01:46.259> aramid

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
see those perforated they're aramid

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.190 
see those perforated they're aramid
reinforced<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.340> well<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.090> let's<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
reinforced as well so let's go to the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.749 
reinforced as well so let's go to the
back<00:01:49.350> real<00:01:49.590> quick<00:01:49.799> we'll<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> look<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.520> top

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
back real quick we'll take a look up top

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.219 
back real quick we'll take a look up top
this<00:01:51.090> starts<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.780> interesting<00:01:52.140> as

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this starts to get very interesting as

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
this starts to get very interesting as
well<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.619> addition<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:54.119> large

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
well in addition to these really large

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.789 
well in addition to these really large
panels<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:54.930> those<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.320> expansion

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
panels here those are those expansion

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
panels here those are those expansion
panels<00:01:56.130> talked<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.880> note<00:01:57.060> about

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
panels talked about and one note about

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
panels talked about and one note about
those<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.899> are<00:01:58.049> built<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> 45<00:01:58.979> degree

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
those they are built at a 45 degree

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.649 
those they are built at a 45 degree
angle<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.790> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.000> think<00:02:00.149> about<00:02:00.240> being<00:02:00.509> in

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
angle so if you think about being in

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.389 
angle so if you think about being in
that<00:02:00.719> sportbike<00:02:01.200> position<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that sportbike position it's going to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.459 
that sportbike position it's going to
crush<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> expand<00:02:03.270> exactly<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.259> way<00:02:04.409> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
crush and expand exactly the way you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
crush and expand exactly the way you
need<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.549> really<00:02:05.909> nice<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> see

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
need it to so that's really nice to see

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.839 
need it to so that's really nice to see
that<00:02:06.479> design<00:02:06.810> also<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> aerodynamic

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that design also this is the aerodynamic

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.690 
that design also this is the aerodynamic
speed<00:02:09.450> hump<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.780> top<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> hollow-core

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
speed hump on top it's a hollow-core

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.800 
speed hump on top it's a hollow-core
lightweight<00:02:11.700> promotes<00:02:12.150> airflow<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> help

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
lightweight promotes airflow to help

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.150 
lightweight promotes airflow to help
keep<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.200> cool<00:02:13.440> and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
keep you cool and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.930 
keep you cool and
you're<00:02:14.370> also<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
you're also going to see the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.520 
you're also going to see the
perforations<00:02:15.540> throughout<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.410> is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
perforations throughout so this is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.110 
perforations throughout so this is
really<00:02:16.740> designed<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.280> help<00:02:17.460> keep<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.910> cool

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
really designed to help keep you cool

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.970 
really designed to help keep you cool
something<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:19.050> great<00:02:19.320> about<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> suit<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
something that's great about this suit a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.890 
something that's great about this suit a
new<00:02:20.130> addition<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.820> aromatic<00:02:21.270> stretch<00:02:21.630> fiber

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
new addition this aromatic stretch fiber

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.080 
new addition this aromatic stretch fiber
across<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.620> top<00:02:22.860> panel<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.790> allows<00:02:24.060> for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
across the top panel and this allows for

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.730 
across the top panel and this allows for
a<00:02:24.330> lot<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> flexibility<00:02:25.350> as<00:02:25.440> you're<00:02:25.530> trying<00:02:25.650> to
