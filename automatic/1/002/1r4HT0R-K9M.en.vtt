are looking really big things are barely
fitting<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> screen<00:00:12.570> what<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> want<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> do

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
fitting on the screen what I want to do

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.400 
fitting on the screen what I want to do
is<00:00:13.530> try<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.889> fix<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.549> by<00:00:15.049> making<00:00:16.049> sure<00:00:16.199> my

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
is try to fix this by making sure my

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.990 
is try to fix this by making sure my
screen<00:00:16.680> resolution<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> at<00:00:17.910> its<00:00:18.270> maximum<00:00:20.000> so

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
screen resolution is at its maximum so

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300 
screen resolution is at its maximum so
going<00:00:21.689> into<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> screen<00:00:22.380> resolution<00:00:22.529> panel

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
going into the screen resolution panel

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.019 
going into the screen resolution panel
here<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.990> first<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.109> all<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.529> see<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.029> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
here and first of all I can see that the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.410 
here and first of all I can see that the
maximum<00:00:27.570> resolution<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.470> limited<00:00:29.269> 1024<00:00:30.269> by

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
maximum resolution is limited 1024 by

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.860 
maximum resolution is limited 1024 by
768<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:31.700> monitor<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:33.210> go<00:00:33.329> much<00:00:33.570> higher<00:00:33.600> than

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
768 my monitor can go much higher than

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
768 my monitor can go much higher than
this<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.860> wondering<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> an

this so I'm wondering if there is an
issue<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> software<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.040> going

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
issue with the software so we're going

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.139 
issue with the software so we're going
to<00:00:38.190> check<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.730> out

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
here letting me know that there's
something<00:01:18.060> wrong<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:19.380> my<00:01:19.740> chipset<00:01:20.460> family

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
something wrong with my chipset family

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.420 
something wrong with my chipset family
or<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.120> is<00:01:21.270> my<00:01:21.390> onboard<00:01:21.660> video<00:01:22.320> driver<00:01:22.680> okay

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
or this is my onboard video driver okay

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
or this is my onboard video driver okay
so<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.510> I'm<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> try<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.110> next

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so the what I'm going to try to do next

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.130 
so the what I'm going to try to do next
is<00:01:25.650> find<00:01:26.400> an<00:01:26.700> updated<00:01:27.300> driver<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
is find an updated driver on the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.490 
is find an updated driver on the
Internet<00:01:29.720> see<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.290> fix<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:32.040> problem

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.149 

all<00:01:37.500> right

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.260 

and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:41.210> believe<00:01:41.750> if<00:01:42.590> we<00:01:42.790> just<00:01:43.790> double<00:01:43.970> check

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
and I believe if we just double check

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.340 
and I believe if we just double check
here<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:44.479> we<00:01:44.570> go<00:01:44.689> back<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.619> says<00:01:46.360> until<00:01:47.360> 9:45

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
here if we go back it says until 9:45

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.680 
here if we go back it says until 9:45
Express<00:01:49.220> chips<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.700> family<00:01:50.119> all<00:01:50.330> right<00:01:50.390> so

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
Express chips of family all right so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.960 
Express chips of family all right so
what<00:01:50.869> I'm<00:01:50.930> going<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.200> is<00:01:51.380> just<00:01:51.560> look<00:01:51.710> up

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.070 
what I'm going to do is just look up
find<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> Intel<00:01:53.390> drivers<00:01:53.960> page<00:01:54.590> here<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.070> is

hopefully that I'm an ually found the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.340 
hopefully that I'm an ually found the
drivers<00:02:58.880> online<00:02:59.299> hopefully<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.900> will<00:03:00.109> work

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
drivers online hopefully this will work

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.400 
drivers online hopefully this will work
here<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.010> then<00:03:01.760> accept<00:03:02.239> that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.100 

and<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.880> installation<00:03:08.420> process<00:03:09.080> will

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
and this installation process will

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.660 
and this installation process will
probably<00:03:09.440> take<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> while<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:10.340> I'm<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.550> going
