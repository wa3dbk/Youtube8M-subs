nicely it does have a very sheer

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.310 
nicely it does have a very sheer
consistency<00:01:12.700> that's<00:01:12.909> why<00:01:13.060> it's<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.270> luster<00:01:13.720> but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
consistency that's why it's a luster but

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.630

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739

really<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.250> pale<00:03:05.430> complexion<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.239> just

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
really really pale complexion is just

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360 
really really pale complexion is just
like<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> bit<00:03:06.780> sickly<00:03:07.140> with<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.530> car<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.250> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
like a bit sickly with this car but it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.910 
like a bit sickly with this car but it
is<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> really<00:03:08.790> nice<00:03:08.970> color<00:03:09.390> nevertheless<00:03:10.050> so

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
is a really nice color nevertheless so

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.210 
is a really nice color nevertheless so
I'm<00:03:11.100> gonna<00:03:11.190> try<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.459> one<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.700> now

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.640 

I<00:03:20.570> really<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.780> lipstick<00:03:22.170> but<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.410> find

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
I really like this lipstick but I find

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.470 
I really like this lipstick but I find
that<00:03:22.800> if<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.070> was<00:03:23.160> just<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.370> touch<00:03:23.580> lighter<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that if it was just a touch lighter I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970 
that if it was just a touch lighter I
probably<00:03:24.900> wouldn't<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.650> because<00:03:25.890> it'd

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
probably wouldn't like it because it'd

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.830 
probably wouldn't like it because it'd
be<00:03:26.010> too<00:03:26.100> pale<00:03:26.490> for<00:03:26.520> me<00:03:26.850> but<00:03:27.330> actually<00:03:27.450> we

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
be too pale for me but actually we

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.050 
be too pale for me but actually we
really<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.320> one<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.700> hint<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
really like this one so it's a hint of

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.790 
really like this one so it's a hint of
purplish<00:03:30.510> pink<00:03:30.570> but<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
purplish pink but I really like it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.880 
purplish pink but I really like it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
this one is a amplified finish so I

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.110 
this one is a amplified finish so I
really<00:03:55.800> like<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> amplifiers<00:03:56.490> are<00:03:56.700> very<00:03:56.730> very

gonna<00:07:02.280> try<00:07:02.460> this<00:07:02.520> one<00:07:02.730> on<00:07:02.760> the<00:07:02.940> lips<00:07:03.120> now

you
it's<00:07:13.860> a<00:07:13.920> really<00:07:14.190> nice<00:07:14.250> dark<00:07:14.610> vampy<00:07:14.970> color<00:07:15.180> but

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
it's a really nice dark vampy color but

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.270 
it's a really nice dark vampy color but
I<00:07:15.720> will<00:07:15.870> admit<00:07:16.170> it<00:07:16.320> looks<00:07:16.440> more<00:07:16.680> powerful<00:07:17.160> in

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
I will admit it looks more powerful in

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.250 
I will admit it looks more powerful in
the<00:07:17.370> tube<00:07:17.580> than<00:07:17.820> it<00:07:17.910> does<00:07:18.060> on<00:07:18.090> the<00:07:18.270> lips<00:07:18.510> on<00:07:18.810> the

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
the tube than it does on the lips on the

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.600 
the tube than it does on the lips on the
lips<00:07:19.410> it<00:07:19.680> comes<00:07:19.890> off<00:07:20.010> a<00:07:20.100> bit<00:07:20.220> more<00:07:20.370> redder

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
lips it comes off a bit more redder

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.160 
lips it comes off a bit more redder
because<00:07:20.910> it<00:07:21.000> has<00:07:21.090> a<00:07:21.120> red<00:07:21.420> undertone<00:07:21.750> to<00:07:22.080> this

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.800 
because it has a red undertone to this
color<00:07:22.440> but<00:07:22.980> it's<00:07:23.130> amazing<00:07:23.730> the<00:07:24.120> only<00:07:24.450> problem
