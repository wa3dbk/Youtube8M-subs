00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.639
 Well 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 this is a vertical shelving 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.439
 composed of 420 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.090
 sectioning you see every every screw of 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:34.899
 what is equivalent to a binary m is a 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.899
 sectioning that is controlled 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.170
 from a control unit from me it is built that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.170
 this one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:56.850
 this unit has the prerogative here 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:05.070
 to supply one or more cut-outs 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:09.520
 as you can see if sectioning of the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.590
 closet let's call it and then there is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.590
 sectioning of the moving part 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:27.790
 in addition there is exchanges that allow 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.070
 the entry and exit of trains by both 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.770
 sides 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.780
 so from that phantom station that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:43.660
 you saw when i wanted to put away or 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.950
 a locomotive from a train he takes the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:51.700
 road the one of patience made facts 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 which I am alone to make see take 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 the street 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.840
 here is me and leo now 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.780
 I'm going to look for a free place 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.570
 during the climb I can also stop it 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.820
 you can choose what you can do 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.710
 want more now look i can go 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:39.060
 to take that train that he is there 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.060
 stops being the nation exchanges 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.980
 they were moving this here I can to 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:58.800
 take action now exchanges 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:03.230
 necessary here it is 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.230
 exchanges I do the inversion 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:16.280
 and the locomotive this one takes here 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:21.730
 the place of the other block 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.560
 the power of that machine do them 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.459
 feeding back to this machine 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.459
 here action the exchange 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.340
 and the car 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.340
 takes the place of the other 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.440
 and so on once he has placed 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.780
 note that we also pantographed on and 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.910
 they also exchange a graph 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.760
 once he has placed this warehouse 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.319
 allows or also this was born for 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.569
 hospitalization of locomotives 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.860
 it goes without saying that to make number of 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:15.190
 sectioning but it will also 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.579
 expand it through this let's call it 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.960
 of the elevator and continue with gods 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.820
 tracks as long as you want and yes 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.330
 will always create with his own system 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.730
 another warehouse this can wheel for 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.640
 the trains formed by two and a half meters three 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.930
 meters what you want and so without 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:42.190
 touching them can be sent to that 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.410
 when the model is finished now 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.160
 really finished thank you 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.160
 listening
