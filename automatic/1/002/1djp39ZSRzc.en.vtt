now<00:01:26.960> what<00:01:27.650> this<00:01:27.800> technique<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.340> about<00:01:28.490> I'm

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
now what this technique is about I'm

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.450 
now what this technique is about I'm
snapping<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.200> stick<00:01:30.470> as<00:01:30.650> I<00:01:30.800> come<00:01:30.980> down<00:01:31.010> with

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
snapping the stick as I come down with

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490 
snapping the stick as I come down with
my<00:01:31.640> fingers<00:01:32.090> I'm<00:01:32.480> snapping<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.110> stick<00:01:33.350> with

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
my fingers I'm snapping the stick with

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.610 
my fingers I'm snapping the stick with
my<00:01:33.620> fingers<00:01:34.040> as<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.610> come<00:01:34.790> down<00:01:34.820> with<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> wrist

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
my fingers as I come down with the wrist

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.780 
my fingers as I come down with the wrist
and<00:01:36.700> that's<00:01:37.700> what<00:01:37.940> I'm<00:01:38.120> doing<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.610> maybe<00:01:40.610> a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
and that's what I'm doing and maybe a

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.430 
and that's what I'm doing and maybe a
good<00:01:41.090> way<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.360> explain<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.020> know<00:01:42.230> that

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
good way to explain that you know that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.110 
good way to explain that you know that
possible<00:01:42.770> technique<00:01:43.190> I'm<00:01:43.490> pretty<00:01:43.790> sure<00:01:43.940> than

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
possible technique I'm pretty sure than

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.890 
possible technique I'm pretty sure than
many<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.570> guys<00:01:44.750> know<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:46.340> come<00:01:46.550> down

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
many of you guys know it as I come down

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.740 
many of you guys know it as I come down
I'm<00:01:47.900> pushing<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> stake<00:01:48.940> I'm<00:01:49.940> not<00:01:50.180> using<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
I'm pushing the stake I'm not using the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.350 
I'm pushing the stake I'm not using the
toe<00:01:50.960> parts<00:01:51.440> I'm<00:01:51.740> not<00:01:52.070> pulling<00:01:52.490> there's

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
toe parts I'm not pulling there's

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.660 
toe parts I'm not pulling there's
another<00:01:53.660> thing<00:01:53.930> I'm<00:01:54.680> just<00:01:54.980> pushing<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.460> stick

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
another thing I'm just pushing the stick

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.710 
another thing I'm just pushing the stick
and<00:01:56.210> creating<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.840> space<00:01:57.110> between<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:59.180> palm

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
and creating the space between the palm

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.750 
and creating the space between the palm
of<00:01:59.900> my<00:01:59.960> hand<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.770> stick<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.190> see<00:02:01.370> that<00:02:01.550> it

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
of my hand and the stick you see that it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.750 
of my hand and the stick you see that it
is<00:02:01.880> very<00:02:02.060> important<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.990> snap<00:02:03.230> snap<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.670> I

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
is very important it snap snap and I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.980 
is very important it snap snap and I
create<00:02:05.150> in<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.450> space<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.450> way<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> got

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
create in the space so and the way I got

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.740 
create in the space so and the way I got
it<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.590> know<00:02:12.160> very<00:02:14.410> fast<00:02:16.270> we<00:02:17.270> started<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
it you know very fast we started the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.450 
it you know very fast we started the
first<00:02:17.990> lesson<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> stick<00:02:18.680> ponying<00:02:19.070> up<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
first lesson to stick ponying up to the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.880 
first lesson to stick ponying up to the
ceiling<00:02:19.910> coming<00:02:20.210> down<00:02:20.560> snapping<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> stick

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
ceiling coming down snapping the stick

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.230 
ceiling coming down snapping the stick
with<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:22.160> fingers<00:02:22.520> going<00:02:22.760> back<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
with my fingers going back to the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.220 
with my fingers going back to the
starting<00:02:23.570> position

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
starting position

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.680 
starting position
coming<00:02:24.710> down<00:02:24.970> pushing<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.210> stick<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.570> my

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
coming down pushing the stick with my

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.030 
coming down pushing the stick with my
fingers<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.320> out<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> start<00:02:27.890> position

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
fingers going out of the start position

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.020 
fingers going out of the start position
coming<00:02:28.760> down<00:02:29.320> snap<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.770> going<00:02:31.130> back<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:32.000> know

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
coming down snap and going back you know

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.560 
coming down snap and going back you know
and<00:02:32.660> once<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.020> get<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.350> stuff<00:02:33.650> up<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.100> speed

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
and once I get this stuff up to speed

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.060 
and once I get this stuff up to speed
you<00:02:35.570> know<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.750> added<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.320> modern<00:02:36.680> technique

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
you know I added the modern technique

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.660 
you know I added the modern technique
they<00:02:37.700> say<00:02:37.910> before<00:02:38.120> snaps<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:40.340> are<00:02:40.550> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
they say before snaps you are the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.660 
they say before snaps you are the
whipping<00:02:41.060> motion

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
whipping motion

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:51.849

and<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:54.209> way<00:02:54.390> together<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:55.140> was<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:57.090> my

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and the way together it was like in my

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.589 
and the way together it was like in my
case<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.719> was<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> very<00:02:58.290> well<00:02:58.560> planned

I<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:06.150> think<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.569> something<00:03:06.930> that

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
I think don't think is something that

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.209 
I think don't think is something that
you<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.379> learn<00:03:08.310> overnight<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.980> not

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
you can learn overnight but it's not

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.099 
you can learn overnight but it's not
that<00:03:11.430> difficult<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:12.209> long<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.989> a

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
that difficult as long as you do it a

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.470 
that difficult as long as you do it a
little<00:03:13.290> bit<00:03:13.500> every<00:03:13.829> day<00:03:13.909> so<00:03:14.909> this<00:03:15.299> is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
little bit every day so this is

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.020 
little bit every day so this is
technique<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.319> power<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.889> speed<00:03:17.310> without

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
technique to power and speed without

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.669 
technique to power and speed without
getting<00:03:18.389> tendonitis<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:20.069> stay<00:03:20.340> tuned
