right now is infinite but and I'm
holding<00:03:24.079> down<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.470> tree<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.650> you're<00:03:24.980> just

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
every time you shot him and be like

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.450 
every time you shot him and be like
sweet<00:06:13.400> like<00:06:13.760> a<00:06:13.790> level<00:06:14.210> off<00:06:14.300> mission<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.460> but

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
sweet like a level off mission and but

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.650 
sweet like a level off mission and but
there's<00:06:16.610> no<00:06:17.020> redeeming<00:06:18.430> factors<00:06:19.430> about<00:06:20.390> how

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
there's no redeeming factors about how

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.250 
there's no redeeming factors about how
long<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:21.050> takes

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.890 

and<00:06:24.710> then<00:06:26.440> hook<00:06:27.440> up<00:06:27.620> some<00:06:27.800> guys<00:06:28.010> I<00:06:28.630> had<00:06:29.630> to<00:06:29.780> edit
