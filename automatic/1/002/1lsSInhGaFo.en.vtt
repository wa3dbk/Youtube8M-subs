00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.280
 the complicated date of life in one of those 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.340
 favela well produced before the video only 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.410
 for faith ok my god is what happens 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.020
 this one in my house 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.189
 whoa hands crazy animal rescue people 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.730
 it was practically people it was not a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.310
 lousy performance I know that the solution 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.310
 one for a motivator only one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.840
 poor state not ready is a plugin ok 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 Do you remember that stop there? 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.149
 that I made in that version there and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 tava everyone likes and everything like one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.629
 Dad, because I had to take the staff. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.610
 I like it, and I decided to bring it. 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.039
 here is one thing you take the time to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.960
 It's me who decided to bring one more 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.090
 block comma stop that there in the rs 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 as a block but she of the new version I 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 I decided that transit is also the new 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.199
 version here which is a tutorial and basic 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.140
 to take the gravity out of maine craft ok 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.280
 so let's go to the other 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.530
 Chores are not right, I'm back here all 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.250
 It's a bitch, it's all right, this is me. 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.650
 here a ridiculous texture but ok pa to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.200
 stop here is the next in the new 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.759
 versions changed the neighborhood parade here vi 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 so you're going to have to put your 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.990
 name your name bug 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.450
 I write minecraft later on behalf of the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.610
 block or the commander 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 the cast of the commander not want to send 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.939
 command 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 now yes the commander underline bloch 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.950
 if it passes the user then thereafter 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.259
 You're going to put me here otherwise ok 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.140
 little girl and you are going to put 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.180
 this command here I put control c 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 v control because I will not get 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.960
 I can make the key is that in this mine 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.430
 keyboard until today I got it is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.229
 so it works the same as the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.060
 mainland and with people I do not know but it is 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.180
 this command here that will make 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.360
 entities only that furniture and other 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.009
 things can not be more serious and 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.520
 now practice this as you go 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.740
 need to 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.930
 other return I use block which is more 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.670
 easy to break ok you will do the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.570
 next you will make this system 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.090
 here it is ok to take one of these 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.970
 redstone here redstone here and want stone 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.830
 here ok later to activate you can 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.440
 put a torch also if you want to 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.030
 creative mode does not have a 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.580
 survival mode has no way to 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.580
 boot then block even you put that 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.110
 It is ok it will give these animals will 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.450
 start flying but first I have to 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.390
 make a bug and then comad 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.000
 Fake bock here for concentrating looks 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.070
 this they start to fly for many is 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.540
 they're just bizarre they're flying up to 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.360
 the infinite ok 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.640
 and this is it here is the command is the 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.040
 command for you guys do it from here on 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 map of you now connect people 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.300
 I care the ball, how was that system? 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.490
 of them staying upside down is 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.460
 simple face you're just going to pick up 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.090
 the send is a new one 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.490
 I'm going to put here dener shiner 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.650
 The way I wrote it here and will do it 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.110
 with which it is upside down 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.940
 here when you see it will come out going 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.950
 to be upside down here does not 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.060
 works with any mob even with 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.500
 flu with slime and let show here 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.050
 For you wrote denner good not all 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.350
 Deboni write not only now but 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.180
 in this beautiful fit of nerves you have to 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.610
 write the way I 'm doing - 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.200
 but does not work guys check this out they 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.070
 will stay upside down will stay 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.630
 hung 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.120
 the list to put out here they will 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.390
 fly the main forever because 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.390
 stop to get good 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.580
 now to stop or to make the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.680
 gravity to work again let's say 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.440
 so it's only you break you want 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.930
 play a little more you change this one 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.300
 here for 50 dude and look what 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.070
 It happens they are falling slowly and 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.810
 takes a fall damage as if it were a 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.989
 very big face fall 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.709
 binds in all exams that will begin 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.570
 Flying 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.470
 I'm going to start raising damages and no one 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.160
 Look at this where it took the damage there only your 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.260
 from slime mano 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.360
 much of the old time and if I put 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.310
 Some way here he's going to stay like this. 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.470
 even at home and if I put him here 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.960
 he thinks he can not move 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.550
 Why is he doing this well? 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.730
 slowly because it's like it 's a 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.500
 very high gravity in kraft number 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.090
 raise a damage sac 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.760
 so all the Libyans that I put 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.350
 here they will start to fall normally 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.870
 Okay, I would do the following to put a 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.410
 normal Islamic slide I'm still going to change 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.840
 50 to 1 again and the furniture goes 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.220
 begin to fly sack that put all 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.730
 these lines here 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:08.960
 already they will start coming back is because 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.790
 because I'm going to change here from one to 50 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.800
 only the command will fall into the description 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.460
