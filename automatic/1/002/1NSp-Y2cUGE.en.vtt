00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.309 

now<00:00:03.000> you're<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.480> take<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.899> length<00:00:04.140> of

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
now you're going to take the length of

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.960 
now you're going to take the length of
yarn<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.830> finger<00:00:05.130> knitted<00:00:05.400> twice<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
yarn that you finger knitted twice and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.849 
yarn that you finger knitted twice and
you're<00:00:06.359> going<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.720> form<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.049> into<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.319> spiral<00:00:07.830> to

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
you're going to form it into a spiral to

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.520 
you're going to form it into a spiral to
make<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.400> flower<00:00:08.639> so<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.870> start<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:10.170> one

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
make the flower so just start with one

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.189 
make the flower so just start with one
end<00:00:10.910> fold<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> then<00:00:13.639> make<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> spiral

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.710 

like<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:22.880> then<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.090> you're<00:00:24.210> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.480> do

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
like this then what you're going to do

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
like this then what you're going to do
is<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> take<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.400> two

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
is you're going to take the two

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.970 
is you're going to take the two
toothpicks<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.449> you're<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> stick

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
toothpicks and you're going to stick

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.250 
toothpicks and you're going to stick
them<00:00:29.220> through<00:00:32.120> the<00:00:33.120> spiral<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
them through the spiral like that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.889 
them through the spiral like that
this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> hold<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.430> place<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:36.090> we

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
this is just to hold it in place as we

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.380 
this is just to hold it in place as we
sew<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.200> together

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
sew it together

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.709 
sew it together
so<00:00:39.390> there's<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.360> make<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
so there's one and then you can make the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.970 
so there's one and then you can make the
other<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.410> across<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> other<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:45.980> trying

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
other one go across the other way trying

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
other one go across the other way trying
to<00:00:47.100> catch<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.460> many<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.059> rows<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to catch as many of the rows of the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
to catch as many of the rows of the
spiral<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:50.960> like<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.910> doesn't<00:00:53.910> have

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
spiral as you can like that doesn't have

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.700 
spiral as you can like that doesn't have
to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.360> perfect<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> hold<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> in

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
to be perfect it's just to hold it in

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520 
to be perfect it's just to hold it in
place<00:00:55.860> while<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.940> sew<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.320> then<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.440> gonna

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
place while we sew it then you're gonna

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
place while we sew it then you're gonna
take<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> 24<00:01:00.300> inch<00:01:00.449> lengths<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.840> yarn

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
take one of the 24 inch lengths of yarn

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
take one of the 24 inch lengths of yarn
the<00:01:01.260> same<00:01:01.500> color<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:01.980> flower<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.670> thread

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the same color as your flower and thread

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.179 
the same color as your flower and thread
it<00:01:03.149> onto<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> plastic<00:01:03.690> yarn<00:01:04.140> needle<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> then

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it onto the plastic yarn needle and then

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.700 
it onto the plastic yarn needle and then
you're<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.400> make<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> knot<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> end<00:01:06.710> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you're gonna make a knot at the end so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
you're gonna make a knot at the end so
in<00:01:08.040> order<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:08.880> gonna<00:01:09.000> wrap

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
in order to do that you're gonna wrap

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
in order to do that you're gonna wrap
the<00:01:09.689> yarn<00:01:09.720> around<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.950> needle<00:01:11.010> three<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:11.909> four

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the yarn around the needle three or four

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
the yarn around the needle three or four
times<00:01:12.920> slide<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.460> needle<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:16.409> down

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
times slide it down the needle and down

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.200 
times slide it down the needle and down
the<00:01:17.220> yarn<00:01:17.630> like<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> form<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> knot

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
the yarn like that just to form a knot

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.230 
the yarn like that just to form a knot
then<00:01:21.500> you're<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.770> sew<00:01:23.220> through<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
then you're just gonna sew through the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
then you're just gonna sew through the
spiral<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> threaded<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
spiral just like you threaded the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.050 
spiral just like you threaded the
toothpicks<00:01:29.369> through<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:29.759> that's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
toothpicks through there that's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
toothpicks through there that's
basically<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
basically all you're gonna do with the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.620 
basically all you're gonna do with the
needle<00:01:33.710> like<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.030> gonna<00:01:36.150> pull

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
needle like that and you're gonna pull

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
needle like that and you're gonna pull
it<00:01:36.659> pull<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:38.430> tight<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:41.220> you're

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it pull it tight like that so you're

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.270 
it pull it tight like that so you're
gonna<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.850> back<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.390> forth<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
gonna just go back and forth with the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.319 
gonna just go back and forth with the
needle<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.509> thread<00:01:45.710> through<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> spiral

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.789 

through<00:01:52.329> all<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.630> layers<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.289> spiral

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
through all the layers of the spiral

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:05.460 
through all the layers of the spiral
like<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:59.430> that<00:02:00.430> it's<00:02:00.610> held<00:02:00.789> in<00:02:00.909> place<00:02:04.470> so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
like that so that it's held in place so

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.020 
like that so that it's held in place so
keep<00:02:05.679> going<00:02:05.710> you'll<00:02:06.250> want<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.579> go<00:02:06.670> back<00:02:06.850> and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
keep going you'll want to go back and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.540 
keep going you'll want to go back and
forth<00:02:07.270> maybe<00:02:07.990> eight<00:02:08.470> or<00:02:08.500> ten<00:02:08.860> times<00:02:09.099> just

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
forth maybe eight or ten times just

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.160 
forth maybe eight or ten times just
enough<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.420> gonna<00:02:10.599> stay<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.929> place

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
enough so that it's gonna stay in place

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.489 
enough so that it's gonna stay in place
once<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.560> take<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.890> toothpicks<00:02:12.310> out
