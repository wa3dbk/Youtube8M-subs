00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
so I'm going to take that over to the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.660 
so I'm going to take that over to the
other<00:02:01.790> side<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.960> make<00:02:03.140> sure<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:04.190> I'm<00:02:04.340> cutting

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
other side to make sure that I'm cutting

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it exactly the same length so line it

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.800 
it exactly the same length so line it
all<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.959> then<00:02:10.120> would<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.330> line<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.630> just

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
all up then would you the line you just

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.390

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.039 
actual jacket and look you're going to
have<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.610> stretch<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.750> lot

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
have to really really stretch it a lot

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.990 
have to really really stretch it a lot
when<00:03:03.799> you<00:03:03.860> sew<00:03:04.190> because<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.549> need<00:03:04.730> all<00:03:04.940> of

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
when you sew because you need all of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.460 
when you sew because you need all of
this<00:03:05.360> fabric<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:06.110> be<00:03:06.290> flush<00:03:06.680> when<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.610> sew

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
this fabric to be flush when you sew

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.530 
this fabric to be flush when you sew
I'd<00:03:09.470> say<00:03:09.709> it's<00:03:09.860> very<00:03:10.190> very<00:03:10.579> important<00:03:11.269> that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
I'd say it's very very important that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.500 
I'd say it's very very important that
you<00:03:11.690> don't<00:03:11.900> twist<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.500> lining<00:03:13.100> round<00:03:13.790> so

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
you don't twist that lining round so

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.990 
you don't twist that lining round so
make<00:03:14.720> sure<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.500> sites<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.370> seam<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
make sure that the sites the seam of the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.830 
make sure that the sites the seam of the
lining<00:03:17.390> matches<00:03:18.260> with<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.980> seam<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
lining matches with the seam of the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.380 
lining matches with the seam of the
actual<00:03:20.840> jacket<00:03:21.079> sleeve<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.910> hold<00:03:23.180> those

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
actual jacket sleeve you hold those

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.940 
actual jacket sleeve you hold those
together<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.140> they<00:03:24.230> twist<00:03:24.560> around<00:03:24.799> when

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
together so if they twist around when

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.990 
together so if they twist around when
you<00:03:25.010> go<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.190> put<00:03:25.340> your<00:03:25.370> arm<00:03:25.640> in<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:25.910> all

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
going to be twisted and then put it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.960

on number three back to some forwards

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.810 
on number three back to some forwards
now<00:03:38.350> really<00:03:39.350> really<00:03:40.070> stretch<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.910> sock<00:03:42.820> but

very<00:03:50.510> wide<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:52.160> I'm<00:03:52.400> pulling<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.060> at<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.750> back

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
so really pulling it I'm nearly at the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.479 
so really pulling it I'm nearly at the
end<00:04:03.120> which<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.630> good<00:04:03.900> because<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.010> has<00:04:05.220> been<00:04:05.459> a

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
end which is good because it has been a

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.430 
end which is good because it has been a
bit<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:06.030> struggle<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:09.780> backwards<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
bit of a struggle and then backwards and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.390 
bit of a struggle and then backwards and
forwards<00:04:10.739> at<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.980> end<00:04:12.860> let's<00:04:13.860> have<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.069> look<00:04:14.280> at
