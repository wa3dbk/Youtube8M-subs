00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello everybody, we are here again in the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
 tastes of the week to talk about beers 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
 special 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 This time I made a selection of some 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.400
 perfect European labeling for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400
 consumption now in summer 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.760
 our first beer is the traditional beer 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 hb a hofbrau coming directly from 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.700
 muni blonde as the pilsens she has 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 nice bitterness and it's enough 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.910
 refreshes very well with 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 light dishes such as salads from spain 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 I chose the star in the making 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.969
 this beer had the participation of the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.700
 renowned Spanish chef ferran adrià 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.129
 it is spicy citrus and also 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.060
 refreshingly perfect for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.180
 accompany seafood 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.600
 the English spirit beech is a tribute to 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.400
 aircraft used in World War II 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.190
 red as the English tradition 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.630
 she has outstanding bitterness and is perfect 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.850
 to accompany fries and snacks 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.970
 my next choice is beer 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.610
 Belgian delirium tremens known as the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.910
 pink elephant beer she is 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.280
 appreciated worldwide is more powerful 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.830
 but it does not stop being 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.260
 refreshing and tasty for summer 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.740
 It fits very well with cheeses like 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.350
 for example bill and gruyére and finally 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 one of my favorite beers 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.600
 to Belgian slippers those who like to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.240
 more full-bodied beers will find 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.729
 in this recipe caramelated notes and that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.670
 remember dried fruits and why not 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.500
 to harmonize with a dessert the result 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.500
 it is surprising and unusual 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.870
 I hope you enjoyed the beers 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.910
 that I presented when they were in the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.340
 supermarket look for a label 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.620
 different I'm sure some 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.350
 it will please your taste buds 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.350
