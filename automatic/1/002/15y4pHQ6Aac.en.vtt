00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
don't just give it all away which is a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.620 
don't just give it all away which is a
little<00:02:50.070> annoying<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.670> book<00:02:50.880> was<00:02:51.090> different

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630

obviously
what's<00:02:52.560> better<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:53.640> think<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.300> concept<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
what's better I think the concept of the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.320 
what's better I think the concept of the
movie<00:02:56.100> with<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> special<00:02:56.880> effects<00:02:57.150> were

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330

great<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.010> story<00:02:59.280> wise<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:02:59.850> I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
great so but the story wise I think I

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.250 
great so but the story wise I think I
stick<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> book<00:03:00.630> where<00:03:00.900> did<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.110> fall

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
