the cables came preassembled they are
they<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> ends<00:00:29.400> these<00:00:29.820> banana<00:00:30.810> plugs

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
they have at the ends these banana plugs

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.530 
they have at the ends these banana plugs
you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> price<00:00:32.669> tag<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.180> they

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
four that's for a one cable but we have

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
four that's for a one cable but we have
stereo<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.140> that's<00:00:40.710> why<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.070> need<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
stereo so that's why we need two of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.369 
stereo so that's why we need two of
those<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.760> since<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> since<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> cables

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
those but since that since the cables

let's take a look at one set of these

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.750 
let's take a look at one set of these
cables<00:02:10.710> okay<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:13.130> these<00:02:14.130> two

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
cables okay so as you can see these two

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.990 
cables okay so as you can see these two
plugs<00:02:15.120> each<00:02:15.390> plug<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.220> actually<00:02:17.220> made<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.580> two

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
plugs each plug is actually made of two

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.990 
plugs each plug is actually made of two
cables<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.720> go<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.130> spiral<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
cables they go like this in a spiral and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.860 
cables they go like this in a spiral and
it<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.110> supposed<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.970> help<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.180> quality<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it is supposed to help the quality of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.940 
it is supposed to help the quality of
the<00:02:25.860> sound<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.370> comes<00:02:27.140> through<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.470> speaker

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the sound that comes through the speaker

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.640 
the sound that comes through the speaker
when<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> use<00:02:29.520> these<00:02:29.790> cables<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.260> see

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
when you use these cables you can see

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.590 
when you use these cables you can see
that<00:02:32.030> these<00:02:33.030> are<00:02:33.360> banana<00:02:34.170> plugs<00:02:35.180> these<00:02:36.180> are

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that these are banana plugs these are

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.030 
that these are banana plugs these are
silver<00:02:36.960> but<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.220> come<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> gold
