p1<00:01:34.829> floaters<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.630> but<00:01:36.630> oh<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> reason<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
p1 floaters are but oh and the reason I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.200 
p1 floaters are but oh and the reason I
did<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:40.200> course<00:01:40.470> fracture<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.790> extra

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
did this is of course fracture for extra

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.770 
did this is of course fracture for extra
protection<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.950> also<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.780> more

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
protection let's also got this more

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.039 
protection let's also got this more
surface<00:01:46.350> area<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> put<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> Jersey<00:01:48.899> on

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
surface area so when you put a Jersey on

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990 
surface area so when you put a Jersey on
it's<00:01:49.439> gonna<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:50.189> gonna<00:01:50.250> look<00:01:50.549> bigger<00:01:50.820> in

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's gonna you're gonna look bigger in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.630 
it's gonna you're gonna look bigger in
net<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.170> stop<00:01:52.470> more<00:01:52.680> pucks<00:01:52.979> so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
net and it will stop more pucks so

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.690 
net and it will stop more pucks so
that's<00:01:54.030> great<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:55.740> another<00:01:56.040> mod<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> did

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that's great and then another mod I did

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.410 
that's great and then another mod I did
because<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.360> took<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.840> coho<00:01:58.909> heart<00:01:59.909> guard<00:02:00.240> out

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
because I took the coho heart guard out

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
because I took the coho heart guard out
and<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> under<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.610> p1<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> again

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and put it under the the p1 and again

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
and put it under the the p1 and again
just<00:02:05.909> stitched<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> elastic<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> I'd

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
