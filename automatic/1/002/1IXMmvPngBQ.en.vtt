inside the first thing to note about
this<00:00:54.840> motorcycle<00:00:55.110> battery<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.070> it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this motorcycle battery is that it's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.280 
this motorcycle battery is that it's
heavy<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.630> tightly<00:00:57.930> packed

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
heavy that's because it's tightly packed

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.319 
heavy that's because it's tightly packed
with<00:00:58.440> lead<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> lead<00:00:59.130> oxide<00:00:59.309> sheets<00:00:59.820> both<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with lead and lead oxide sheets both of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.200 
with lead and lead oxide sheets both of
which<00:01:00.450> are<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.660> dense<00:01:01.280> this<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> cell<00:01:02.820> from

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
which are very dense this is a cell from

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.719 
which are very dense this is a cell from
an<00:01:03.329> identical<00:01:03.870> battery<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
an identical battery and you can see the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.510 
an identical battery and you can see the
lead<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.600> underneath<00:01:07.109> this<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.920> lead<00:01:08.100> oxide

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
lead and underneath this the lead oxide

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
lead and underneath this the lead oxide
they<00:01:09.179> alternate<00:01:09.630> throughout<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> interior

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
they alternate throughout the interior

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.709 
they alternate throughout the interior
so<00:01:11.249> let<00:01:11.639> me<00:01:11.729> show<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.969> how<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.450> store

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
so let me show you how they store

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.920 
so let me show you how they store
electricity<00:01:13.079> using<00:01:13.709> just<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.429> plates

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.890 

so<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.710> have<00:01:18.220> here<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.700> lead<00:01:19.150> plate<00:01:19.480> and<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.750> let

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
so I have here a lead plate and a let

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.780 
so I have here a lead plate and a let
oxide<00:01:20.260> plate<00:01:20.530> from<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.770> battery<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
oxide plate from the battery and the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.940 
oxide plate from the battery and the
sulfuric<00:01:22.000> acid<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.780> now<00:01:23.110> watch<00:01:23.350> what<00:01:23.560> happens

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
sulfuric acid and now watch what happens

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.810 
sulfuric acid and now watch what happens
when<00:01:24.220> I<00:01:24.310> connect<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.790> leads<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:27.160> LED<00:01:27.550> lights

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
when I connect the leads the LED lights

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.360 
when I connect the leads the LED lights
up<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.390> current<00:01:29.170> flows<00:01:29.380> from<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> lead<00:01:29.890> oxide

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
up a current flows from the lead oxide

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.580 
up a current flows from the lead oxide
cathode<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.150> lead<00:01:31.330> anode<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:32.080> lead<00:01:32.290> gives

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
cathode to the lead anode the lead gives

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.740 
cathode to the lead anode the lead gives
up<00:01:32.710> electrons<00:01:32.830> with<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.460> lead<00:01:33.790> oxide<00:01:34.210> accepts

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
up electrons with the lead oxide accepts

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.080 
up electrons with the lead oxide accepts
this<00:01:35.380> exchange<00:01:35.620> turns<00:01:36.160> both<00:01:36.370> plates<00:01:36.700> into

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
this exchange turns both plates into

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.690 
this exchange turns both plates into
solid<00:01:37.570> lead<00:01:37.900> sulfate<00:01:38.470> now<00:01:39.100> let<00:01:39.430> me<00:01:39.520> measure

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
solid lead sulfate now let me measure

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.980 
solid lead sulfate now let me measure
the<00:01:39.910> voltage<00:01:40.210> difference<00:01:40.390> between<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.840> two

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
the voltage difference between the two

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.570 
the voltage difference between the two
leads<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:44.440> can<00:01:44.590> see<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:45.160> about<00:01:45.220> 2

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
leads and you can see that it's about 2

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.740 
leads and you can see that it's about 2
volts<00:01:45.940> which<00:01:46.150> means<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.820> make<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.330> 12

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
volts which means that to make this 12

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.420 
volts which means that to make this 12
volt<00:01:49.960> battery<00:01:50.260> 6<00:01:50.590> cells<00:01:50.890> are<00:01:51.100> linked<00:01:51.369> in

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
volt battery 6 cells are linked in

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.640 
volt battery 6 cells are linked in
series<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.970> make<00:01:52.119> up<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.330> 12<00:01:52.570> volts<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:53.470> that's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
series to make up to 12 volts so that's

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.040 
series to make up to 12 volts so that's
the<00:01:53.830> basic<00:01:54.310> electrochemical<00:01:55.180> reaction<00:01:55.570> now

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
the basic electrochemical reaction now

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.750 
the basic electrochemical reaction now
let's<00:01:56.320> look<00:01:56.440> at<00:01:56.560> how<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.710> engineer<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.400> battery

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
let's look at how you engineer a battery

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.700 
let's look at how you engineer a battery
we<00:01:58.300> want<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.510> battery<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.990> have<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.200> high<00:01:59.500> density

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
we want a battery to have a high density
