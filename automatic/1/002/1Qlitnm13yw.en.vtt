00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.250 
took the motor off sprayed the motor
sprayed<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> front<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.630> back<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.990> motor

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
sprayed the front and back of the motor

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.380 
sprayed the front and back of the motor
I<00:02:10.560> didn't<00:02:11.040> spray<00:02:11.280> any<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.820> stuff<00:02:12.090> here

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
I didn't spray any of this stuff here

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570 
I didn't spray any of this stuff here
maybe<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> next<00:02:13.170> car<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.620> will<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.460> it

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
maybe on the next car I will but it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.340 
maybe on the next car I will but it
seems<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.060> staying<00:02:15.330> pretty<00:02:15.630> clean<00:02:15.990> after

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
seems to be staying pretty clean after

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.570 
seems to be staying pretty clean after
we're<00:02:16.470> playing<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> water<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> mud

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
we're playing in the water in the mud

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.900 
we're playing in the water in the mud
but<00:02:18.390> anyway<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.320> we<00:02:19.440> did<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.920> after<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.760> did

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
but anyway what we did is after we did

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.900 
but anyway what we did is after we did
this<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> first<00:02:21.630> video<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.700> can

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this on the first video and you can

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120 
this on the first video and you can
still<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.630> top<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.200> perfectly

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
still see that the top is perfectly

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.620 
still see that the top is perfectly
clean<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> day<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.060> took<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.360> out<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
clean like the day we took it out of the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.200 
clean like the day we took it out of the
box<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.070> been<00:02:29.250> through<00:02:29.460> every<00:02:29.730> mud<00:02:29.970> and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
box and it's been through every mud and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.870 
box and it's been through every mud and
water<00:02:30.390> hole<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.810> could<00:02:30.990> put<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.290> through

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
water hole we could put it through

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.720 
water hole we could put it through
doesn't<00:02:32.880> repel<00:02:33.120> grass<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.750> anyway<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> we

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
doesn't repel grass but anyway so we

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.220 
doesn't repel grass but anyway so we
thought<00:02:36.000> we'd<00:02:36.180> take<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.720> step<00:02:36.959> further

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
thought we'd take it one step further

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.010 
thought we'd take it one step further
and<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:38.640> you're<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.180> playing<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> rain

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
and if you're out playing in the rain

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.300 
and if you're out playing in the rain
with<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.620> car<00:02:41.209> what<00:02:42.209> about<00:02:42.450> your<00:02:42.660> radio<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:44.130> we

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
with the car what about your radio so we

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.699 
with the car what about your radio so we
took<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.670> one<00:02:44.790> step<00:02:45.060> further<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.440> pulled

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
took it one step further and I pulled

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.130 
took it one step further and I pulled
this<00:02:46.890> thing<00:02:46.950> apart<00:02:47.750> wasn't<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> funnest

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
this thing apart wasn't the funnest

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.630 
this thing apart wasn't the funnest
thing<00:02:49.320> in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> world<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.370> doable

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
thing in the world to do but it's doable

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.449 
thing in the world to do but it's doable
so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> pulled<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.570> apart<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.950> sprayed<00:02:53.310> all

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
so I pulled it apart and I sprayed all

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.880 
so I pulled it apart and I sprayed all
the<00:02:53.580> components<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.360> radio<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.440> think

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the components in this radio so I think

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.100 
the components in this radio so I think
you<00:02:56.610> guys<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.820> be<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> first<00:02:57.360> ones<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:58.080> it

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
you guys can be the first ones to see it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.960 
you guys can be the first ones to see it
I'm<00:02:58.709> gonna<00:02:58.890> put<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.250> water<00:02:59.430> over<00:02:59.730> here<00:02:59.880> in
