00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.710
 Hello, the test there, just a personal touch. 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.469
 today and tomorrow I will start over 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 Praising your tennis on the face is very cool. 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:26.699
 But look, this is what's cool is what's on 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:30.210
 inside the beautiful time, people 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.309
 I also liked it softly 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 who want good link back today 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:46.530
 I'm going to teach you the great demand 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:55.199
 is great and you need to know first 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 everything that is different you will have to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.620
 let him controlling here so you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.890
 will have to weigh with the foot 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 You'll have to think with them so the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.770
 run 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 he will run with the tank and when 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.360
 you 're starting he's going to run 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.850
 like this, but when you have already 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 more bases and will be able to send him 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 controlling and I'll explain the two 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.140
 ways how will you do to send 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.750
 to send you the easiest way you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.040
 just gonna come straight with the crate you go 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.810
 in a distance that you find more 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.090
 comfortable because each one has a way 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.430
 to play the skateboard over the dog 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.189
 so when you hit with your foot 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.340
 almost on the screw like that there when 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.270
 you hit you will play your foot 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 Front you're dragging you will 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.689
 support the weight on the front foot you go 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.850
 stop running and if you stand behind you 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.479
 will have to get up at the time that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.159
 will have to raise that foot in the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.479
 time that fit you see you 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.850
 managed to weigh 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.819
 you leave is get up if you hold on 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.910
 in the beginning it will be difficult but it's just you 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.540
 make sure with that foot 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:20.090
 and if you relieve the weight well then you will 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.240
 and in the end it 's kind of difficult because 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.640
 How heavy are you with disgust? 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.510
 it will kind of give me indicated to 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.030
 low 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.910
 So you're going to have to arrest him here. 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.830
 And you're going to push me. 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.300
 only at the beginning when you are 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.920
 taking this maneuver 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.220
 the moment you will push the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.980
 Sometimes you hit like that, because if you do not 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.210
 is accustomed to push yes then 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.670
 You 're going to do this to me here so it 's a 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.040
 more training rather than technical 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.880
 You have to train a lot. 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.620
 to be able to push and leave without touching 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.350
 in the back in the crate 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.110
 one tip I give is to spend a lot 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.210
 candle in the crate because when it caught 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.950
 It's kind of bad because you are 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.390
 with all the weight in front then when 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.240
 he grabs you fly 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.950
 so you have to spend a lot of candle 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.660
 to be able to slide the dog must 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.300
 always be revealed because if not you 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.260
 will grab and not get 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.260
 so coming back 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.800
 You'll almost leave your foot on us. 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.170
 screws appeared on the body in the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.360
 time you go into the crate and has 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.870
 thinks about dragging him to the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.240
 front and you will lift the test brings 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.790
 The back foot you're going to have to let him 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.320
 well lifted 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.830
 then you will run leaving the foot of the 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.620
 front with weight and rear raised and 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.069
 the moment you reach the end of the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.249
 Front you're going to push him 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.060
 and the back foot you're going to go down 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.249
 Light 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.609
 sometimes you can push but he 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:07.189
 out kind of like that without pushing and it falls 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.260
 with our first up because you do not 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.180
 straightened with the back foot so you have 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.939
 Put your right foot in when you 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.099
 pushes you play in front and back and 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.989
 It's kind of low for him to be upset that 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.430
 it will come out much more beautiful than the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.829
 another way you're going to have to balance 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.820
 skateboard how are you going to do that in the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.710
 moment you play on izraa expede 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.430
 behind you do not lift it up 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.530
 You will support with this and that you will 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.180
 also support those you will see that 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.620
 control it here as if it were a 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.320
 manual 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.199
 so when you play and if you 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.880
 supports compete brings here that you can 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.349
 be strength with him but if you 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.570
 support your pet behind 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.280
 He will not be with us here, will you? 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.130
 able to control our large 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.470
 It's even easier when it's time to push. 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.500
 It will work out much better because like him 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.699
 this is the time to give a pop 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.680
 what a crate 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.940
 So, when you leave, you 'll be able to get there. 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.099
 hit a name 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.380
 This is going to work out a lot more beautiful. 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.449
 a more beautiful new one and if it will leave a 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.070
 Way more beautiful when you 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.840
 you are in the middle of the maneuver, your 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.300
 test your shoulder will have marriage in 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.259
 parallel with your foot for it is not 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.380
 far behind and it falls or is very 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.300
 front of the bottle so it's kind that is you 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.759
 makes a line like that to your shoulder with the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:36.740
 your leg and your foot then your 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:40.930
 weight then your weight has to be everything 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:45.770
 aligned in the purvin snippet then I followed 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.330
 then your weight has to be all then I 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.560
 I think everything is aligned on the three 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.120
 front so you will you will step on and 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.500
 yours and your weight will be as it were 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.590
 a line so 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.140
 only if you have the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.980
 your foot will not be so young so he 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.410
 There will be more here from your back foot. 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.380
 will be forcing magic then it will be 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.730
 means that there is a means entered the eleven 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.060
 for rifle 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.500
 There you will run if you are sent 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.290
 another way you can step on any 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.900
 place 12 you will only force him to 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.910
 low and will run normal 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.290
 now I'll send the maneuver and see in 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.720
 slow motion this is very important 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.180
 for you to see the movement of the foot in the hour 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.650
 that lies on the crate how do 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.730
 It's good to see the images for you to get 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.730
 get a new one better 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.350
 so I hope you have enjoyed the
