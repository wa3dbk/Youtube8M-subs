00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
so I got a little update on why this is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.000 
so I got a little update on why this is
likely<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.880> female<00:00:12.510> there<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> lot<00:00:13.620> more<00:00:13.680> to

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
likely a female there was a lot more to

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.430 
likely a female there was a lot more to
it<00:00:14.130> than<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:15.049> because<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.320> unusual

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it than that because of the unusual

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.279 
it than that because of the unusual
flukes<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.630> some<00:00:18.630> photo<00:00:18.869> identification

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
flukes and some photo identification

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250 
flukes and some photo identification
some<00:00:20.070> photo<00:00:20.280> was<00:00:20.460> taken

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.500 

some<00:00:23.920> of<00:00:24.040> the<00:00:24.100> local<00:00:24.460> captains<00:00:24.910> are<00:00:25.060> sure<00:00:25.270> that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
some of the local captains are sure that

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.180 
some of the local captains are sure that
this<00:00:25.660> is<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:25.960> whale<00:00:26.110> that<00:00:26.350> had<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.530> calf<00:00:26.890> with

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
this is the whale that had a calf with

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.320 
this is the whale that had a calf with
it<00:00:27.340> last<00:00:27.580> year<00:00:29.100> so<00:00:30.100> that<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.700> is<00:00:30.910> why<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:31.119> do

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
it last year so that that is why I do

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.320 
it last year so that that is why I do
say<00:00:31.570> I<00:00:31.720> didn't<00:00:31.990> know<00:00:32.050> that<00:00:32.080> part<00:00:32.290> of<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.680> story

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
say I didn't know that part of the story

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.360 
say I didn't know that part of the story
photo<00:00:34.330> identification<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:35.230> animals<00:00:35.650> is<00:00:35.950> very

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
photo identification of animals is very

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.640 
photo identification of animals is very
useful<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:37.059> lot<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.420> animals<00:00:37.720> it's<00:00:38.260> impractical

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
useful a lot of animals it's impractical

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.970 
useful a lot of animals it's impractical
to<00:00:39.040> tag<00:00:39.960> dolphins<00:00:40.960> humpback<00:00:41.379> whales<00:00:41.650> blue

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
to tag dolphins humpback whales blue

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.540 
to tag dolphins humpback whales blue
whales<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.910> we<00:00:43.090> rely<00:00:43.570> on<00:00:43.870> stars<00:00:44.550> another

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
whales so we rely on stars another

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.610 
whales so we rely on stars another
physical<00:00:46.030> characteristics<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.230> life<00:00:47.410> of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
physical characteristics of the life of

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.220 
physical characteristics of the life of
the<00:00:47.710> animal<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:49.330> one<00:00:49.510> has<00:00:49.720> such<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:50.199> unique

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
the animal this one has such a unique

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
the animal this one has such a unique
tale<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:52.570> has<00:00:52.750> become<00:00:53.080> its<00:00:53.290> locals

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
tale that has become its locals

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.320 
tale that has become its locals
uppercase<00:00:56.220> so<00:00:57.220> apparently<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.089> whale

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
uppercase so apparently this is a whale

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.180 
uppercase so apparently this is a whale
or<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.570> whale<00:00:58.839> very<00:00:59.320> much<00:00:59.589> like<00:00:59.830> it<00:01:00.010> with

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
or a whale very much like it with

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:18.950 
or a whale very much like it with
upturned<00:01:00.970> flukes<00:01:01.390> had<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.140> baby<00:01:02.440> master

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
down on that main deck though all

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.690 
down on that main deck though all
students<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.830> look<00:01:24.010> around<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.580> their

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
students can look around this is their

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.150 
students can look around this is their
last<00:01:24.910> time<00:01:25.180> she's<00:01:25.510> due<00:01:25.630> up<00:01:25.780> soon<00:01:26.230> yeah<00:01:26.500> it

last time she's due up soon yeah it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.740 
last time she's due up soon yeah it
might<00:01:27.310> be<00:01:27.460> even<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.730> little<00:01:27.760> easier<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.390> see<00:01:28.510> her

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
might be even a little easier to see her

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.270 
might be even a little easier to see her
this<00:01:28.870> time<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.200> Sun<00:01:29.470> has<00:01:29.650> broken<00:01:29.920> through<00:01:30.190> in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
this time the Sun has broken through in

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.970 
this time the Sun has broken through in
the<00:01:30.430> last<00:01:30.490> 10<00:01:30.850> minutes<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:31.270> tiny<00:01:31.480> bit<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.800> when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
the last 10 minutes a tiny bit so when

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.220 
the last 10 minutes a tiny bit so when
she<00:01:33.130> exhales<00:01:33.610> her<00:01:34.000> miss<00:01:34.270> might<00:01:34.600> actually<00:01:34.810> get

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
she exhales her miss might actually get

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.950 
she exhales her miss might actually get
some<00:01:35.560> light<00:01:36.150> she's<00:01:37.150> pretty<00:01:37.390> hard<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.780> see

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
some light she's pretty hard to see

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.060 
some light she's pretty hard to see
otherwise<00:01:38.229> in<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.250> flat<00:01:39.490> light<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.229> let's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
otherwise in the flat light so let's

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.650 
otherwise in the flat light so let's
hope<00:01:42.220> she<00:01:42.370> didn't<00:01:42.610> keep<00:01:42.700> swimming<00:01:43.210> we're

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
hope she didn't keep swimming we're

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.930 
hope she didn't keep swimming we're
actually<00:01:43.810> down<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.290> little<00:01:44.560> past<00:01:44.920> where<00:01:45.550> we<00:01:45.729> saw

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
actually down a little past where we saw

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.330 
actually down a little past where we saw
her<00:01:46.150> I'm<00:01:47.080> assuming<00:01:47.560> she<00:01:47.710> might<00:01:47.890> keep<00:01:48.130> paddling

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
her I'm assuming she might keep paddling

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.570 
her I'm assuming she might keep paddling
downhill<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.270> little<00:01:50.020> bit<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:51.310> kind<00:01:51.520> of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
downhill a little bit so we kind of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.680 
downhill a little bit so we kind of
overshot<00:01:52.030> where<00:01:52.240> she<00:01:52.450> was<00:01:53.550> on<00:01:54.550> that<00:01:54.790> distant

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
overshot where she was on that distant

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.930 
overshot where she was on that distant
