some<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.220> may<00:00:05.790> have<00:00:05.819> seen<00:00:06.150> videos<00:00:06.810> that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
some of you may have seen videos that

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.780 
some of you may have seen videos that
are<00:00:07.849> circulating<00:00:08.849> around<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.210> net<00:00:10.790> claiming

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
are circulating around the net claiming

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.230 
are circulating around the net claiming
that<00:00:13.190> these<00:00:14.190> big<00:00:16.520> Lantern<00:00:17.520> batteries<00:00:17.820> I'm

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
that these big Lantern batteries I'm

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.760 
that these big Lantern batteries I'm
trying<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> voltage<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
trying to see what the voltage is on it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.550 
trying to see what the voltage is on it
six<00:00:20.760> volt<00:00:22.220> that<00:00:23.220> actually<00:00:23.699> what's<00:00:23.910> inside

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
six volt that actually what's inside

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.480 
six volt that actually what's inside
well<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.920> more<00:00:26.849> batteries<00:00:27.830> like<00:00:28.830> most<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.400> us

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
well is more batteries like most of us

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.669 
well is more batteries like most of us
have<00:00:29.640> always<00:00:29.760> assumed<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> inside<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.320> big

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
have always assumed the inside is a big

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.889 
have always assumed the inside is a big
chamber<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.430> acid<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.210> burn<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
chamber of acid that will burn you and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.620 
chamber of acid that will burn you and
hurt<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> open<00:00:35.370> them<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.880> most

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hurt you if you open them up so most

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.720 
hurt you if you open them up so most
people<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:36.899> ever<00:00:37.290> open<00:00:37.559> them<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.550> also

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
people don't ever open them up and also

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.420 
people don't ever open them up and also
the<00:00:39.059> smaller<00:00:39.920> little<00:00:40.920> voltage<00:00:41.820> batteries

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
the smaller little voltage batteries

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.770 
the smaller little voltage batteries
they<00:00:44.430> seem<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.149> contain<00:00:45.930> batteries<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.129> well

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
they seem to contain batteries as well

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
they seem to contain batteries as well
of<00:00:48.780> various<00:00:49.200> kinds<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.309> later

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of various kinds get into that later

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
of various kinds get into that later
but<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.270> been<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.719> dying<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but I've been just dying to get one of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
but I've been just dying to get one of
these<00:00:53.129> big<00:00:53.370> ones<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> open<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:55.079> if

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
these big ones and open it up and see if

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
these big ones and open it up and see if
it<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.800> does<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.340> double-a<00:00:57.030> batteries

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it really does have double-a batteries

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.310 
it really does have double-a batteries
inside<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:59.390> according<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> most<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
inside and according to most of the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
inside and according to most of the
videos<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.129> does<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> still<00:01:02.760> feel

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
videos it really does but I still feel

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.780 
videos it really does but I still feel
like<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.239> being<00:01:03.629> tricked<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.369> gonna<00:01:05.489> see

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
like I'm being tricked so I'm gonna see

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.440 
like I'm being tricked so I'm gonna see
for<00:01:05.939> myself

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
for myself

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 
for myself
and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> tell<00:01:08.400> but

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and I don't know if you can tell but

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 
and I don't know if you can tell but
this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.180> shrink<00:01:09.720> wrap<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.460> fresh<00:01:11.460> from

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this is a shrink wrap on it fresh from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
this is a shrink wrap on it fresh from
the<00:01:11.820> store<00:01:12.090> I'll<00:01:12.270> shrink<00:01:12.600> wrapped<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the store I'll shrink wrapped up so you

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
the store I'll shrink wrapped up so you
know<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> haven't<00:01:14.369> tampered<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:25.970> now<00:01:26.970> they

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
know I haven't tampered with it now they

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.050 
know I haven't tampered with it now they
say<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.659> need<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.409> remove<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.520> label

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
say that you need to remove the label

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
say that you need to remove the label
let's<00:01:33.180> see<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.630> find<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> same<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
let's see if I can find the same and it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.730 
let's see if I can find the same and it
you're<00:01:50.670> supposed<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> pry<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> top<00:01:52.320> off<00:01:52.649> with

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
you're supposed to pry the top off with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're supposed to pry the top off with
with<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.009> screwdriver<00:01:56.780> I'm<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.990> sure<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.290> do

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
with a screwdriver I'm not sure I can do

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.889 
with a screwdriver I'm not sure I can do
this<00:01:58.770> part

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.309 

I<00:02:09.909> think<00:02:10.909> that<00:02:11.060> desperate<00:02:11.540> times<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:12.230> about

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
I think that desperate times are about

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.080 
I think that desperate times are about
to<00:02:12.620> call<00:02:12.829> for<00:02:13.069> desperate<00:02:13.189> measures

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.759 

okay<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.329> just<00:02:17.420> stabbed<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
okay I just stabbed it with the

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.740 
okay I just stabbed it with the
screwdriver<00:02:19.340> because<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.970> can't<00:02:20.239> find<00:02:20.480> my

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
screwdriver because I can't find my

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:31.300 
screwdriver because I can't find my
knife<00:02:21.879> same<00:02:22.879> battery<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.319> just<00:02:30.650> got<00:02:30.829> violent

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
knife same battery so I just got violent

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:46.290 
knife same battery so I just got violent
with<00:02:31.430> it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.940 

I<00:02:46.360> think<00:02:47.140> I'm<00:02:47.260> about<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.710> very

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
I think I'm about to be very

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.410 
I think I'm about to be very
disappointed<00:02:50.400> because<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.610> does<00:02:51.850> not<00:02:52.120> look

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
disappointed because it does not look

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:08.400 
disappointed because it does not look
like<00:02:52.450> double<00:02:53.020> a's<00:02:53.200> in<00:02:53.530> here<00:02:53.890> no<00:03:07.230> maybe<00:03:08.230> it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
like double a's in here no maybe it

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.320 
like double a's in here no maybe it
varies<00:03:08.770> from<00:03:08.950> brand<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.400> brand<00:03:09.460> this<00:03:09.940> isn't

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
varies from brand to brand this isn't

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.810 
varies from brand to brand this isn't
ever<00:03:10.450> ready<00:03:11.040> yeah<00:03:12.040> there's<00:03:12.310> great<00:03:12.460> there's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
like great big ones that I could never

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.970 
like great big ones that I could never
use<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.770> anything<00:03:15.010> else<00:03:18.990> then<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.080> stabbed<00:03:20.590> one

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
use it anything else then I stabbed one

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.570 
use it anything else then I stabbed one
of<00:03:21.130> them<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:23.290> smells<00:03:23.710> funny<00:03:24.010> yeah<00:03:24.340> they're

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
of them it smells funny yeah they're

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.890 
of them it smells funny yeah they're
they're<00:03:24.850> great<00:03:25.090> big<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.480> don't<00:03:25.540> know<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.810> you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
they're great big I don't know if you

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.070 
they're great big I don't know if you
can<00:03:26.080> even<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:26.350> but<00:03:27.210> let<00:03:28.210> me<00:03:28.300> finish<00:03:28.450> cracking

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
can even see but let me finish cracking

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.930 
can even see but let me finish cracking
it<00:03:29.200> open<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.830> think<00:03:36.100> it's<00:03:36.310> clear<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.730> say
