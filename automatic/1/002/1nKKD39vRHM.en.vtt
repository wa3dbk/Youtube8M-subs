00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello guys this is the video of 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.160
 demonstration of the procedure that 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.769
 we described then first 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.139
 it is done on transfers to look for or 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.210
 alvarez or crazy 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.210
 in this case we will try alvarez 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.800
 minimum auction price 10,000 credits 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.580
 and price now buys 15,000 credits 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.250
 here is how you can see there are these 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:03.930
 here assistance force 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:08.930
 we are going to buy one at random at al 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.930
 buy now with 15 thousand credits 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.030
 ok now we have nothing left except 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.869
 send to the transfer list on 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.869
 our alvarez 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.670
 then exit from the last team e 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.670
 come back at least main 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.590
 because now we wait a few seconds 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.590
 before returning to the last teams 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.970

 transfers to see who is there at 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.909
 place of alvarez 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:51.700

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.549
 however not indifferent and nothing all
