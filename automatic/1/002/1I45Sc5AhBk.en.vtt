releasing a disc isn't really in letting
go<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.670> more<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.599> grip<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.139> disc

go it's more in how you grip the disc
there's<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.340> couple<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.759> different<00:00:15.089> ways<00:00:15.179> that

I<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:15.660> people<00:00:15.960> gripping<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.470> disc<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
I see people gripping a disc the

I see people gripping a disc the
traditional<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.210> would<00:00:18.359> grip<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
traditional way that you would grip a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.170 
traditional way that you would grip a
frisbee<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.609> hand<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.029> know<00:00:21.060> on

frisbee is with your hand you know on
the<00:00:21.270> bottom<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.720> probably<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> leading<00:00:22.590> finger

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the bottom and probably a leading finger

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.730 
the bottom and probably a leading finger
that<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:24.180> usually<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> best<00:00:25.199> way<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> get

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that is not usually the best way to get

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
that is not usually the best way to get
the<00:00:25.890> most<00:00:26.070> distance<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.849> disc<00:00:27.090> when

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the most distance out of a disc when

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.029 
the most distance out of a disc when
you're<00:00:27.420> playing<00:00:27.630> disc<00:00:27.900> golf<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
you're playing disc golf on you have a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.250 
you're playing disc golf on you have a
driver<00:00:29.460> having<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:30.300> finger<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.929> leading

driver having your finger on the leading

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
driver having your finger on the leading
edge<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.619> probably<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
edge is probably not going to get you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.000 
edge is probably not going to get you
very<00:00:33.930> far<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> give<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
very far it is going to give you a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.380 
very far it is going to give you a
little<00:00:35.190> more<00:00:35.309> control<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.149> gonna

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
little more control but it's not gonna

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
little more control but it's not gonna
get<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> distance<00:00:37.079> most<00:00:37.680> players<00:00:38.040> are

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
get you the distance most players are

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
get you the distance most players are
gonna<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.210> will<00:00:39.360> call<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> power<00:00:39.989> grip

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
gonna use what we will call a power grip

you don't ever let go and your disc ends
up<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.370> off<00:00:59.670> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> bushes<00:01:00.510> somewhere<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
up off off in the bushes somewhere so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
up off off in the bushes somewhere so
you<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> nice<00:01:02.160> tight<00:01:02.460> grip<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you do want to have a nice tight grip to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
you do want to have a nice tight grip to
where<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> come<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
where it's not going to come out and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
where it's not going to come out and
think<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.339> holding<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.820> grip<00:01:06.090> tight<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
think about holding that grip tight that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.899 
think about holding that grip tight that
as<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.409> momentum<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> dis<00:01:08.250> moves<00:01:08.490> forward

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
as the momentum of the dis moves forward

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
as the momentum of the dis moves forward
it<00:01:09.030> will<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.450> pulled<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.409> hand

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it will get pulled out of your hand

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
it will get pulled out of your hand
naturally<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.670> hold<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.270> nice<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
naturally so hold on to it nice and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.109 
naturally so hold on to it nice and
tight<00:01:12.810> usually<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> power<00:01:13.920> grip<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
tight usually in a power grip and as you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.810 
tight usually in a power grip and as you
release<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.200> disc<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> disc<00:01:17.220> reaches<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
release the disc as the disc reaches the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840 
release the disc as the disc reaches the
end<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.659> arm<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.740> rip<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.280> normally

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
end of your arm it will rip out normally

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.820 
end of your arm it will rip out normally
when<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.080> time<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> putt<00:01:22.650> you're

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
when you when it's time to putt you're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
when you when it's time to putt you're
probably<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:23.520> more<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> control

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
probably gonna use more of a control

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.450 
probably gonna use more of a control
grip<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.530> holding<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:25.950> disc<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.400> a
