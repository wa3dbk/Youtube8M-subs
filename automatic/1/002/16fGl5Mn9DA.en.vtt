00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
that's a pretty solid jack from what I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.860 
that's a pretty solid jack from what I
can<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:29.689> take<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> look<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.009> see

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
can see take a look there you can see

how<00:00:33.870> low<00:00:34.140> profile<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.950> would<00:00:35.219> work<00:00:35.460> fine<00:00:35.730> with

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
how low profile is would work fine with

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.459 
how low profile is would work fine with
no<00:00:37.559> cars<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.190> lowered<00:00:39.140> my<00:00:40.140> car's<00:00:40.379> not

no cars that are lowered my car's not
lowered<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.550> didn't<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> test

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
lowered so I didn't really get to test

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
lowered so I didn't really get to test
that<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:44.809> it<00:00:45.809> looks<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.530> wouldn't

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that but it looks like it wouldn't

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
that but it looks like it wouldn't
really<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.129> problem<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.670> something

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
