00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and see how much better you've gotten at

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.540 
and see how much better you've gotten at
drawing<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> time<00:00:52.250> it's<00:00:53.250> really

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
drawing through the time it's really

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
drawing through the time it's really
hard<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> keep<00:00:54.000> track<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.570> sort<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> thing

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
hard to keep track of that sort of thing

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.569 
hard to keep track of that sort of thing
I<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:57.649> artists<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
I think just because as artists a lot of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
I think just because as artists a lot of
times<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.969> only<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.930> flaws<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> what

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
times we only see the flaws of what

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
times we only see the flaws of what
we're<00:01:01.859> creating<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.910> don't<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.390> much

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
we're creating and we don't see how much

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.289 
we're creating and we don't see how much
we're<00:01:03.719> growing<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.580> hard<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> keep

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
we're growing it's very hard to keep

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.260 
we're growing it's very hard to keep
track<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> looking<00:01:08.850> at

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
track of so going back and looking at

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.929 
track of so going back and looking at
these<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.470> same<00:01:10.680> characters<00:01:11.130> over<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.640> over

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
these the same characters over and over

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.960 
these the same characters over and over
I<00:01:12.470> feel<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.790> great

I feel like that's something that's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.390 
I feel like that's something that's
really<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:22.290> cool<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.890> creating<00:01:23.250> web

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
really really cool about creating web

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.350 
really really cool about creating web
comics<00:01:24.799> number<00:01:25.799> two<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.000> those

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
comics number two you know all those

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
comics number two you know all those
silly<00:01:27.659> jokes<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> puns<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
silly jokes and puns you think of you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.510 
silly jokes and puns you think of you
could<00:01:30.030> immortalize<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.079> comic<00:01:31.740> form<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
could immortalize them in comic form and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.350 
could immortalize them in comic form and
I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.390> unreasonable<00:01:34.939> if<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.180> have

a lot of funny ideas constantly and just

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.260 
a lot of funny ideas constantly and just
don't<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> express<00:01:39.600> them<00:01:41.270> number
