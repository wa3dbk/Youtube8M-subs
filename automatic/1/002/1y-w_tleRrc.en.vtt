00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.139
 hi to all the themes of space games 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.840
 I'm Dr. Weitz and we're here today with 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.480
 a new video of fifa 15 useful team 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.180
 forgive my voice or a little bit of 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.360
 influence however since there are teams 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.920
 of the year since I could try 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.019
 last year decided to bring me 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.810
 immediately the review because it is a 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.760
 player that I loved very much 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.230
 it was quite obvious that it would end in 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.880
 team of the year and I obviously have 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.710
 I hadn't put prediction, I was 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.600
 forgot about him also because I had 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
 inserted I don't remember if robben o 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.710
 miller in midfield lost placed in 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.659
 attack and then a place will be released 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.960
 place that has been busy as you know 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.390
 from cross to flank to invest a little 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 surprise and maria as it was instead 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.540
 a bit obvious 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.489
 just the German I got to 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 try always thank reader in cars 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.360
 italy for the great opportunity that i have 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.430
 has granted player with excellent 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.720
 statistics because all the teams of the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 year latest statistics 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.640
 let's see how it behaves in the field 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.670
 starting as usual with speed 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.310
 speed that is not bad for the player 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.650
 68 indicated on the card it translates into 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.360
 74 1 an acceleration of important 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.820
 the asp rinspeed which is rather rather 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.620
 low with 63 I say acceleration 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.150
 quite important because cross is not 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.220
 a player we need to exploit for 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.860
 making long and short is more a player 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.200
 perhaps for a short distance then 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.610
 a burning acceleration to jump 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.800
 the man who comes to us from even you can 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.540
 then unload the ball for that 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.360
 that serves us cross for the role that 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.030
 it covers the acceleration 74 a lot 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.490
 important to point out 84 of strength 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.710
 physical that joined to the 82 m of height but 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.480
 trust me in the field it seems even higher 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.720
 looks bigger when we go 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.580
 to play in the games is 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.110
 particularly useful to allow us to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.000
 also wins some physical confrontation or 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.100
 also recover the ball in defense 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.920
 thanks to our video so maybe 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.600
 when I meet an outsider not 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.810
 particularly physically strong as 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.090
 neymar with hazard all 84 and physical strength 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.810
 we manage to steal the ball of course if 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.700
 we don't start it 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.099
 the k opened that case we don't recover it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.620
 now with regards to shooting a lot 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.319
 very good we start with a statistic 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.550
 important the 5-star weak foot thing 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.239
 it means having five foot stars 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.620
 weak 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.750
 it means that we can pull both of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.519
 right or left quietly 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.860
 there is none very different e 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.010
 this leads the defense to have problems 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.380
 because usually like for example a 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.849
 robben the defense will try to bring you 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.860
 on the right foot than your foot 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.620
 weak with cross do not have this 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 therefore be careful if away with 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.970
 self met cross do not let go to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.310
 however, left is not punishing you in 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.470
 plus it has an excellent finalization for a 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.980
 central midfielder 85 who is not 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.110
 not bad at long road 99 even if not 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.780
 I never managed to mark it for mistakes 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.610
 my three one including crosses with cross 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.290
 however you looked at him lokron is not bad 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.799
 he asked about shooting power 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.420
 I would close talking about the excellent penalties 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.410
 rigorist so if you need a 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.030
 take a cross and I would tell you the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.070
 punishment cleaners you know that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.329
 surely on this film ago have been 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.070
 simplified 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.799
 I was not much, however, now 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.450
 spallette will bring you a tutorial and if 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.640
 look for one to pull them polizzi holy 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.590
 cross is right for you 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.640
 one hundred because on the positions is one 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.480
 sentence every goal punishment really 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.670
 amazing a fantastic player 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.170
 best probably shooters of 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.700
 police them the game I could 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.890
 try so far i've tried so many 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.180
 trust players in regards to 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.650
 step 97 then nearly 97 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.829
 March value of passage and stretch 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.750
 all because at 99 short pass 98 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.299
 passing along then another 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.079
 exceptional value so if you have 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.239
 need 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.340
 a midfielder you can pull can 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.889
 pass kroos and your case 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.840
 probably the best passer by 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.250
 play together with ines a team of the year 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.590
 that he too is not bad at all 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.170
 dribbling dribbling we start from the side 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.209
 slightly negative are the skills 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.650
 they are three star ski so not at the top 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.959
 as for the dribbling for the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.840
 rest is excellent ball control 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.819
 web agility so you can too 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.250
 dribble with this player close 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.870
 here is the defense and able to tell between 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.190
 defense that you know the recommended then 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.370
 for this player 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.080
 I would tell you to use the basic kers 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 because cross sincerely is not that 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.370
 need much because it is the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.800
 base strip 68 and speed and the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.720
 defense that are excellent stat 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.940
 or if they really want to improve e 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.520
 own speed and defense of that case 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.110
 shadow then maybe a little boost 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.880
 to these statistics 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.500
 I have to use this average player 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.120
 video work so it's always in place 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.530
 just at the right time note will have to 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.970
 kessick, however, shows up in attack 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.130
 you saw that I also made goals 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.200
 of insertion and defense is a lot 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.850
 smart because when saliva mode 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.340
 hedgehogs for having team down he went down 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.310
 so he never leaves the discovery 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.440
 team so where to use it is the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.570
 dance so easy to hybridize into 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.010
 this case is inside a bundesliga 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.320
 just put royce aogo boateng and him 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.700
 takes 9 the agreement then returns to 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.320
 play in bundesliga track that up 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.030
 last year he played at bayern e 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.730
 this team could put up with 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.500
 miller and reus on the wings to run for 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.990
 serve leverwood or defense if 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.570
 will cover the exteriors you have cross that 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.130
 from a distance it can hurt or you could 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.750
 even use it three quarters if this 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.520
 case of make a little feel three 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.260
 star skill because it's usually better 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.530
 having 4, however, is not a very great one 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.970
 lack in any case put seen that a 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.790
 average work average put a 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.440
 trequartista as a motorist married to 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.030
 midfield because when middle high 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.470
 so he would be more suitable as 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.910
 attacking midfielder I don't want to have cross at 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.980
 center of the game then I take two 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.620
 however, go and exchange often 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.480
 match we have de marcos and alba two 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.880
 externals that run a lot so two 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.860
 the defense then very offensive fullbacks 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.510
 i had to put khedira pepper to enjoy 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.970
 maran who give a little coverage 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.130
 in front of dos santos and eze but ready to 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.050
 hit dos santos excellent players 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.640
 first pay reveals review then ed 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.060
 every thing I liked very much at 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.110
 speed ok fantastic 5 star shot 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.990
 so weak foot really 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.640
 exceptional larger top pass 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.030
 passer of the game without any doubt 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.940
 the driven is not bad 5 I saw them 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.380
 I said three stars steel facci 20 breed 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.130
 skillful is always in the right place at 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.830
 right moment 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.560
 by cons if its own 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.870
 just the three stars skill though 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.020
 takes 10 for me the price here is the 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.879
 price is 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.860
 I didn't want to put me first against 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.270
 because anyway I have an idea that it will still have 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.909
 it costs a little to change at the moment 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.860
 1,700,000 his playstation and one million 4 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.750
 on xbox which in my opinion is worth all of us 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.240
 they are much more expensive players than not 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.199
 worth the amount so try it if 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.639
 you have the opportunity to have a 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.590
 extraordinary player 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.970
 we will see each other again soon 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.379
 lay thank you again electoral 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.400
 football and we try to get to 300 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.050
 Lai for this player 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.050
 we will see each other soon
