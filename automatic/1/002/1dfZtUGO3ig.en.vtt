00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.040
‘The Friendly City’ is an initiative by the
Development and Housing Department

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.000
which seeks, teaming up with City Councils,
professionals and citizenry in general,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.960
to open new ways for public-space
intervention policies

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.920
in their evident and necessary
intersection with urban mobility.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.040
‘The Friendly City’ is structured
around three lines of action.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.640
The first one is the Training Programme,
which organises technical conferences

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.040
oriented to provide tools for new ways
of intervention in public space.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.880
Meetings are organised in which the
initiative is carried by local entities.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.080
These meetings are a common bid and dialogue
between public administrations and specialists.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.840
Another line of action is Dissemination,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
which intends to surface good
practice regarding public space.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.280
And finally, there’s the line of action

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.280
which is the one that enables specific measures
in public space at a local level in Andalusia,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.640
thus establishing a collaborative tool between the
Regional Development Department and City Councils.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.440
In the last 40 years, our
cities have undergone

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.360
an accelerated increase in presence
of private vehicles

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.760
that generally occupy up to
sixty percent of public space,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.520
and that, in our view, is evidently
not a sign of an inhabitable city.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.680
In mobility terms, what does
a sustainable mobility imply?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.640
In Seville and its metropolitan area,
44 daily trips to the moon are made every day.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.200
This vicious circle of transport
infrastructures in Spain

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.080
has generated a statistic such as this.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.280
We’ve been immersed in this vicious
circle of transport infrastructures

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.280
to such a level that what we’ve achieved
is to have double the number 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.480
of motorways per inhabitant
than, for instance, France,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.000
and even more than double
if compared to the UK.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.280
And that’s the problem, we’ve
organised our cities and our territory

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.360
at a non-human scale.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.960
It is essential to generate proximity
because the key concept is accessibility,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.880
in other words, what people want is to
have access to services and places

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880
instead of just moving
for the sake of it.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.640
If we make those services be near

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.360
it’ll be possible, for example,
for children to walk to school.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.560
In a time of crisis,
of fraud crisis,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.280
it’s necessary to shed light
with new paradigms to define a city,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.800
what we consider public space is,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.440
and how we can substantially improve
life in cities together with their citizens.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.640
We’re still dealing with
tools and concepts

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.200
that mostly belong  to
19th Century urban planning.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.080
Of course, we have to forget
what traffic meant in order to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.960
incorporate a new series of issues scarcely
taken into consideration up to now;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.800
for instance, themes like air quality,
matters of health,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.840
or recuperating public space,
the vitality of public space,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.240
the importance that public space has

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.440
for our cities to be somewhat
resilient to the crisis

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.280
and therefore manage to remain
despite the situation we’re suffering.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.880
So we have to change many things,
change urban planning,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.600
change street design, regulations,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720
we have to change the
priorities for investment,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.840
change the approach
to the public space network.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.720
We have to change the mobility
model and the city model.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.360
But I believe we are in the best
conditions to achieve it.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.120
Every time we intervene
in the city,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.480
especially with projects of the type
tackled by ‘The Friendly City’,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.160
I think the first thing we have to do
is to find space for pedestrians,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.320
and for the people that use the city.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.000
In that sense, we’ve called it
the collective patio or courtyard.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.200
Somehow, it’s the place par excellence
in Andalusian tradition,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.080
where the patio is the place for
social relations within buildings,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.520
and so, public space is a collective courtyard
that unites society as a whole.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.360
How could a space that has
traditionally been extremely rich

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.320
have been drained of life, uses and activity,
all the more in Mediterranean cities which

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.040
have known how to preserve
these qualities for centuries?

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.160
How could this have happened,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.080
precisely at a time when we are the largest
number of people working for the city?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.400
And on the other hand, where are the
most widely accepted rights of childhood,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.200
so that we could have excluded
children from our streets?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.640
And precisely what safe routes
to school projects say is that

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.840
‘the city must be changed’,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.440
‘the rules of the game must be
changed so that children

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.960
can walk in the streets again,
can play ball again,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.160
can meet their equals again’.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.760
‘The Friendly City’ programme,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.400
in collaboration with the
‘Andalusian Plan for the Bicycle’

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.120
and its inclusion in the
education system,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.040
seeks that school children
develop a critical point of view

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.920
of the dominant mobility system
and the dominant urban system;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640
and that at the same time
they may actively take part

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.280
in the demand of a friendlier city,
a more sustainable mobility,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.880
and a public space in which boys and girls
can enjoy and be the main characters.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.240
There’s no need for big investments,
but what we need is

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.920
to change the way in which we
look at the city and intervene in it.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.720
It’s having a change in the
urban intervention model

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.360
favouring more sustainable policies in the
fields of infrastructures and mobility,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.840
but also logically counting
on social participation,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.960
citizens’ involvement,
with civic participation.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.160
We don’t have a magical wand to say

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.920
‘and which is urban design that
works and the one that doesn’t?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.560
The strategy is to bring the citizenry
to participate and get involved

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.640
in how their street should
be from the start.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.360
We don’t want to transform the urban design,
we want to transform the use of streets

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.040
because the goal is basically
to change the use of streets,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.360
and to do this, we need
citizens’s involvement.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.040
In short, to enrich the city

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.720
we have to do as we’ve
done with our houses,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.360
‘a great part of the space must be more like
a ‘chamber’ room than like a corridor’.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.040
And where are we going to make
the ‘chamber-streets’?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.600
The answer is in the vast majority
of the urban pattern.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.320
If ‘The Friendly City’ has to be something

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.480
that can only be implemented in exceptional
places, like just here and there, well then,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.280
it’s the same old cliché as always,
that’s not a friendly city,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.360
they will only be excepcional,
outstanding friendly places

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.160
but if we are saying that their potential
affects the majority of streets,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.200
then we can start to use
the term ‘Friendly City’.
