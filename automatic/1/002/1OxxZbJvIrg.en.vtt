00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.290
What are you playing?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.480
Chasing the bad guys.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.120
Oh.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.770
Who's that?
- Eh, Papa! I can't see.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.910
Oh man, I lost.
- Alright, it's my turn.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.200
Hey, no way!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.670
What?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.240
You want to help Aki?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.170
Really?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.110
That's good.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.510
Come, come. Help me with this.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.720
Thanks Papa.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.120
Aki, what do you want me to do?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.690
Can you help me pluck this?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.910
Piece of cake.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.730
You sure?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.900
That's it! Pull harder! Harder!
- You alright?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.250
If it's too hard, i'll just do it myself.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.440
I can! I'm strong!

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.730
Wow! You are a strong boy.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.400
Ara? Would you like to try?

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.680
Not so funny now, huh.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.370
Look at it, it's huge.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.540
If you don't know, these are sweet potatoes.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.380
In the olden days, people used to grow their 
own fruits and vegetables.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.790
That's why they were so strong and healthy.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860
What else did they eat?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.810
Lots more. I'll tell you all about it.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.840
Here. Give this to Wan, ask her to boil it.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.310
Mama, please don't go.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.790
Mama. I want to go too.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.730
But you have Kiki don't you? She'll keep you company.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.240
You two better behave yourselves.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.320
Don't trouble Aki and Wan alright?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.770
Not at all, they're in good hands.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.400
Papa, Mama, please don't be gone for too long.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.770
Hey, let them take all the time they want.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.880
It'll be fun. I'm taking you two on a special tour of the village.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.840
We'll watch farmers working on the paddy fields.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.400
We'll see cows, buffaloes, and monkeys 
too. What do you say?

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.700
Mama.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.120
We don't want too.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.960
Take us with you.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.420
We'll be on our way now.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.820
Assalammualaikum.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.250
Waalaikummussalam.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.380
Mama.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.380
Come on, let's go inside.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.820
Ah yes, yes.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.590
Your still playing that? Aren't you bored?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.470
Nope, it's fun.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.160
Give it a rest, come follow me.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.810
Come on, let's go.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.740
Nope.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.620
But why? It's going to be fun.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.810
I don't want to.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.700
That's alright. Ara, you come with me okay?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.680
Let's go Ara.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.630
Why you little...

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.330
Aris, aren't you coming?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.960
No thanks, Aki.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.690
You sure? Your going to regret it.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.180
Really Aki, it's okay.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.720
You really sure?

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.200
Really, Aki.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.380
Hmm. Fine then.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.560
Come on, Ara.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.490
Huh? Great.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.150
Hah! Look Ara.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.560
Beautiful isn't it? It's a paddy field.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.340
Aki.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.860
Changed your mind?

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.960
Batteries died.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.510
Hmm. Come.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.120
Huh? What animal is that?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.920
It's so dirty.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.990
Err, that's a--

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.330
Ha! That's a rhino!

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.350
Oh! A rhino.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.800
Ish! That's not a rhino, it's a buffalo.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.240
Buffalo?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.470
You bluffed!

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.190
Do you know why buffaloes are dirty?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.910
Because buffaloes don't like showers.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.420
Hmph! Very funny.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.290
It's because buffaloes are always soaking in the mud.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.650
Oh.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.870
Hey, who's that?

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.760
There! Over there.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.420
That's the paddy field guy!

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.980
All he does is sits there day and night.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.730
Really? He must be tired.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.140
Haih. Your brother's bluffing again.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.120
That's called a 'scarecrow', it's not a real person.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.960
Its a statue to scare the birds away.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.170
When the birds see the scarecrow, they'll stay away.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.450
Have you all heard the story of Sang Kancil and Kerbau?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.640
Tell us Aki, tell us.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.280
Once upon a time...
