and the other stuff are just 2 bars so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
and the other stuff are just 2 bars so
it<00:01:45.720> depends<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:47.060> how<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> use<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.579> but

it depends on how you want to use it but

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
it depends on how you want to use it but
we're<00:01:50.729> gonna<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.270> game<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.960> don't

we're gonna go into game now I don't

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.190 
we're gonna go into game now I don't
exactly<00:01:52.890> remember<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.579> stage<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.240> pick<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
exactly remember what stage we pick but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.039 
exactly remember what stage we pick but
hopefully<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.649> pick<00:01:55.829> something<00:01:56.100> good<00:01:57.049> I'm

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
hopefully we pick something good I'm

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.899 
hopefully we pick something good I'm
gonna<00:01:58.229> skip<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> scenes<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> scenes

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
gonna skip the scenes because the scenes

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.999 
gonna skip the scenes because the scenes
are<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.329> worth<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> time<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
are not worth the time we just want to
