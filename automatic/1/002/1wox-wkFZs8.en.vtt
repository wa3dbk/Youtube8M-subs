here<00:01:00.140> definitely<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.320> would<00:01:01.530> say<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
here definitely what i would say is the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
here definitely what i would say is the
best<00:01:02.460> recreation<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> any<00:01:04.050> DBZ<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.489> may<00:01:05.670> our

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
best recreation of any DBZ and may our

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
best recreation of any DBZ and may our
movie<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> I've<00:01:06.390> seen<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.080> better<00:01:07.259> than

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
movie that I've seen it was better than

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
movie that I've seen it was better than
all<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.039> enemies<00:01:08.280> well<00:01:08.759> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.090> actually

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
all the enemies well you know actually

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
all the enemies well you know actually
the<00:01:09.660> anime<00:01:09.929> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.590> dated<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.220> guess

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the anime is a little bit dated I guess

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
the anime is a little bit dated I guess
so<00:01:11.670> yeah<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.910> can<00:01:12.210> definitely<00:01:12.300> say<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.660> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so yeah you can definitely say that it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.779 
so yeah you can definitely say that it
would<00:01:12.960> look<00:01:13.229> better<00:01:13.470> than<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.520> actual

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
would look better than so in the actual

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.690 
would look better than so in the actual
car<00:01:15.000> peon<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> mean<00:01:17.190> that's<00:01:17.310> what's<00:01:17.490> going
