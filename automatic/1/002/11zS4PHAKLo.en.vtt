00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:24.599
 hello the friends never love us today 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 here thomas straka made the plan 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.260
 ever rebuilt works 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.440
 Perfect as I heard it 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.949
 yes, that's what we did about it 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:43.140
 who were never baptized 3.0 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.340
 yes, unlike thomas I have here 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.390
 taken a photo flash content spell 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:54.149
 this one is the best here 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.940
 tip get that because a foil 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.620
 can take resistance 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.809
 I admitted it because it was 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:08.250
 works like this too 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:15.170
 transistors herein as are now 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.880
 none mj l 21 194 but I believe b 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.820
 206 or 208 I made two 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.979
 sometimes the same is the winding with 144 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.420
 turns per start executed with 0 20 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.909
 Grad ventilation holes make beautiful pure 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 because the winding is really warm and yes 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.340
 Accordingly , I needed it too 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 no 240 euros withstood 270 above where 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.860
 Resistance and need that a kilo one 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 Potentiometer I could completely 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.659
 replace with this 220 potentiometer 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.310
 I was really at the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.479
 development and at the 12 volt input 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.490
 I have here I come here 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.570
 end really nice to the short border 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.439
 so it can properly extend beautiful 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.130
 talked about how it looks 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.130
 it worked 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.100
 12 times the identical batteries 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.290
 that's the episode patrick hanisch yes 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.310
 that the full battery and that is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.560
 my empty battery is empty in 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.070
 The quotes at 12 72 is the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.070
 now and the hammer at 12 83 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.540
 but 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.629
 granny 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.980
 3 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.110
 It had been 20 minutes 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.599
 I would say yes 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.599
 works great to part
