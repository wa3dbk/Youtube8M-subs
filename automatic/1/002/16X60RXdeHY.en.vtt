00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the more command wise this is basically

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.679 
the more command wise this is basically
the<00:01:32.369> skipping<00:01:32.789> but<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.360> old<00:01:33.509> enough

the skipping but those of you old enough

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.779 
the skipping but those of you old enough
will<00:01:34.380> understand<00:01:34.860> why<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> pull<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> more

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
will understand why I pull it the more

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.690 
will understand why I pull it the more
common<00:01:36.210> whites

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
children to do two steps one way two

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
children to do two steps one way two
steps<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.420> other<00:01:50.510> way

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.580 

reverse<00:02:06.280> sidestep<00:02:07.149> exactly<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> same<00:02:08.229> but

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
reverse sidestep exactly the same but

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.339 
reverse sidestep exactly the same but
going<00:02:08.890> backwards<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:10.450> one<00:02:10.690> can<00:02:10.899> be<00:02:10.929> quite

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
going backwards this one can be quite

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.559 
going backwards this one can be quite
difficult<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.220> again<00:02:12.459> don't<00:02:12.670> expect<00:02:13.120> too<00:02:13.360> much
