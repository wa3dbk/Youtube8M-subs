00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.320
 here I have ten women of corn to 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.210
 My fire popcorn is off right. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.610
 because it has to be just has to be a 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.040
 coarse pot preference and you have 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.050
 who make their popcorn over low heat and 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 Talk to us but it 's such a silly video to do. 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.250
 popcorn and people who do not know us 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.230
 to make popcorn half the popcorn story 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.420
 another half, I admire that it does not 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.890
 times to enjoy because who then 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.529
 here with my off fire and I will 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.339
 put the amount of oil in the tank 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.199
 the touch cover my popcorn does not need 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.409
 see also covered his popcorn 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.400
 enough here that humbles the popcorn ande 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:49.470
 on her that she walks on on the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.489
 open pan it is already good for you 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.500
 put it for you to explore 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.019
 now I will give my fire I will leave the fire 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.360
 on low heat already capped on low heat 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.129
 no hurry to make popcorn can not have 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.379
 hurry otherwise you will burn all that 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.619
 touches the high heat and will not end 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.180
 I'll start calling my fire and 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.040
 monitoring the popcorn 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.510
 slowly to show you 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.300
 then how she goes I go 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.860
 enjoy plenty of popcorn 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.730
 give a glance as well as hopscotch 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.180
 see 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.100
 that's how they stay then they all 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.560
 They are well hopscotch since it means 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.660
 that almost all or all will burst 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.910
 always stay in the other a little bit more 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.860
 This is normal, but that's how it's got to 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.230
 be the point of her amaralina 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.290
 soon begins to burst and as 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.159
 I said yes, I can start there. 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 cover and soon put her in the 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.830
 high fire 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.690
 the rest you already know just put a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.750
 alone to do 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.850
 She 's sweet when I made my popcorn. 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.550
 we dump on your popcorn start 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.800
 was aware that the agreement 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.800
 was almost nothing went to see 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 almost anything that even popcorn burst 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.800
 because it 's a secret that your popcorn like 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.630
 I said it's low fire 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.890
 when you start exploring type in half 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.230
 and realize the sector today is a quantity 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.440
 you will increase the fire has no way 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.440
 you
