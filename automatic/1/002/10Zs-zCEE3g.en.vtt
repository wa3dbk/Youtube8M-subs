repulsor<00:00:00.770> engines<00:00:01.770> they'll<00:00:02.480> pull<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:03.689> it

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
repulsor engines they'll pull you it

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.990 
repulsor engines they'll pull you it
okay

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
okay

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.910 
okay
August<00:00:06.960> 4th<00:00:07.799> 2009<00:00:08.719> 10<00:00:09.719> p.m.<00:00:10.050> approximately<00:00:10.349> we

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
August 4th 2009 10 p.m. approximately we

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
August 4th 2009 10 p.m. approximately we
just<00:00:11.190> finished<00:00:11.610> production<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.509> our<00:00:12.809> very

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
just finished production on our very

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.240 
just finished production on our very
first<00:00:13.820> machine<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.089> much<00:00:15.990> much<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
first machine it's much much like a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880 
first machine it's much much like a
podracer<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.029> basted<00:00:18.390> entirely<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.439> Anakin

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
podracer we basted entirely off Anakin

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.480 
podracer we basted entirely off Anakin
Skywalker's<00:00:20.430> off<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> movies<00:00:21.570> yeah<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
Skywalker's off the movies yeah it's the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.460 
Skywalker's off the movies yeah it's the
same<00:00:23.699> chariot<00:00:24.269> style<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.990> George<00:00:25.289> Lucas

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
same chariot style like George Lucas

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.730 
same chariot style like George Lucas
design<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> movie<00:00:27.050> this<00:00:28.050> thing<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
design in all the movie this thing is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
design in all the movie this thing is
powered<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:30.330> these<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
powered from power these are the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610 
powered from power these are the
controls<00:00:32.149> yeah<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.329> got<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.620> control

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
controls yeah it's got the control

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.729 
controls yeah it's got the control
modules<00:00:35.040> there's<00:00:35.750> that's<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> control<00:00:37.559> module

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
modules there's that's a control module

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.150 
modules there's that's a control module
later<00:00:38.280> type<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:40.110> control<00:00:40.500> harnesses<00:00:41.040> on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
later type to control harnesses on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.930 
later type to control harnesses on
either<00:00:41.340> side<00:00:42.530> our<00:00:43.530> few<00:00:44.460> minutes<00:00:44.730> we'll<00:00:44.820> give

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
either side our few minutes we'll give

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.290 
either side our few minutes we'll give
her<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> fire<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:46.370> it's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> twin<00:00:47.760> repulsor

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
her a fire up it's a twin repulsor

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.119 
her a fire up it's a twin repulsor
engine<00:00:48.600> design<00:00:49.100> its<00:00:50.100> weight<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.820> took<00:00:51.000> two

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
engine design its weight we took two

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
engine design its weight we took two
engines<00:00:53.129> off<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> this

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
engines off of all that what is this

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.950 
engines off of all that what is this
here<00:00:57.050> all<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.109> yeah<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.649> spec<00:00:58.920> sheet<00:00:59.190> shows

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
here all right yeah the spec sheet shows

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.850 
here all right yeah the spec sheet shows
that<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.230> based<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.370> our<00:01:02.489> design<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.860> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that are based on our design we have the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
that are based on our design we have the
power<00:01:05.100> ratio<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.640> pretty<00:01:06.270> great<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
power ratio that's pretty great for the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
power ratio that's pretty great for the
engines<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.650> many<00:01:08.340> say<00:01:08.880> it's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
engines that we have this many say it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
engines that we have this many say it's
not<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> possible<00:01:09.750> machine<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> make<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.180> look

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
not a possible machine to make but look

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
not a possible machine to make but look
at<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.360> design<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> view

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
at this design you actually get a view

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
at this design you actually get a view
from<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> front<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.990> yeah<00:01:15.990> that's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
from the front of this yeah that's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.470 
from the front of this yeah that's
that's<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:18.290> design

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.270 

I'm<00:01:25.480> where<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:25.990> am<00:01:26.410> wearing<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.890> sins<00:01:27.100> of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
I'm where I am wearing the sins of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.110 
I'm where I am wearing the sins of
knowing<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:29.400> start<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.820> up

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
knowing I start that up

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.190 
knowing I start that up
alright<00:01:31.920> quite<00:01:32.920> powerful<00:01:33.400> actually<00:01:34.200> we

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
alright quite powerful actually we

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.300 
alright quite powerful actually we
should<00:01:35.350> probably<00:01:35.380> stand<00:01:35.770> back

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
should probably stand back

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.770 
should probably stand back
if<00:01:36.460> he's<00:01:36.670> gonna<00:01:36.820> fire<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.270> up<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:37.540> got<00:01:37.690> to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
if he's gonna fire it up we got to

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
if he's gonna fire it up we got to
stroll<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.110> thing<00:01:38.290> running<00:01:38.500> are<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.710> gonna

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
stroll this thing running are you gonna

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.270 
stroll this thing running are you gonna
start<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.100> up

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280 

we<00:01:48.280> took<00:01:48.430> took<00:01:49.030> two<00:01:49.270> Honda<00:01:49.600> Civic<00:01:49.900> engines

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
we took took two Honda Civic engines

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.550 
we took took two Honda Civic engines
mounted<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> front<00:01:51.880> made<00:01:52.810> them<00:01:52.930> jet

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
mounted it on the front made them jet

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.420 
mounted it on the front made them jet
capable<00:01:58.560> wait<00:01:59.560> dude<00:01:59.740> maybe<00:01:59.950> try<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.160> other

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
I don't know if you just saw that it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.790 
I don't know if you just saw that it
just<00:02:19.250> fell<00:02:19.460> apart<00:02:23.050> yeah<00:02:24.050> we<00:02:24.319> got<00:02:24.440> some<00:02:24.590> bug's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
just fell apart yeah we got some bug's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.760 
just fell apart yeah we got some bug's
to<00:02:24.950> work<00:02:25.040> out<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.430> guess<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:27.470> there<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.740> have

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
to work out I guess but there you have

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.890 
to work out I guess but there you have
it<00:02:28.130> right<00:02:28.310> oh<00:02:28.610> yeah<00:02:29.090> that's<00:02:29.330> that's<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.750> nice

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
it right oh yeah that's that's a nice

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.520 
it right oh yeah that's that's a nice
machine

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
machine

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.699 
machine
we<00:02:31.160> gotta<00:02:31.990> alright<00:02:32.990> yeah<00:02:33.140> as<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:33.440> tell

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
we gotta alright yeah as you can tell

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.260 
we gotta alright yeah as you can tell
there's<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.950> few<00:02:34.130> bugs<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.790> we<00:02:34.910> need<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.120> work

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
there's a few bugs that we need to work

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.480 
there's a few bugs that we need to work
out<00:02:35.510> still<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.650> still<00:02:36.920> pretty<00:02:37.280> much<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
out still as it's still pretty much a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.550 
out still as it's still pretty much a
prototype<00:02:38.120> many<00:02:38.780> people<00:02:39.020> said<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.290> can't<00:02:39.470> be

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
prototype many people said this can't be

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
prototype many people said this can't be
done<00:02:39.650> we<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.070> think<00:02:40.160> we're<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.520> closest<00:02:40.880> that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
done we I think we're the closest that
