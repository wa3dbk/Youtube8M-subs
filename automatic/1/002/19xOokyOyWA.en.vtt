there<00:00:52.489> but<00:00:52.699> it's<00:00:52.820> not<00:00:52.969> necessarily

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
there but it's not necessarily

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.569 
there but it's not necessarily
controlling<00:00:54.050> every<00:00:54.379> aspect<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:55.070> everyone's
