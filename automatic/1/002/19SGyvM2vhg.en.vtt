00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:10.380
 Yes, this time I asked if I should spend money on the ball so that 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.250
 I would like to express my view on 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.619
 Huh 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.320
 Well if you ask me to spend money on the ball yes yes I think I will answer 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.270
 I will 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:28.480
 That's why I have to think here 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:33.530
 I think it's a bare level I'm a beginner beginners senior but everyone is high for everyone 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:39.350
 Does not say that use of the ball, such as ball advanced players use 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.920
 It is especially beginners If you call the ball a Luxe opportunity or the ball goes bad 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.050
 think 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 Because 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 Not much money 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.060
 If I can't hang it, I just don't want to spend money on balls 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.460
 To say 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.360
 Though I think that it is often 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.950
 It is such people who 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 Landscape of the one you'd like to keep in Well 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.650
 It is to do brand name 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.760
 the same 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.470
 The same ball 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.490
 It is that the use of pillars 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.190
 By doing so, I say sailing 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.370
 In the part called filling 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.620
 I think that there is a big impact on the sea ​​If you use the ball apart and the ocean before you 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.990
 What 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:28.450
 Because it will not be the same feeling 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.060
 It is a green girly short game example Well, especially the impact is large 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.350
 Batting it's also that so Kedomo Well in probe 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.350
 Something or something like rolling 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.579
 1 end run 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 When you want to hit that kind of ball Toka rolling after that to some extent a little over a spin 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.970
 is not it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.970
 Spin amount does not become constant 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.850
 Every time the ball is broken 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.850
 Depending on the performance there may be a stop or a stop 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.490
 It does not matter if it is a ball that does not stop, so use the same from the front 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.430
 Well , how long does it take for spin and from which globalization is constant 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.340
 think 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.130
 So Even if you're beginners 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.030
 This week 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.330
 It is so right to use the same ball 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.010
 Chopsticks dance 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.120
 I bought a ball and keep using that goal 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.120
 It is to do 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.980
 Get over a little bit to it or gold 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.920
 I think that is important 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 And advanced people 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.170
 Even though I know so well towards the Well beginners 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.990
 It is also a time of practice 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:47.790
 I think it is important to practice with the same ball as much as possible 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.880
 Well, naturally there is a ball of the lieutenant general in the practice area, so it is quite so 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 Kedomo squid not do it 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.980
 Ee Short game, in the case of short game 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.510
 There are some old balls used in hoses, etc. 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.930
 With the ball 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.060
 By doing so and I'll practice 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.040
 feeling 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.920
 Feeling and 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.960
 The same every time 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.800
 Become 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.330
 And 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:22.000
 What I did in the practice area 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.930
 I will be able to go in the summer course I will use the same ball consistently from the practice area to the course 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.010
 By 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.050
 Healing becomes constant 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.600
 It is to say 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.040
 Get the same ball 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:37.340
 Theme it I already this basic part is good and will let out the same feeling 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.940
 Because it is told that the course change 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.860
 State of this course 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.850
 Oh dear 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.270
 I think that depending on the course to go around 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.720
 Of course 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.980
 Hino 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.200
 Green speed 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.500
 later 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.430
 I guess is the effect of the lawn it by the term 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.569
 That Tteyuu Toka difficult to take a spin affect predisposed 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.540
 Well I think I understand that is based on it 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:09.710
 If always this spin is a consuming hard lawn than you are practicing 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.230
 Well, let's take a look at rolling a little 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.120
 Also in such judgment criteria 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.720
 It will be, so that part of the official government 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.180
 the ball 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.660
 Apart was the amount of practice using the last time or I the same ball 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.660
 Of practice 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.810
 It's a sense 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.240
 The base to the to 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.260
 In fact course 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.969
 Try it 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.039
 If you try to fix 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.039
 Because it is to do such a thing 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.350
 Score up or something 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.960
 I think that it would be return 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.590
 This time is a little 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.860
 I do not know whether it was helpful 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.860
 Thank you for wanting to end here
