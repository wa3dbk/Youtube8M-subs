00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.350
 the people who work in the chain 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.150
 of manufacturing distribution and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.189
 marketing of medicines are 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.839
 worried they fear that the decline of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.759
 prices on the products ordered by 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.599
 the new drug law leave 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.599
 many without employment 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.040
 today the trade union union of visitors 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.480
 doctors who represent about 100 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.670
 professionals let the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.039
 address of medicines that overwhelm them 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 this week 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.910
 all sellers have been fired 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.910
 from a pharmaceutical laboratory 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 if you can see the classifieds 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 of the newspapers there are already several pharmacies 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.320
 that are selling and that comes to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.070
 also affect the stability of the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.650
 therefore also dependent pharmacy 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 the promoters that previously promoted 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.210
 leading sale products in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.850
 pharmacies because now it is not known where 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.620
 they are going to relocate the pharmaceutical industry 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.470
 generates in Salvador 8 thousand jobs 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 direct and about 15,000 indirect figures 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.070
 that could be reduced say due to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 impact of the regulations that put a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.470
 price cap to the medicines we are the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.390
 what else are we going to suffer the most affected 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.060
 so we want to be invited to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.870
 the meetings and that we are also told 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.729
 what can be done to avoid and 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.869
 protect the labor stability of 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.610
 workers 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.880
 the Salvadoran pharmaceutical industry 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 It is integrated by 231 laboratories 99 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 drugstores and 1,300 pharmacies industry 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.030
 which is signaled to distribute the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.290
 medicine at prices so high that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.479
 becomes inaccessible to the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.070
 consumer the visitors say that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.990
 on this claim that prices 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.590
 are the highest in the world have their 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 Doubts 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 I ask myself in these moments that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.429
 I pray the law that prices are already 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.329
 of maximum sale to the public where they are 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.569
 those prices of 5 thousand percent where 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.569
 they are because you look if you analyze the 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.549
 law there are many products of many 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.100
 pharmaceutical industries that are 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.170
 below the maximum sale price at 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.520
 public the objective of the union of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.079
 visitors is that the management of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 medicines listen to your concerns 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.619
 as well as I have listened to drugstores 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.170
 laboratories and pharmacy owners 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.170
