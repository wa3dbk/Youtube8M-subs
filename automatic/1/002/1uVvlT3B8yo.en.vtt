00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.139
 when we already have our songs 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.689
 Selected favorites we are ready 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.759
 for the party but there is something else we do not 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.680
 like to have a dj in our house 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.140
 so that the party was so lively 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.020
 like a disco 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.600
 ex boom has the solution with smart dj 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.330

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.860
 our party is much more fun 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.480
 this function adds effects for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
 automatically to mix the music 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 without pauses what I want to say is that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 smart dj of the former boom is so smart 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.140
 that analyzes the sequence of the song and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.120
 Find the right time to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.110
 mix it with the next one for this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.110
 has two modes 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.350
 electronic and house plus there are three 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.470
 levels in each one I measure high and low 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.440
 we usually use mido now we are 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.000
 ready to enjoy music 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.940
 adding a lot more effects just like 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.590

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.570
 shot delay and beat of law in addition to this 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.960
 you have to add the beatbox what it means 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.360
 this that exposes mixes a simple rhythm 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.090
 between song and song with this the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.759
 music never for xbox has four 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.000
 rhythms for electronic music and four 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.880

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.509
 we add that it has the function of 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.710
 crossfire that gently mixes a 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.930
 song with the other 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.550
 the fun never ends there are others 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.009
 equipment that have similar functions 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.080
 but the former boom is the only one that does 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.899

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.979
