00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.760
 It was a good start to the season for the ESV 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.860
 lok pirna even if the last throw 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.510
 next to it went sv anhalt bernburg 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.110
 separated the railroaders 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.110
 undecided 27 27 it was after 60 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.400
 pack burners fall when you look 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.920
 I think it is full on 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.180
 first a point loss we have with 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.010
 the second age still with five goals 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.820
 guided 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.550
 has to connection I think then a 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.230
 the concentration has diminished 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.269
 air was a bit lacking for the first 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.519
 home victory really needs is not much 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.770
 in fact, it was only a few seconds 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.960
 or a happy hand to hand over 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.090
 concludes the draw against bernburg 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.700
 but also showed where the problems with 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.469
 esv lok lie down to year old has loud 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.840
 No new entry into the 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.120
 startformation the already small 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.540
 kader announces the season opener 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.180
 strong performance differentials on we have 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.840
 17 guys who played the regional 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.149
 have the perpetrators are the are a 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.270
 Training training is good but still 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.340
 not so far even they need that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.860
 new arrivals false belief paul gardener 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.580
 and hannes ulbricht were against hamburg 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.590
 only spectators 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.770
 they stand for the new philosophy of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.500
 esv lok and takes time with boys 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.160
 players from the region may want 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.289
 Long term success 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.500
 currently this means for the rest of the 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.539
 teams have fun working in the entire 60 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.720
 minutes against bernburg were only 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.970
 seven field players 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.800
 on the parquet today the time is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.830
 almost impossible to play by and 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.320
 still there the thorsten played through 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.960
 I think only two minutes first 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 Halftime gets punishment and in Djibouti 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.460
 just as was so the guys are 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.050
 have run like crazy 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 for that it is even more bitter that the 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.700
 that was not enough today 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.100
 the team is fit that has them against 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.290
 hamburg impressively proved how 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.540
 for a long time she can withstand the strain 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.179
 the esv lok dares the dance on the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.040
 razor blade injured banned because 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.240
 failures can not currently 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.280
 be compensated 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.070
 striking in the game against bernburg was 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.050
 Also horns missing a left-hander no 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.020
 player from the root squad has one 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.420
 left adhesive and real reinforcements are 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.140
 not in sight 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.300
 currently not on the screen at all 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.430
 We will be there for the next 14 days 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.750
 still in spanish glass students in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.190
 record our rows there plays 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.900
 left outer circle center but one 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.760
 left-handed you have to look we have 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.680
 until the 15th there was still someone 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.420
 but we also have to commit 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.550
 someday a happy one 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.090
 have discussions with sponsors 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.980
 otherwise it probably will not 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.959
 low budget small squad 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.510
 It's going to be a tough season for the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.550
 esc lok but the external circumstances are 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.620
 for some a chance of heath 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.959
 torsten schneider, for example, belongs 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.950
 now to the leaders with six 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.500
 and a bear strong 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.880
 defense against hamburg 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.740
 Cannes as the best 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.960
 also stefan helbig gets his now 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.740
 First-time could play 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.690
 to convince 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.820
 schneider and helbig stand for the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.600
 new esv lok pirna and for one 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.610
 promise 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.710
 fight passion these are the two 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.140
 It was going to be the next morning 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.760
 months in every home game to 100 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.520
 percent of us and should be 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.410
 you also win victories in the long term abo 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.070
 at home games it will not 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.810
 give more 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.300
 but then as handball friends have one 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.520
 There was a lot of applause for that 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.590
 team after the match against hamburg too 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.590
 right because the team has character
