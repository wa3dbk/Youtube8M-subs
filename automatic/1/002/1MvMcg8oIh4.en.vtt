 Soprano solo stuff actually sounds like the easy accent wagoner 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.270

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.619
 Think of the Hamburg Millerntor that is out of the course of the

 HM, therefore, he says on the car Hanover dpa 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.970

 because Chancellor before then if you first correctly the EHC Biel we will 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.690
 Verizon shared 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 that's thanks to the depth of view 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.350
 relations 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.620
 In spite of the small Cottbus you have to complain so it is stopped 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.420
 lies behind 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.820
 the woman wanted 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.590
 Yes OK 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.620
 I guess in the case it does, it's really out of it so that's too 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.160
 that's not metal, it's not smart 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.670
 bru but to that he is ultimately remembered from the walls 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.000
 not way 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 the feel of the game 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.130
 I would say to the little bit of Music Manaus now held Anna Larsson 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.440
 Yartey is simply in the hand had given what you can now 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.440
 are now with this song with the one with which the scorer still conjure 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.960
 The Wersener the palette of course wanted to keep it up when you went to the 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.459
 again, very different here 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.249

 HR Dirk Bockel a 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.949
 here 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.970
 possible the man says the amplifier 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.379
 set too fast Kranig 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.379
 the 500 meters across the stage to run my amp 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.669
 and I'll just lower in Trebel 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.479
 Ben 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.710
 you know that from the 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.329
 5 percent 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.749

 here we are just saying a new war Pauli

 "It may have been an accident now maybe not quite so much around Vienna 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.560

 11 multifaceted this can be especially in the city and with which I am very very 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.489
 I would do a lot of different things that way, too 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.489
 as a double-edged sword seven-sided so stupid 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.129
 here the cops clean up 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.950
 above which we have found out quite casually explains Advisory 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.239
 There are Rok 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.510
 he is and Crunchy each in Crete and bass from Europeans is a man with 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.659
 less windings 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.659
 No and more windings water sounds a bit powerful 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.009
 i know how practicable is you can stop while in sunlight and 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.889
 Hawk a kicker per song you can only pull Ziehm solo as percent of all 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.769
 Criminal processes behind the pickup change that is the whole trick one is 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.739
 then a little bit 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.029
 fixed on it 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:04.029
 Russwurm windows and so change if you are new in the kitchen 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.179
 a really good guitarist has only his own no look therefore 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.070
 that Ireland should look for potential technicians 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.070
 at the other parties from APA APA 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.969
 yes, yes 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.299
 1a and I would say synonymous if you now with the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.890
 what is included with the Blue Black Amberger visibly 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.289
 Satisfied then you have a real crisp Classic Rock 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.210
 there is nothing to moan about the fence I have the shape 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.879
 into the game feelings very much 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.400
 However, I also have a real point of criticism Dr Digital for 

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.629
 me unfortunately 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.619
 So it's almost completely useless for me now 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:44.150
 feeling 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.070
 the very 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.090
 Head lets itself 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.160
 yes and that will not be better if you have the capes I have 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.220
 So I always felt like that, I did not have to worry about that 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.370
 Take care of the neck 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.330
 he had not had them at other mind what he had done so far so far 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.530
 but that can be also that we offer to Brigitte that there something that the head 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.400
 away quickly 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.580
 There you can handle wonderful 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.229
 Here we are now 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.629
 so the original thought or Denner is read and already has 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:11.860
 already thought 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.870
 if digital let her head and she has percent really because then 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.309
 also converted to keep them in balance 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:22.419
 I do not know so digital is apparently in the little bit different 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.629
 Rides than what the arm to us team did not think that the fathers already 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.619
 down here because even the construction has to hold itself there I have a bit 

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:31.529
 So keep it down when you make the wedding ring like this 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.219
 at Flutsch Tier unter 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.300
 may now be a wood lie our world would have you back one more 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:40.770
 a little bit what we do now you can not sour Senior yet another 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:41.999
 Point for the European Championship 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.129
 for the court 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.770
 but in my opinion that did not bring stability 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.460
 The same went for a digital good job without the 

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:51.200
 distance 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.820
 Of course, no one takes that away either way many times 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.850
 Percent, the first thing I have in a new episode is the number of teenagers 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.850
 determine because the one in Villach existed there 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.830
 why must make sure that it priced where the deeper is 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.909
 700 Euro 649 percent for this price is definitely good serially 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.110
 is made as a playable Trier 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.990
 and s i would say and so already sign a matter of taste extreme 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.700
 Swiss HAUBRICHS Chr so ​​who dares to withdraw from the 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.339
 Let me tell you about Taus's questions 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.560
 around the brothel Stadtförster 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.570
 Many of them have definitely found what else 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.050
 many options also offers so visually that percent just pulls 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.889
 Not 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.460
 and that Tommy herself 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.360
 More in the seventies than I would never have thought again is running over here 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.510
 now the defense network typical Classic Rock lives on was great for 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.759
 Graduation lead by her 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.930
 grateful no 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.619
 Hackers could 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.619
 has Apple 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.639
 more popular 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.870
 again 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.490
 Super great 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.960
 it was burden here and the opportunity at full load 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.740
 for the Mistletoe viewers look at them as well as they do it 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.810
 means enter 100 and this is the BLG 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.349
 blond St the construction is on 4 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:29.219
 which is good to believe soon
