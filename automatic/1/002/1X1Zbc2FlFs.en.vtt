hey guys CT stealth here and last time i
did<00:00:03.899> my<00:00:04.080> video<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.740> rigging<00:00:05.100> thing<00:00:05.310> i

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
did my video on this rigging thing i

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.820 
did my video on this rigging thing i
actually<00:00:05.790> made<00:00:05.970> like<00:00:06.509> six<00:00:06.870> videos<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.680> then<00:00:07.799> I

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
actually made like six videos and then I

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.209 
actually made like six videos and then I
accidentally<00:00:08.990> had<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.170> mute<00:00:10.469> button<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.070> my

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
accidentally had my mute button on my

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.390 
accidentally had my mute button on my
mic<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> felt<00:00:12.360> like<00:00:12.480> full<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.280> I'm

waste<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.660> three<00:00:18.930> hours<00:00:19.189> that<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.250> could

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
waste of like three hours that I could

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.359 
waste of like three hours that I could
have<00:00:20.490> been<00:00:20.609> working<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.090> stuff<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> anyway

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
have been working on stuff so anyway

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.550 
have been working on stuff so anyway
what<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.570> doing<00:00:24.720> right<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.260> is

what I'm going to be doing right now is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.250 
what I'm going to be doing right now is
I'm<00:00:26.150> setting<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.449> nice<00:00:27.689> little<00:00:27.930> bone

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I'm setting up that nice little bone

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.330 
I'm setting up that nice little bone
rigging<00:00:29.070> joint<00:00:29.369> based<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.119> my<00:00:30.150> last<00:00:30.599> video<00:00:30.960> as

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
rigging joint based off my last video as

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.950 
rigging joint based off my last video as
you<00:00:32.340> saw<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.910> basically<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.570> setting

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
you saw and basically I'm just setting

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.790 
you saw and basically I'm just setting
up<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.260> joint<00:00:37.800> system<00:00:39.379> like<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.500> said<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> can

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
up my joint system like I said you can

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.350 
up my joint system like I said you can
only<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> side<00:00:42.629> view<00:00:43.700> or<00:00:44.700> top

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
only do that in the side view or top

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
only do that in the side view or top
view<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.840> front<00:00:46.050> view<00:00:46.760> anyway<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
view or front view anyway so now that I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.709 
view or front view anyway so now that I
come<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.510> named<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.170> these<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> if<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
come in here named all these so if you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
come in here named all these so if you
remember<00:00:55.050> exactly<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> said<00:00:55.770> last<00:00:56.160> time

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
remember exactly what I said last time

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.720 
remember exactly what I said last time
you<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.469> know<00:00:58.469> three<00:00:58.980> things<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.489> might

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you need to know three things I might

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.010 
you need to know three things I might
have<00:00:59.850> said<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.600> been<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> while

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
have said it it's kind of been a while

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
have said it it's kind of been a while
but<00:01:01.649> anyway<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.640> need<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:02.940> three<00:01:03.210> things

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but anyway you need to know three things

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
but anyway you need to know three things
while<00:01:03.780> making<00:01:04.680> bones<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
while making bones one is you need to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.109 
while making bones one is you need to
worry<00:01:06.659> about<00:01:06.810> position<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:08.189> orientation

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
worry about position then orientation

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.410 
worry about position then orientation
and<00:01:09.299> local<00:01:09.960> axis<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.070> local<00:01:11.520> rotation<00:01:11.850> axis

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and local axis the local rotation axis

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.249 
and local axis the local rotation axis
so<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:15.170> going<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> already<00:01:17.729> tell

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
show you that and I can already tell

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
show you that and I can already tell
just<00:01:18.390> based<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.250> orientations<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> my

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
just based on the orientations of my

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
just based on the orientations of my
bones<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.909> they're<00:01:21.180> wrong<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.170> probably

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
bones that they're wrong you probably

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.950 
bones that they're wrong you probably
can't<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.780> there's<00:01:24.780> these

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can't see it but I see it there's these

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
can't see it but I see it there's these
little<00:01:25.020> lines<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.680> anyway<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.000> position

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
little lines here anyway so position

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
little lines here anyway so position
what<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.799> most<00:01:29.250> likely<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
what you would do is you most likely you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
what you would do is you most likely you
would<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> mesh<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.960> would<00:01:31.110> position

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
would have a mesh and you would position

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.100 
would have a mesh and you would position
these<00:01:31.740> bones<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.430> accordingly<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.600> when

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
these bones to be accordingly now when

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
these bones to be accordingly now when
you<00:01:34.140> make<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> side<00:01:34.950> view<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.600> need

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you make this in the side view you need

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.719 
you make this in the side view you need
to<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.780> worried<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.770> everything<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.430> going

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to be worried of everything that's going

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
to be worried of everything that's going
on<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> channel<00:01:39.810> box<00:01:40.070> because<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.220> want

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
on in the channel box because we want

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.880 
on in the channel box because we want
this<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.030> null<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.689> possible<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
this to be as null as possible if you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.270 
this to be as null as possible if you
have<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.310> random<00:01:44.970> rotate<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.020> scale

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
have some random rotate or scale

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.429 
have some random rotate or scale
something<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.579> did<00:01:47.880> moved<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> could<00:01:49.350> be

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
something you did moved and it could be

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
something you did moved and it could be
wrong<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> talk<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> about

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
wrong so I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
wrong so I'm going to talk to you about
the<00:01:51.990> different<00:01:52.470> types<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.799> bones<00:01:53.149> there's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the different types of bones there's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.289 
the different types of bones there's
three<00:01:54.390> sets<00:01:54.689> there's<00:01:55.409> buying<00:01:55.799> bones<00:01:56.040> FK<00:01:57.030> bones

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
three sets there's buying bones FK bones

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.319 
three sets there's buying bones FK bones
and<00:01:57.600> ik<00:01:57.869> bones<00:01:58.310> FK<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.700> all<00:01:59.909> forward

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and ik bones FK is for all forward

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.810 
and ik bones FK is for all forward
kinematics<00:02:00.479> these<00:02:01.020> typically<00:02:01.610> involve<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
kinematics these typically involve the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730 
kinematics these typically involve the
rotations<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.630> rotate<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> circle<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
rotations you rotate a circle and the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
rotations you rotate a circle and the
bone<00:02:04.920> follows<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.479> demonstrate

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
bone follows I can kind of demonstrate

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
bone follows I can kind of demonstrate
that<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that here so as you can see I can just

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.240 
that here so as you can see I can just
click<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.989> each<00:02:10.140> bone<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.709> rotate<00:02:11.009> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
click on each bone and I can rotate that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.809 
click on each bone and I can rotate that
that<00:02:11.550> is

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
that is

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.569 
that is
k<00:02:12.090> ik<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.140> where<00:02:13.439> you<00:02:13.590> do<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.769> opposite<00:02:14.519> of

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
k ik is where you do the opposite of

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.899 
k ik is where you do the opposite of
that<00:02:14.670> where<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.579> controller<00:02:17.579> that's

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
that where I have a controller that's

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.910 
that where I have a controller that's
somewhere<00:02:18.389> typically<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.439> foot<00:02:19.650> it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
somewhere typically on on the foot it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.729 
somewhere typically on on the foot it
will<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.159> right<00:02:20.370> right<00:02:20.849> here<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.409> it<00:02:22.409> moves

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
will be right right here and it moves

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.949 
will be right right here and it moves
everything<00:02:23.189> else<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.849> don't<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.450> set<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
everything else I don't have that set so

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.649 
everything else I don't have that set so
I<00:02:25.019> can't<00:02:25.260> show<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.469> that<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:27.599> what

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
I can't show you that but that's what

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.809 
I can't show you that but that's what
the<00:02:27.810> ik<00:02:27.930> does<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.950> blind<00:02:29.219> bones<00:02:29.489> is

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
the ik does and the blind bones is

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.270 
the ik does and the blind bones is
what's<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.930> bones<00:02:31.439> are<00:02:31.680> bounded<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.069> this

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
what's what bones are bounded to this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.270 
what's what bones are bounded to this

end<00:02:39.900> up<00:02:40.169> using<00:02:40.469> to<00:02:40.950> make<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.700> mesh<00:02:41.909> deform<00:02:42.120> so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
end up using to make is mesh deform so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.550 
end up using to make is mesh deform so
we<00:02:42.930> need<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.109> set<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.409> up<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:44.639> like<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.299> said

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
we need to set that up so like I said

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.690 
we need to set that up so like I said
first<00:02:46.560> we're<00:02:46.799> going<00:02:46.889> to<00:02:46.980> talk<00:02:47.159> to<00:02:47.370> about

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
first we're going to talk to about

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.729 
first we're going to talk to about
positioning<00:02:48.389> so<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.629> would<00:02:49.139> position<00:02:49.439> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
positioning so you would position the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.199 
positioning so you would position the
mesh<00:02:49.949> and<00:02:50.250> there'd<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.639> mess<00:02:50.879> here<00:02:51.090> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
mesh and there'd be a mess here and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.209 
mesh and there'd be a mess here and
these<00:02:51.569> bones<00:02:51.989> would<00:02:52.230> follow<00:02:52.469> along<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.010> lines

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 
these bones would follow along the lines

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.720 
these bones would follow along the lines
of<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.760> mesh<00:02:53.939> so<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.840> being<00:02:55.349> said<00:02:55.639> then<00:02:56.639> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
of the mesh so that being said then you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
of the mesh so that being said then you
can<00:02:56.819> go<00:02:56.909> down<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.269> second<00:02:57.569> point<00:02:58.109> is<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
can go down to the second point is the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.979 
can go down to the second point is the
orientation<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.299> i'm<00:03:00.510> going<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.750> hold<00:03:00.870> down

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
orientation so i'm going to hold down

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.170 
orientation so i'm going to hold down
the<00:03:01.230> w<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.829> i<00:03:01.859> want<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> left-click<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.969> i'm

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the w and i want to left-click and i'm

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.119 
the w and i want to left-click and i'm
going<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.359> go<00:03:03.419> to<00:03:03.510> object<00:03:03.659> right<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.590> and

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
going to go to object right here and

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.599 
going to go to object right here and
you'll<00:03:05.639> notice<00:03:05.969> that<00:03:06.769> my<00:03:07.769> manipulator<00:03:08.310> make

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
you'll notice that my manipulator make

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.509 
you'll notice that my manipulator make
sure<00:03:08.639> it's<00:03:08.879> on<00:03:08.969> move<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.530> i<00:03:10.530> can<00:03:10.739> press<00:03:10.949> down

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
sure it's on move and i can press down

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.899 
sure it's on move and i can press down
and<00:03:11.969> you'll<00:03:12.180> see<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.799> y<00:03:14.930> variable<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:17.069> y

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
and you'll see that the y variable the y

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.300 
and you'll see that the y variable the y
arrow<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.509> actually<00:03:18.900> pointing<00:03:19.319> downward

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
arrow is actually pointing downward

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.699 
arrow is actually pointing downward
towards<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.729> bone<00:03:20.879> no<00:03:21.449> matter<00:03:21.629> where<00:03:22.560> i<00:03:22.590> go

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
towards the bone no matter where i go

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.589 
towards the bone no matter where i go
and<00:03:23.099> it's<00:03:23.549> might<00:03:23.909> be<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> little<00:03:24.209> bit<00:03:24.359> hard<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
and it's might be a little bit hard to

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.770 
and it's might be a little bit hard to
see<00:03:24.840> since<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.919> all<00:03:26.159> green<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.479> is<00:03:27.659> in

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
see since it's all green but it is in

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.710 
see since it's all green but it is in
fact<00:03:27.810> pointing<00:03:28.379> down<00:03:29.150> whichever<00:03:30.150> direction

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
fact pointing down whichever direction

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.319 
fact pointing down whichever direction
the<00:03:30.900> bone<00:03:31.139> goes<00:03:31.379> this<00:03:32.009> is<00:03:32.250> bad<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:33.000> don't<00:03:33.120> want

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
the bone goes this is bad we don't want

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.819 
the bone goes this is bad we don't want
this<00:03:33.479> at<00:03:33.659> all<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:33.989> fact<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:35.220> actually<00:03:35.579> want<00:03:35.819> the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
this at all in fact we actually want the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.240 
this at all in fact we actually want the
X<00:03:38.479> to<00:03:39.479> always<00:03:40.169> be<00:03:40.319> pointing<00:03:40.680> downward<00:03:41.099> and

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
X to always be pointing downward and

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.539 
X to always be pointing downward and
this<00:03:41.729> is<00:03:41.879> for<00:03:42.060> easy<00:03:42.329> rotations<00:03:43.549> especially

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
this is for easy rotations especially

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.719 
this is for easy rotations especially
later<00:03:44.759> on<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.889> what<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:46.919> have<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.579> have

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
later on so what I have to do is I have

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.219 
later on so what I have to do is I have
to<00:03:47.819> come<00:03:48.000> make<00:03:48.239> sure<00:03:48.389> in<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.659> animation<00:03:48.989> when

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
to come make sure in the animation when

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.830 
to come make sure in the animation when
you<00:03:49.349> said<00:03:49.560> go<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.799> skeleton<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.549> go<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> orient

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you said go to skeleton and go to orient

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.050 
you said go to skeleton and go to orient
joint<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> option<00:03:53.099> box<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.970> I'll

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
joint and then the option box and I'll

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.709 
joint and then the option box and I'll
have<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.359> options<00:03:54.959> here<00:03:55.469> I<00:03:56.599> don't<00:03:57.599> really

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
have this options here I don't really

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.479 
have this options here I don't really
have<00:03:57.810> anywhere<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.229> put<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:59.040> might<00:03:59.250> come

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
have anywhere to put it so it might come

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.580 
have anywhere to put it so it might come
off<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.759> screen<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> little<00:04:00.150> bit<00:04:00.419> so<00:04:01.079> all<00:04:01.409> right

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
off the screen a little bit so all right

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.229 
off the screen a little bit so all right
come<00:04:02.099> back<00:04:02.129> over<00:04:02.459> here<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.699> my<00:04:02.790> bone<00:04:03.000> and

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
come back over here to my bone and

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.909 
come back over here to my bone and
you'll<00:04:03.599> notice<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.139> arrow<00:04:04.319> still<00:04:04.650> pointing

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
you'll notice the arrow still pointing

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.219 
you'll notice the arrow still pointing
down<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.519> when<00:04:05.759> I<00:04:05.790> can't<00:04:06.060> apply<00:04:06.449> and<00:04:06.959> you'll

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
down and when I can't apply and you'll

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.589 
down and when I can't apply and you'll
notice<00:04:07.469> that<00:04:07.560> now<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.219> X<00:04:08.639> is<00:04:08.969> pointing<00:04:09.419> down

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
notice that now the X is pointing down

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.679 
notice that now the X is pointing down
towards<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.650> bone<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.150> use<00:04:12.419> one<00:04:12.659> of

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
towards the bone and you can use one of

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.539 
towards the bone and you can use one of
these<00:04:12.840> options<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.709> really<00:04:14.069> just<00:04:14.250> kind<00:04:14.519> of

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
these options it really just kind of

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.629 
these options it really just kind of
depends<00:04:14.909> I<00:04:15.150> can't<00:04:15.599> remember<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.680> basically

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
depends I can't remember so basically

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.159 
depends I can't remember so basically
you<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.000> need<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.389> select<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.750> bone<00:04:18.959> and

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
you just need to select the bone and

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.760 
you just need to select the bone and
press<00:04:19.349> downward<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:22.560> have<00:04:22.620> to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
press downward and you don't have to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.350 
press downward and you don't have to
worry<00:04:22.949> about<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.219> toe<00:04:23.370> bone<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.820> tome<00:04:24.000> own<00:04:24.180> is

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
worry about the toe bone the tome own is

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.970 
worry about the toe bone the tome own is
just<00:04:24.599> there<00:04:24.779> to<00:04:24.810> represent<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.409> end

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
just there to represent the end

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.610 
just there to represent the end
it's<00:04:26.130> only<00:04:26.340> everything<00:04:26.910> else<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:28.080> I'm<00:04:28.440> just

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
it's only everything else so I'm just

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.230 
it's only everything else so I'm just
pressing<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.370> down<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.910> can<00:04:30.090> go

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
pressing up and down and I can go

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.720 
pressing up and down and I can go
through<00:04:30.570> my<00:04:30.780> hierarchy<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.530> look<00:04:31.770> at<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.040> X

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
through my hierarchy and look at the X

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.640 
through my hierarchy and look at the X
and<00:04:33.090> make<00:04:33.240> sure<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.540> red<00:04:33.720> arrow<00:04:33.960> points<00:04:34.470> down

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
and make sure the red arrow points down

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.250 
and make sure the red arrow points down
the<00:04:34.770> bone<00:04:34.890> all<00:04:35.580> right<00:04:35.780> now<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:36.990> that's<00:04:37.140> done

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
the bone all right now that that's done

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.140 
the bone all right now that that's done
I'm<00:04:37.890> going<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.130> pull<00:04:38.250> up<00:04:38.340> my<00:04:38.490> script<00:04:38.820> editor

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
I'm going to pull up my script editor

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.380 
I'm going to pull up my script editor
and<00:04:40.140> just<00:04:40.590> ignore<00:04:40.920> all<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.240> guess

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
and just ignore all that and I guess

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.190 
and just ignore all that and I guess
that<00:04:42.540> okay<00:04:43.170> new<00:04:43.320> tab<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:44.190> command<00:04:44.670> new<00:04:44.850> tab

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
that okay new tab so command new tab

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.370 
that okay new tab so command new tab
alright<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:47.310> now<00:04:47.820> is<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.210> local<00:04:48.570> rotation<00:04:49.020> X

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
alright so now is the local rotation X

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.850 
alright so now is the local rotation X
minimize<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.580> my<00:04:50.730> bones<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.860> need

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
minimize that so you see my bones I need

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.270 
minimize that so you see my bones I need
to<00:04:52.980> come<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:54.480> component<00:04:54.960> mode<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.280> come

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
to come to the component mode and come

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.090 
to come to the component mode and come
to<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.490> little<00:04:56.670> ?<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.450> right<00:04:57.690> click<00:04:57.930> hold<00:04:58.380> go

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
to this little ? and right click hold go

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.880 
to this little ? and right click hold go
to<00:04:59.160> local<00:04:59.700> rotation<00:05:00.030> axes<00:05:00.560> all<00:05:01.560> right<00:05:01.710> now

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
to local rotation axes all right now

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.350 
to local rotation axes all right now
what<00:05:02.070> I'll<00:05:02.190> see<00:05:02.370> here<00:05:02.640> is<00:05:02.820> I'll<00:05:02.940> see<00:05:03.090> all<00:05:03.120> these

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
what I'll see here is I'll see all these

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.440 
what I'll see here is I'll see all these
axes<00:05:04.020> these<00:05:04.680> axes<00:05:05.550> need<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.000> point<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.390> the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
axes these axes need to point in the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.960 
axes these axes need to point in the
general<00:05:06.780> direction<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:07.290> whatever<00:05:07.730> you<00:05:08.730> want

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
general direction of whatever you want

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.270 
general direction of whatever you want
to<00:05:09.120> be<00:05:09.210> positive<00:05:09.420> or<00:05:09.870> negative<00:05:10.200> if<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:11.130> have

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
to be positive or negative if you have

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.170 
to be positive or negative if you have
two<00:05:11.490> sets<00:05:11.700> of<00:05:11.850> bones<00:05:13.670> let's<00:05:14.670> just<00:05:14.820> say<00:05:14.910> there's

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
two sets of bones let's just say there's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.750 
two sets of bones let's just say there's
one<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:15.990> there's<00:05:16.980> like<00:05:17.040> one<00:05:17.250> over<00:05:17.430> here<00:05:17.610> and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
one here there's like one over here and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.190 
one here there's like one over here and
this<00:05:17.910> one's<00:05:18.120> like<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.420> left<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.930> this<00:05:18.990> one's

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
this one's like the left and this one's

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.120 
this one's like the left and this one's
the<00:05:19.260> right<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:20.310> you'd<00:05:21.210> want<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.570> Z<00:05:21.930> as<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.980> as

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
the right so you'd want the Z as it as

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.880 
the right so you'd want the Z as it as
this<00:05:23.670> leg<00:05:23.970> swings<00:05:24.390> outward<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:25.200> way<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.770> be

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
this leg swings outward this way to be

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.860 
this leg swings outward this way to be
positive<00:05:26.100> in<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:27.360> channel<00:05:27.990> box<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:29.070> let's<00:05:29.430> see

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
positive in the channel box so let's see

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.910 
positive in the channel box so let's see
here's<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.020> Y<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.270> Y<00:05:33.450> rotate<00:05:33.990> as<00:05:34.230> you

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
here's the Y so the Y rotate as you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.790 
here's the Y so the Y rotate as you
notice<00:05:35.370> as<00:05:35.550> I<00:05:35.700> move<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.240> leg<00:05:36.420> outward<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:37.560> why

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
notice as I move the leg outward the why

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.780 
notice as I move the leg outward the why
ignore<00:05:38.640> the<00:05:39.090> Z<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.360> X<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:40.170> Y<00:05:40.200> is<00:05:40.410> actually<00:05:40.980> 42

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
ignore the Z and X the Y is actually 42

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.470 
ignore the Z and X the Y is actually 42
that's<00:05:42.420> a<00:05:42.540> positive<00:05:42.720> number<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.970> on<00:05:44.970> this<00:05:45.180> null

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
that's a positive number so on this null

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.050 
that's a positive number so on this null
DS<00:05:45.720> back<00:05:45.990> up<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:47.090> we<00:05:48.090> want<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.390> so<00:05:49.260> we<00:05:50.060> rotate

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
DS back up and we want that so we rotate

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.290 
DS back up and we want that so we rotate
these<00:05:51.240> axes<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:52.530> way<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:53.220> get<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:54.150> get

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
these axes this way to get that to get

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.930 
these axes this way to get that to get
that<00:05:54.450> result<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:55.500> like<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.490> said<00:05:56.580> I'm<00:05:56.700> pulling

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
that result so like I said I'm pulling

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.550 
that result so like I said I'm pulling
up<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.150> script<00:05:57.390> editor<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:58.050> I'm<00:05:58.380> just<00:05:58.470> going

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
up the script editor and I'm just going

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.660 
up the script editor and I'm just going
to<00:05:58.680> type<00:05:58.860> in<00:05:58.980> a<00:05:59.100> simple<00:05:59.400> command<00:05:59.520> rotate<00:06:00.380> 180

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
to type in a simple command rotate 180

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.950 
to type in a simple command rotate 180
00<00:06:02.670> make<00:06:02.940> sure<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.240> space<00:06:03.480> is<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:03.870> a

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
00 make sure the space is and a

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.560 
00 make sure the space is and a
semicolon<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:05.160> what<00:06:05.460> it's<00:06:05.580> going<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.730> do<00:06:06.000> is

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
semicolon and what it's going to do is

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.210 
semicolon and what it's going to do is
it's<00:06:06.720> going<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.020> flip<00:06:07.350> this<00:06:07.740> one<00:06:07.800> right<00:06:08.160> here

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
it's going to flip this one right here

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.450 
it's going to flip this one right here
because<00:06:09.180> if<00:06:09.420> I<00:06:09.540> notice<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.590> Z's<00:06:10.860> are<00:06:11.070> facing

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
because if I notice the Z's are facing

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.970 
because if I notice the Z's are facing
this<00:06:11.640> direction<00:06:11.850> they're<00:06:12.420> facing<00:06:12.630> to<00:06:13.620> our

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
this direction they're facing to our

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.860 
this direction they're facing to our
left<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:16.310> this<00:06:17.310> one<00:06:17.700> knee<00:06:18.120> joint<00:06:18.420> here<00:06:18.690> is

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
left and this one knee joint here is

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.600 
left and this one knee joint here is
facing<00:06:19.320> to<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:19.470> right<00:06:19.590> so<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.040> need<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.340> rotate

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
facing to the right so I need to rotate

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.640 
facing to the right so I need to rotate
that<00:06:20.940> pile<00:06:21.180> hundred<00:06:21.510> eighty<00:06:21.600> degrees<00:06:21.660> so<00:06:22.530> this

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
that pile hundred eighty degrees so this

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.780 
that pile hundred eighty degrees so this
is<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.860> command<00:06:23.190> I'm<00:06:23.430> just<00:06:23.580> going<00:06:23.760> to

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
is the command I'm just going to

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.610 
is the command I'm just going to
highlight<00:06:24.060> it<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.390> press<00:06:24.510> enter<00:06:25.290> on<00:06:25.320> the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
highlight it and press enter on the

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.170 
highlight it and press enter on the
number<00:06:26.040> pad<00:06:26.400> not<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.390> other<00:06:28.050> enter<00:06:28.820> on<00:06:29.820> the

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
number pad not the other enter on the

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.570 
number pad not the other enter on the
middle<00:06:30.780> of<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:30.870> keyword<00:06:31.200> I<00:06:31.470> notice<00:06:32.280> that<00:06:32.430> the

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
middle of the keyword I notice that the

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.540 
middle of the keyword I notice that the
Z<00:06:32.760> is<00:06:32.910> now<00:06:33.060> pointing<00:06:33.360> in<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:34.050> right<00:06:34.200> direction

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
Z is now pointing in the right direction

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.970 
Z is now pointing in the right direction
failure<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.610> do<00:06:35.820> this<00:06:35.850> will<00:06:36.300> be<00:06:37.230> detrimental

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
failure to do this will be detrimental

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.750 
failure to do this will be detrimental
later<00:06:38.130> on

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
later on

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.480 
later on
when<00:06:38.910> you're<00:06:39.030> trying<00:06:39.180> to<00:06:40.070> rotates<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:41.280> things

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
when you're trying to rotates and things

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.490 
when you're trying to rotates and things
and<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:42.000> orientation<00:06:42.570> gets<00:06:42.750> mixed<00:06:42.930> mixed<00:06:43.380> up

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
and the orientation gets mixed mixed up

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.490 
and the orientation gets mixed mixed up
so<00:06:44.340> anyway<00:06:44.910> I'm<00:06:45.090> about<00:06:45.300> out<00:06:45.360> of<00:06:45.510> time<00:06:45.750> with

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
so anyway I'm about out of time with

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.430 
so anyway I'm about out of time with
that<00:06:46.650> so<00:06:46.920> I<00:06:47.400> will<00:06:48.150> catch<00:06:49.140> you<00:06:49.170> in<00:06:49.320> the<00:06:49.350> next

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
that so I will catch you in the next

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.770
