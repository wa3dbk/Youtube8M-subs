00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
sense so I'm kind of picking a few of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
sense so I'm kind of picking a few of
the<00:01:01.079> cheaper<00:01:01.440> ones<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.520> would

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the cheaper ones that you kind of would

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.920 
the cheaper ones that you kind of would
just<00:01:02.969> look<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.570> yeah<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.780> sure

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
just look at and think yeah I'm sure

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
just look at and think yeah I'm sure
he's<00:01:04.049> decent<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> game<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> reality

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
he's decent in the game when in reality

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.080 
he's decent in the game when in reality
they<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.360> absolute<00:01:07.110> monsters<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.939> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
they are absolute monsters so like I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
they are absolute monsters so like I
said<00:01:09.299> first<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.229> gotten<00:01:10.710> lawyer<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
said first up we have gotten lawyer and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.260 
said first up we have gotten lawyer and
I<00:01:11.250> guess<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> an

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I guess that's a little bit of an

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
I guess that's a little bit of an
exception<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.260> spoke<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.710> but
