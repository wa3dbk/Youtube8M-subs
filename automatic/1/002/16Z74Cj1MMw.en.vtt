guys how to tie braided line two mono
line<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.620> best<00:00:10.889> not<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.400> I've<00:00:11.519> found

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
line with the best not that I've found

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
line with the best not that I've found
so<00:00:12.030> far<00:00:14.000> first<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.240> take<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.599> leader<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> go

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
so far first you take your leader and go

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
so far first you take your leader and go
about<00:00:17.400> an<00:00:17.520> inch<00:00:17.760> down<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.930> fold<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.350> in

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
about an inch down and you fold it in

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.740 
about an inch down and you fold it in
half<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.900> create<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> loop<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
half and create a loop just like that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.630 
half and create a loop just like that
and<00:00:24.750> then<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.590> want<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.460> want

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and then what you want to do is you want

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480 
and then what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:26.699> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.910> pinch<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> down<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:28.490> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
to kind of pinch it down a little bit so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.200 
to kind of pinch it down a little bit so
you<00:00:29.550> create<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> nice<00:00:30.179> tight<00:00:30.570> loop<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you create a nice tight loop so you can

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.520 
you create a nice tight loop so you can
eventually<00:00:33.390> wrap<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.050> line<00:00:34.200> around<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
eventually wrap your line around it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.270 
eventually wrap your line around it
really<00:00:34.649> easily<00:00:35.899> then<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.930> take<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.649> braided

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
really easily then you take your braided

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.170 
really easily then you take your braided
line<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.670> put<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:38.940> through<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.360> loop

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
line you put it right through that loop

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.450 
line you put it right through that loop
pull<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.440> three<00:00:44.129> inches

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
pull it out a good you know three inches

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.389 
pull it out a good you know three inches
so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.120> something<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> work<00:00:45.510> with

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
so you have something to work with

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
so you have something to work with
then<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> want<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.809> want<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
then what you want to do is you want to
wrap<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.260> around<00:00:49.649> these<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.399> lines<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> F

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
wrap it around these two lines the F

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
wrap it around these two lines the F
right<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> fold<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.320> half<00:00:52.500> seven

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
right here that you fold in half seven

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
right here that you fold in half seven
times<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> wrap<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.449> braid<00:00:54.840> around

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
times you want to wrap that braid around

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.619 
times you want to wrap that braid around
there<00:00:55.260> seven<00:00:55.620> times<00:00:56.000> make<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
there seven times make sure and get it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:12.440 
there seven times make sure and get it
nice<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.870> tight

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.490 

seven<00:01:13.200> times<00:01:13.670> then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
seven times then you want to go back the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
seven times then you want to go back the
other<00:01:16.530> direction<00:01:17.000> overlapping<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
other direction overlapping what you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.679 
other direction overlapping what you
just<00:01:18.630> wrapped<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.939> cinch<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.360> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
just wrapped so I can cinch down on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.710 
just wrapped so I can cinch down on
itself<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.350> pull<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.649> tight

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
itself and you pull it tight

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
itself and you pull it tight
you<00:01:24.720> wrap<00:01:24.899> seven<00:01:25.560> times<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.250> direction

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you wrap seven times the other direction

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
you wrap seven times the other direction
as<00:01:26.970> well

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.740 

so<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.120> back<00:01:39.420> through

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so then you put it right back through

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.000 
so then you put it right back through
that<00:01:39.870> loop<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> went<00:01:40.650> through<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
that loop that you went through in the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.410 
that loop that you went through in the
beginning<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.880> where<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.360> your

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
beginning that's where you put your

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.730 
beginning that's where you put your
access<00:01:42.900> line<00:01:43.110> through<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.440> create

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
access line through so you create

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.530 
access line through so you create
something<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.160> like<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:50.540> when

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
something just like that and then when

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
something just like that and then when
you<00:01:51.630> pull<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> tight<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.040> cinch<00:01:53.340> down<00:01:53.460> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you pull it tight it will cinch down on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.180 
you pull it tight it will cinch down on
itself<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> create<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.250> nice<00:01:56.520> small<00:01:58.190> tight

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
itself and create a nice small tight

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.150 
itself and create a nice small tight
knot<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:01.410> pull<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> real

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
knot just like that you pull it real

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.260 
knot just like that you pull it real
nice<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.400> hard<00:02:02.790> make<00:02:03.210> sure<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> goes<00:02:03.600> down

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
nice and hard make sure it goes down

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.180 
nice and hard make sure it goes down
after<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> trim<00:02:06.570> both<00:02:06.900> edges<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.860> turn<00:02:08.070> out

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
after you trim both edges you turn out

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.800 
after you trim both edges you turn out
with<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.429> very<00:02:08.670> small<00:02:08.820> knot<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.660> can

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
with this very small knot that can

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.600 
with this very small knot that can
easily<00:02:09.989> slide<00:02:10.619> through<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> guides<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.459> your

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
easily slide through the guides of your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460 
easily slide through the guides of your
fishing<00:02:11.970> pole<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.050> nice<00:02:13.200> because

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
fishing pole and this is nice because

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170 
fishing pole and this is nice because
sometimes<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:15.000> longer

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
sometimes you can have a little longer

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.300 
sometimes you can have a little longer
leader<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.680> reel<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> right<00:02:17.190> through

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
leader so you can reel it right through

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.620 
leader so you can reel it right through
your<00:02:17.400> guides<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.880> cast<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.330> back<00:02:18.510> out

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
your guides and cast right back out
