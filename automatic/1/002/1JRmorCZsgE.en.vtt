cast<00:00:50.700> basically<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.600> thing<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
cast basically the one thing that is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.209 
cast basically the one thing that is
rolling<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.440> protoss<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.070> natural

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
rolling for protoss is that natural

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
rolling for protoss is that natural
secondary<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.789> really<00:00:54.000> wide<00:00:54.149> open<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
secondary is really wide open so the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
secondary is really wide open so the
early<00:00:55.050> June<00:00:55.289> pressure<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.860> pay<00:00:56.070> off<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
early June pressure can pay off but I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150 
early June pressure can pay off but I
still<00:00:57.300> feel<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.570> vultures<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> after

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
still feel like vultures kind of after

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
still feel like vultures kind of after
that<00:00:59.309> fact<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> taking<00:01:00.180> additional<00:01:00.359> base<00:01:00.719> for

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that fact and taking additional base for

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
that fact and taking additional base for
protoss<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.620> very<00:01:01.800> difficult<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.270> don't

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
protoss is very difficult so I don't

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.579 
protoss is very difficult so I don't
know<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.660> feels<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> margin<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.470> error

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
know it feels like the margin of error

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.620 
know it feels like the margin of error
in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> early<00:01:05.189> game<00:01:05.400> yes<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.600> very

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
in the early game yes that that's a very

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.010 
in the early game yes that that's a very
pressure<00:01:07.200> bowl<00:01:07.439> natural<00:01:07.830> secondary<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:09.780> at

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
pressure bowl natural secondary but at

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.690 
pressure bowl natural secondary but at
the<00:01:10.140> same<00:01:10.320> time<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.250> feels<00:01:11.549> like

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the same time I don't know feels like

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.039 
the same time I don't know feels like
Terran<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.180> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> sneak<00:01:12.510> things<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
Terran can kind of sneak things up I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.179 
Terran can kind of sneak things up I
almost<00:01:13.170> feel<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.409> Terran<00:01:13.799> would<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.040> better

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
almost feel like Terran would be better

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
almost feel like Terran would be better
off<00:01:14.280> opening<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.540> straight

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
off opening up with just straight

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
off opening up with just straight
vulture<00:01:16.080> drop<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> feel<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
vulture drop because I feel like this is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
vulture drop because I feel like this is
a<00:01:17.640> very<00:01:18.240> good<00:01:18.299> map<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.900> vulture<00:01:19.229> drop<00:01:19.470> just

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
a very good map for vulture drop just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
a very good map for vulture drop just
stick<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.549> base<00:01:20.729> vulture<00:01:21.090> drop

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
stick I don't know one base vulture drop

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
stick I don't know one base vulture drop
go<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.799> sky<00:01:23.070> decides<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
go from there let's see sky decides to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
go from there let's see sky decides to
roll<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> direction<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.659> feel<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.590> fast

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
roll that direction I feel like fast

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.320 
roll that direction I feel like fast
expansion<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.850> dangerous<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
expansion is just a dangerous way to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
expansion is just a dangerous way to
open<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> pretty<00:01:28.590> exposed

though just for the cast little power I

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.690 
though just for the cast little power I
have<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.769> feeling<00:02:19.860> he<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> open<00:02:20.519> up

10-15<00:02:21.000> gate<00:02:21.620> unfortunately<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
10-15 gate unfortunately I think you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.229

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
because it looks like sky high is going

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.860 
because it looks like sky high is going

to go front door seal I can't imagine

to go front door seal I can't imagine
that<00:02:28.290> well<00:02:28.530> see<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:28.950> sky<00:02:29.129> high<00:02:29.280> does<00:02:29.489> in<00:02:29.670> fact

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
that well see if sky high does in fact

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.460 
that well see if sky high does in fact
just<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.599> natural<00:02:30.959> fast<00:02:31.110> expansion

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
just go for that natural fast expansion

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.690 
just go for that natural fast expansion
that's<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.829> thing<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:31.980> does<00:02:32.190> frustrate<00:02:32.400> me

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that's one thing that does frustrate me

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.420 
that's one thing that does frustrate me

a second Sutton colony when they really

need it instead of like oh ok put down a
sudden<00:02:54.840> colony<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.260> yes<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.769> end<00:02:56.310> up<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.790> drone

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
sudden colony and yes I end up one drone

now and I'm still economically ahead
it's<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.459> put<00:03:02.609> down<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> extra<00:03:03.239> stuff

finds it how wow the brain with the wall

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.720 
finds it how wow the brain with the wall
hacks<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.769> think<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.280> because<00:04:08.489> of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
hacks and I think that is because of

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
hacks and I think that is because of
that<00:04:08.849> SUV<00:04:09.329> in<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.750> base<00:04:09.930> just<00:04:10.260> seeing<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
that SUV in the base just seeing the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.920 
that SUV in the base just seeing the
fact<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.120> yeah<00:04:12.120> he<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.690> didn't

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
fact that yeah he just didn't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.360 
fact that yeah he just didn't
legitimately<00:04:13.379> think<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.859> best<00:04:14.010> would<00:04:14.220> go

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
legitimately think that best would go

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.310 
legitimately think that best would go
one<00:04:14.549> base<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.060> fast<00:04:15.239> expansion<00:04:15.660> on<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> map

one base in the fast expansion on a map
like<00:04:16.500> this<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.489> looks<00:04:17.729> like<00:04:17.820> he's<00:04:18.150> still

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
like this and it looks like he's still

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.670 
like this and it looks like he's still

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
come back and do the proxy later looks

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.950 
come back and do the proxy later looks
like<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> chicken<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.599> zealot<00:04:39.840> now

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960

wandering out wanting to kill that

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.230 
wandering out wanting to kill that
marine<00:04:42.259> but<00:04:43.259> still<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.530> think<00:04:43.800> sky<00:04:44.220> high<00:04:44.430> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
marine but still I think sky high you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.460 
marine but still I think sky high you
know<00:04:45.330> that's<00:04:45.509> funny<00:04:45.659> because<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.960> said<00:04:46.349> that

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
know that's funny because I said that

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.809 
know that's funny because I said that
last<00:04:46.620> time<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.889> was<00:04:47.069> like<00:04:47.129> in<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.370> last<00:04:47.610> match

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
last time I was like in that last match

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.640 
last time I was like in that last match
oh<00:04:48.060> yeah<00:04:48.210> sky<00:04:48.539> high<00:04:48.690> if<00:04:48.840> he<00:04:48.960> sees<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.289> coming<00:04:49.319> he

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
oh yeah sky high if he sees it coming he

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.960 
oh yeah sky high if he sees it coming he
should<00:04:49.830> be<00:04:49.919> able<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.129> deal<00:04:50.250> with<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.460> yet<00:04:50.729> still

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
should be able to deal with it yet still

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.909 
should be able to deal with it yet still
the<00:04:51.210> Wraith<00:04:51.389> were<00:04:51.599> able<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.960> run<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.319> do<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.530> ton

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
the Wraith were able to run and do a ton

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.619 
the Wraith were able to run and do a ton
of<00:04:52.949> damage<00:04:53.250> he<00:04:53.789> was<00:04:53.940> able<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.210> make<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.419> up<00:04:54.509> with

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
of damage he was able to make it up with

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.510 
of damage he was able to make it up with
the<00:04:54.720> vulture<00:04:55.020> surrounding<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:55.620> maybe<00:04:56.220> he

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
the vulture surrounding so maybe he

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.649 
the vulture surrounding so maybe he
won't<00:04:56.639> be<00:04:56.789> able<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:57.000> adjust<00:04:57.240> with<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:57.389> but

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
won't be able to adjust with this but

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.230 
won't be able to adjust with this but
I've<00:04:57.870> got<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.169> imagine<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.770> he's<00:04:58.979> not<00:04:59.210> such<00:05:00.210> a

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
I've got to imagine that he's not such a

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240 
I've got to imagine that he's not such a
bad<00:05:00.449> player<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.930> seeing<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.470> proxy<00:05:01.949> go<00:05:02.069> up

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
bad player that seeing the proxy go up

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.010 
bad player that seeing the proxy go up
seeing<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.610> robotics<00:05:02.970> facility<00:05:03.120> being<00:05:03.960> built

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
seeing the robotics facility being built

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.110 
seeing the robotics facility being built
but<00:05:04.710> he<00:05:04.800> won't<00:05:05.099> do<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.220> finally<00:05:05.699> it<00:05:05.789> looks<00:05:05.819> like

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
but he won't do it finally it looks like

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.689 
but he won't do it finally it looks like
the<00:05:06.360> sixth<00:05:06.630> sent<00:05:06.900> from<00:05:07.770> best<00:05:08.069> also<00:05:08.490> kicking

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
the sixth sent from best also kicking

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.070 
the sixth sent from best also kicking
and<00:05:08.940> he's<00:05:09.030> able<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.240> run<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.569> finally<00:05:09.900> kill

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
and he's able to run and finally kill

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.200 
and he's able to run and finally kill
that<00:05:10.199> marine<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.699> looks<00:05:11.849> like<00:05:11.880> yeah<00:05:12.090> he's

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
that marine and it looks like yeah he's

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.790 
that marine and it looks like yeah he's
just<00:05:12.360> going<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.539> stick<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:13.020> gonna<00:05:13.560> build

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
just going to stick to it gonna build

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.959 
just going to stick to it gonna build
the<00:05:14.069> bill<00:05:15.060> did<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.300> location<00:05:15.979> and<00:05:16.979> maybe<00:05:17.699> if<00:05:17.849> he

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
the bill did it location and maybe if he

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.459 
the bill did it location and maybe if he
just<00:05:18.150> leaves<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:18.599> this<00:05:18.870> could<00:05:19.050> be<00:05:19.080> actually

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
just leaves it this could be actually

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:20.839 
just leaves it this could be actually
clever<00:05:19.680> leave<00:05:19.949> it<00:05:20.069> okay<00:05:20.310> he<00:05:20.370> is<00:05:20.460> doing<00:05:20.759> this

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
clever leave it okay he is doing this

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.760 
clever leave it okay he is doing this
he's<00:05:21.090> going<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.330> leave<00:05:21.509> it<00:05:21.659> go<00:05:22.319> for<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.620> natural

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
he's going to leave it go for a natural

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.830 
he's going to leave it go for a natural
expansion<00:05:23.219> instead<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:23.969> go<00:05:24.270> observers

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
expansion instead and go observers

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.990 
expansion instead and go observers
instead<00:05:25.229> what<00:05:26.190> he's<00:05:26.310> gonna<00:05:26.520> need<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:26.849> follow

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
instead what he's gonna need to follow

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.510 
instead what he's gonna need to follow
this<00:05:27.150> up<00:05:27.330> with<00:05:27.389> though<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.530> lot<00:05:28.949> of<00:05:29.159> dragoons

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
this up with though is a lot of dragoons

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.610 
this up with though is a lot of dragoons
to<00:05:30.240> play<00:05:30.449> map<00:05:30.659> control<00:05:31.020> because<00:05:31.259> it's<00:05:31.440> going

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
to play map control because it's going

as sky-high has this natural secondary

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.480 
as sky-high has this natural secondary
basically<00:05:39.900> sealed<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.349> solid<00:05:40.710> basically<00:05:41.460> I

feel like best will be in a lot of

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.180 
feel like best will be in a lot of
trouble<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:43.289> that's<00:05:43.469> a<00:05:43.590> very<00:05:43.620> interesting

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
trouble and that's a very interesting

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.640 
trouble and that's a very interesting
wall<00:05:44.610> very<00:05:45.090> very<00:05:45.719> hard<00:05:45.960> to<00:05:46.080> defend<00:05:46.289> ential

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
wall very very hard to defend ential

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.309 
wall very very hard to defend ential
secondary<00:05:47.099> but<00:05:47.880> yeah<00:05:48.240> that's<00:05:48.419> that's<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.990> crazy

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
secondary but yeah that's that's a crazy

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.260 
secondary but yeah that's that's a crazy
wall<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:50.490> that's<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.729> thing<00:05:50.759> is<00:05:51.029> I<00:05:51.210> don't

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
wall but that's the thing is I don't

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.610 
wall but that's the thing is I don't
think<00:05:51.419> there's<00:05:51.690> going<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:51.930> be<00:05:51.960> anything<00:05:52.289> best

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
think there's going to be anything best

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.170 
think there's going to be anything best
can<00:05:52.800> do<00:05:52.889> to<00:05:53.009> defend<00:05:53.250> his<00:05:53.460> natural<00:05:53.789> secondary

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
can do to defend his natural secondary

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.300 
can do to defend his natural secondary
and<00:05:54.360> his<00:05:54.479> third<00:05:54.659> simultaneously<00:05:55.319> once<00:05:56.039> sky

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
and his third simultaneously once sky

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.709 
and his third simultaneously once sky
eyes<00:05:56.490> in<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.729> position<00:05:56.940> where<00:05:57.120> he<00:05:57.330> can<00:05:57.419> kind<00:05:57.599> of

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
eyes in a position where he can kind of

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.290 
eyes in a position where he can kind of
roll<00:05:57.900> out<00:05:58.080> so<00:05:58.979> let's<00:05:59.639> see<00:05:59.759> if<00:05:59.880> you<00:06:00.000> can<00:06:00.029> get

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
roll out so let's see if you can get

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.540 
roll out so let's see if you can get
enough<00:06:00.630> jus<00:06:00.840> goons<00:06:01.110> that<00:06:01.889> produced<00:06:02.190> two<00:06:02.340> just

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
enough jus goons that produced two just

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.969 
enough jus goons that produced two just
absolutely<00:06:03.080> kind<00:06:04.080> of<00:06:04.110> get<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.259> death<00:06:04.529> throttle

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
absolutely kind of get a death throttle

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.469 
absolutely kind of get a death throttle
on<00:06:05.159> Oh<00:06:05.430> unfortunately<00:06:06.090> looks<00:06:06.240> like<00:06:06.360> he's

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
on Oh unfortunately looks like he's

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.330 
on Oh unfortunately looks like he's
going<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.690> go<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:07.080> gate<00:06:07.889> and<00:06:08.009> try<00:06:08.099> to<00:06:08.159> get<00:06:08.310> a

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
going to go to gate and try to get a

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.649 
going to go to gate and try to get a
quick<00:06:08.520> third<00:06:08.849> base<00:06:09.060> which<00:06:09.270> I<00:06:09.389> almost<00:06:09.509> feel

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
quick third base which I almost feel

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.420 
quick third base which I almost feel
like<00:06:09.719> he's<00:06:10.319> playing<00:06:10.560> into<00:06:10.740> sky<00:06:10.949> eyes<00:06:11.130> hands

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
like he's playing into sky eyes hands

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.860 
like he's playing into sky eyes hands
let's<00:06:11.639> heal<00:06:11.759> sky-high<00:06:12.029> decides<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.599> play<00:06:12.719> this

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
let's heal sky-high decides to play this

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.350 
let's heal sky-high decides to play this
as<00:06:13.020> well<00:06:13.699> critically<00:06:14.699> though<00:06:14.819> he<00:06:15.000> is<00:06:15.120> going<00:06:15.270> to

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
as well critically though he is going to

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.730 
as well critically though he is going to
end<00:06:15.479> up<00:06:15.509> a<00:06:15.659> little<00:06:15.990> bit<00:06:16.110> ahead<00:06:16.229> just<00:06:16.529> because

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
end up a little bit ahead just because

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.499 
end up a little bit ahead just because
of<00:06:16.860> all<00:06:16.949> the<00:06:17.039> turrets<00:06:17.250> this<00:06:17.880> guy<00:06:18.060> is<00:06:18.120> like<00:06:18.360> okay

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
of all the turrets this guy is like okay

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.809 
of all the turrets this guy is like okay
well<00:06:18.930> I<00:06:18.960> saw<00:06:19.229> the<00:06:19.289> proxy<00:06:19.740> i<00:06:19.979> assume<00:06:20.370> he's<00:06:20.400> going

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
well I saw the proxy i assume he's going

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.189 
well I saw the proxy i assume he's going
to<00:06:20.880> be<00:06:20.969> going<00:06:21.270> for<00:06:21.419> proxy<00:06:21.750> i<00:06:21.779> got<00:06:21.990> a<00:06:22.020> place

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
to be going for proxy i got a place

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
to be going for proxy i got a place
they've<00:06:22.380> got<00:06:22.529> to<00:06:22.620> build<00:06:22.740> a<00:06:22.800> lot<00:06:22.919> of<00:06:23.009> turrets

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
they've got to build a lot of turrets

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.879 
they've got to build a lot of turrets
best<00:06:23.520> might<00:06:23.789> lose<00:06:24.419> his<00:06:24.569> observer<00:06:25.110> okay<00:06:25.620> just

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
best might lose his observer okay just

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.580 
best might lose his observer okay just
barely<00:06:26.569> manages<00:06:27.569> think<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:28.139> observer<00:06:28.440> out

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
barely manages think that observer out

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.830 
barely manages think that observer out
he's<00:06:28.770> got<00:06:28.889> another<00:06:29.039> observer<00:06:29.840> wandering

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
he's got another observer wandering

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.079 
he's got another observer wandering
around<00:06:30.930> the<00:06:31.139> front<00:06:31.289> here<00:06:31.500> but<00:06:32.159> but<00:06:32.849> yeah<00:06:33.000> he

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
around the front here but but yeah he

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.490 
around the front here but but yeah he
had<00:06:33.270> to<00:06:33.360> produce<00:06:33.509> a<00:06:33.690> couple<00:06:33.960> turrets<00:06:34.229> didn't

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
had to produce a couple turrets didn't

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.719 
had to produce a couple turrets didn't
overcome<00:06:34.889> it<00:06:35.009> on<00:06:35.099> turrets<00:06:35.370> i<00:06:35.430> think<00:06:35.550> he<00:06:35.610> only

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
overcome it on turrets i think he only

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:36.080 
overcome it on turrets i think he only
built

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
built

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.600 
built
three<00:06:36.419> here<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:37.650> kind<00:06:37.830> of<00:06:37.889> deal<00:06:38.070> with<00:06:38.190> this<00:06:38.340> and

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
three here to kind of deal with this and

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.610 
three here to kind of deal with this and
so<00:06:39.120> yeah<00:06:39.510> it<00:06:39.600> looks<00:06:39.750> like<00:06:39.810> best<00:06:40.080> is<00:06:40.230> setting<00:06:40.530> up

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
so yeah it looks like best is setting up

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.070 
so yeah it looks like best is setting up
to<00:06:40.770> take<00:06:40.980> that<00:06:41.220> that<00:06:41.970> his<00:06:42.270> third<00:06:42.540> base<00:06:42.750> at<00:06:43.020> the

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
to take that that his third base at the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.189 
to take that that his third base at the
ten<00:06:43.830> o'clock<00:06:44.010> position<00:06:44.550> and<00:06:44.870> again<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:45.900> almost

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
ten o'clock position and again I almost

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.020 
ten o'clock position and again I almost
he's<00:06:46.650> going<00:06:46.800> to<00:06:46.860> try<00:06:46.949> to<00:06:46.979> put<00:06:47.430> up<00:06:47.520> a<00:06:47.639> pile<00:06:47.880> on

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
he's going to try to put up a pile on

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.939 
he's going to try to put up a pile on
wall<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.870> try<00:06:48.900> to<00:06:49.110> defend<00:06:49.440> that<00:06:49.620> but<00:06:49.830> I<00:06:49.860> think

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 
wall to try to defend that but I think

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:51.890 
wall to try to defend that but I think
sky<00:06:50.460> high<00:06:50.699> is<00:06:50.760> still<00:06:51.330> going<00:06:51.479> to<00:06:51.540> be<00:06:51.660> able<00:06:51.690> to

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
sky high is still going to be able to

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.110 
sky high is still going to be able to
kind<00:06:52.110> of<00:06:52.169> roll<00:06:52.560> up<00:06:52.740> there<00:06:52.919> and<00:06:53.040> I<00:06:53.340> don't<00:06:54.000> feel

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
kind of roll up there and I don't feel

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.520 
kind of roll up there and I don't feel
like<00:06:54.240> you<00:06:54.540> can<00:06:54.570> just<00:06:54.720> play<00:06:54.990> with<00:06:55.139> jus<00:06:55.320> goons

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
like you can just play with jus goons

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.379 
like you can just play with jus goons
and<00:06:55.770> play<00:06:55.949> defensively<00:06:56.430> here<00:06:56.790> let's<00:06:57.210> see<00:06:57.330> if

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
and play defensively here let's see if

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.600 
and play defensively here let's see if
sky-high<00:06:57.600> puts<00:06:57.990> down<00:06:58.110> a<00:06:58.139> star<00:06:58.440> port<00:06:58.680> now<00:06:58.889> and

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
sky-high puts down a star port now and

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.430 
sky-high puts down a star port now and
decides<00:06:59.940> to<00:07:00.180> get<00:07:00.300> some<00:07:00.540> drops<00:07:00.810> going<00:07:01.169> to

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
decides to get some drops going to

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.530 
decides to get some drops going to
because<00:07:02.040> again<00:07:02.729> I<00:07:02.760> feel<00:07:03.000> like<00:07:03.060> this<00:07:03.240> is<00:07:03.360> a<00:07:03.389> very

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
because again I feel like this is a very

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.250 
because again I feel like this is a very
droppable<00:07:03.990> map<00:07:04.290> I<00:07:04.500> think<00:07:04.949> it's<00:07:05.250> worthwhile

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
droppable map I think it's worthwhile

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.510 
droppable map I think it's worthwhile
let's<00:07:07.260> see<00:07:07.410> how<00:07:07.470> best<00:07:07.710> kind<00:07:07.889> of<00:07:07.979> adjusts<00:07:08.310> to<00:07:08.370> do

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
let's see how best kind of adjusts to do

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.750 
let's see how best kind of adjusts to do
that<00:07:08.820> too<00:07:09.120> I<00:07:09.150> mean<00:07:09.450> he<00:07:09.600> just<00:07:09.630> needs<00:07:09.990> to<00:07:10.139> somehow

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
that too I mean he just needs to somehow

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.400 
that too I mean he just needs to somehow
maintain<00:07:11.760> map<00:07:11.970> control<00:07:12.330> on<00:07:12.510> this<00:07:12.690> but<00:07:12.960> it<00:07:13.320> just

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
maintain map control on this but it just

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.570 
maintain map control on this but it just
going<00:07:13.560> to<00:07:13.620> be<00:07:13.710> difficult<00:07:13.860> to<00:07:14.040> do<00:07:14.220> so<00:07:14.250> for

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
going to be difficult to do so for

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.120 
going to be difficult to do so for
gateways<00:07:14.910> planted<00:07:15.410> those<00:07:16.410> have<00:07:16.620> observers<00:07:16.950> on

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
gateways planted those have observers on

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.740 
gateways planted those have observers on
the<00:07:17.220> field<00:07:17.400> he<00:07:17.820> is<00:07:17.910> going<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.120> put<00:07:18.300> able<00:07:18.690> to

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
the field he is going to put able to

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.940 
the field he is going to put able to
produce<00:07:18.900> a<00:07:19.110> lot<00:07:19.260> of<00:07:19.290> dragoons<00:07:19.620> and<00:07:19.740> it<00:07:19.800> looks

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
produce a lot of dragoons and it looks

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.800 
produce a lot of dragoons and it looks
like<00:07:20.010> he<00:07:20.250> has<00:07:20.490> managed<00:07:20.940> to<00:07:21.060> kind<00:07:21.210> of<00:07:21.300> press

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
like he has managed to kind of press

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.409 
like he has managed to kind of press
forward<00:07:22.110> and<00:07:22.229> skiff<00:07:22.530> out<00:07:22.650> I<00:07:23.010> i'll<00:07:23.580> use<00:07:23.790> that<00:07:23.970> as

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 
forward and skiff out I i'll use that as

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:26.810 
forward and skiff out I i'll use that as
an<00:07:24.540> official<00:07:24.870> term<00:07:25.020> now<00:07:25.169> skiff<00:07:25.700> before<00:07:26.700> the
