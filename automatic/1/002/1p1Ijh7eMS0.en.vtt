were<00:02:01.409> working<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.670> great<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.240> concrete

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
were working with not great for concrete

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.050 
were working with not great for concrete
work<00:02:03.829> not<00:02:04.829> great<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.219> digging<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.700> you'll<00:02:05.880> see

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
work not great for digging as you'll see

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.810 
work not great for digging as you'll see
we<00:02:06.299> actually

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
we actually

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820 
we actually
and<00:02:06.970> getting<00:02:07.510> two<00:02:07.690> shovels<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.410> buddy<00:02:08.649> to

and getting two shovels and a buddy to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.230 
and getting two shovels and a buddy to
help<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.130> if<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.310> can<00:02:09.550> we<00:02:09.789> did<00:02:09.940> this<00:02:10.060> with

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
help you if you can we did this with

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.900 
help you if you can we did this with
three<00:02:10.539> people<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:12.160> we're<00:02:12.280> doing<00:02:12.490> now<00:02:12.640> is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
three people what we're doing now is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.750 
three people what we're doing now is
measuring<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.140> total<00:02:14.980> diameter<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
measuring the total diameter of the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
measuring the total diameter of the
whole<00:02:15.910> work<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.209> day<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.959> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
whole work in a day so it's going to be

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.710 
whole work in a day so it's going to be
four<00:02:17.650> feet<00:02:17.890> eight<00:02:18.130> inches<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:18.940> diameter<00:02:19.240> and

four feet eight inches in diameter and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.500 
four feet eight inches in diameter and
it's<00:02:20.110> going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.410> six<00:02:20.650> inches<00:02:20.830> deep<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
it's going to be six inches deep the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.000 
it's going to be six inches deep the
concrete<00:02:22.510> foundation<00:02:22.780> will<00:02:23.320> be<00:02:23.440> completely

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
concrete foundation will be completely

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.130 
concrete foundation will be completely
under<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.700> ground<00:02:25.000> level<00:02:25.510> okay

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
under the ground level okay

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.840 
under the ground level okay
and<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.709> hole<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.190> be<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.580> bit

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
and the hole is going to be a little bit

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.780 
and the hole is going to be a little bit
wider<00:02:28.270> than<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.959> total<00:02:29.530> width<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.400> entire

four foot six inch wide brick wall that
surrounds<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.570> burning<00:02:40.930> area<00:02:41.230> there's<00:02:41.709> your

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
surrounds that burning area there's your

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.880 
surrounds that burning area there's your
finished<00:02:42.370> hole<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:44.350> can<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:44.650> we're

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
finished hole and you can see we're

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.460 
finished hole and you can see we're
ready<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.280> start<00:02:45.520> creating<00:02:46.450> our<00:02:46.660> mold<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.380> our

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
ready to start creating our mold for our

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.120 
ready to start creating our mold for our
concrete<00:02:47.890> foundation<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.680> after<00:02:50.890> you're<00:02:51.010> done

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
concrete foundation so after you're done

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.150 
concrete foundation so after you're done
with<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> hole<00:02:51.640> what<00:02:52.300> did<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:53.620> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
with the hole what did you have to do to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.180 
with the hole what did you have to do to
establish<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.060> form<00:02:55.420> for<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.930> concrete<00:02:56.320> well

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
establish the form for the concrete well

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.520 
establish the form for the concrete well
it<00:02:57.580> honestly<00:02:58.480> took<00:02:58.750> us<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:59.019> little<00:02:59.140> while<00:02:59.260> to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it honestly took us a little while to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
it honestly took us a little while to
figure<00:02:59.709> out<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.220> best<00:03:00.400> way<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.670> create<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
figure out the best way to create the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.290 
figure out the best way to create the
shape<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> form<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.489> aluminum

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
shape for the form for that aluminum

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.690 
shape for the form for that aluminum
sheeting<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.720> fit<00:03:05.080> around<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.590> circle<00:03:06.010> there

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
sheeting to fit around a circle there

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.120 
sheeting to fit around a circle there
you<00:03:06.850> can<00:03:06.970> see<00:03:07.180> what<00:03:07.330> we<00:03:07.450> decided<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.870> do<00:03:08.110> took<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
you can see what we decided to do took a

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.800 
you can see what we decided to do took a
center<00:03:09.430> stake<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.030> then<00:03:10.120> measured<00:03:10.450> out<00:03:10.570> eight

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
center stake and then measured out eight

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.600 
center stake and then measured out eight
stakes<00:03:11.170> all<00:03:11.380> around<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.890> each<00:03:12.070> one<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.489> half

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
stakes all around it each one and a half

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.460 
stakes all around it each one and a half
feet<00:03:12.850> from<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> center<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.930> gives<00:03:14.170> us<00:03:14.290> a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
feet from the center so that gives us a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.830 
feet from the center so that gives us a
rough<00:03:14.950> estimate<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:16.090> three-foot<00:03:16.630> diameter

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
rough estimate of a three-foot diameter

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.920 
rough estimate of a three-foot diameter
circle<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.709> then<00:03:18.580> for<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.910> outer<00:03:19.090> circle<00:03:19.690> it

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
circle and then for the outer circle it

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.280 
circle and then for the outer circle it
only<00:03:20.380> needed<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.510> slightly<00:03:22.510> wider<00:03:22.870> so

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
only needed to be a slightly wider so

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.740 
only needed to be a slightly wider so
just<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.829> bricks<00:03:24.130> length<00:03:24.430> wider<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.329> we<00:03:25.540> use

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
just a bricks length wider so we use

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.479 
just a bricks length wider so we use
bricks<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.380> measure<00:03:26.590> out<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.950> stakes<00:03:27.220> to

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
bricks to measure out the stakes to

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.060 
bricks to measure out the stakes to
shape<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.970> outer<00:03:28.269> circle<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.680> gives<00:03:29.950> us

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
shape that outer circle so that gives us

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.860 
shape that outer circle so that gives us
an<00:03:30.250> inner<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.760> an<00:03:30.850> outer<00:03:30.910> limit<00:03:31.420> for<00:03:31.840> a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
an inner and an outer limit for a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.270 
an inner and an outer limit for a
concrete<00:03:33.570> after<00:03:34.570> you've<00:03:35.110> made<00:03:35.500> your<00:03:35.560> mold<00:03:36.070> the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
concrete after you've made your mold the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.720 
concrete after you've made your mold the
next<00:03:36.579> step<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:37.030> just<00:03:37.390> pour<00:03:37.870> out<00:03:38.049> your<00:03:38.230> concrete

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
next step is just pour out your concrete

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.160 
next step is just pour out your concrete
that's<00:03:39.730> right<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.329> now<00:03:40.630> we're<00:03:40.810> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.959> mix

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
that's right so now we're going to mix

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.080 
that's right so now we're going to mix
some<00:03:41.290> concrete<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.980> as<00:03:42.130> JT<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.610> doing<00:03:42.940> now

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
some concrete just as JT is doing now

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.690 
some concrete just as JT is doing now
and<00:03:43.420> as<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.500> can<00:03:44.620> see<00:03:44.680> he's<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.100> little<00:03:45.190> bit<00:03:45.489> dry

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
and as you can see he's a little bit dry

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.300 
and as you can see he's a little bit dry
there<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.150> want<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.570> have<00:03:46.720> basically<00:03:47.140> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
there you want it to have basically a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.220 
there you want it to have basically a
muddy<00:03:48.310> consistency<00:03:49.150> when<00:03:49.390> before<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.989> pour

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
muddy consistency when before you pour

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.080 
muddy consistency when before you pour
so<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:50.829> coming<00:03:51.130> over<00:03:51.340> I'm<00:03:51.489> going<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.700> try<00:03:52.060> to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
so I'm coming over I'm going to try to

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.259 
so I'm coming over I'm going to try to
apply<00:03:52.299> some<00:03:52.480> water<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.290> wheelbarrow<00:03:53.530> and

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.930 

what<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.420> really<00:03:58.720> want<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.079> do<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.670> not<00:04:00.670> miss

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
what you really want to do is not miss

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.520 
what you really want to do is not miss
the<00:04:01.120> wheelbarrow<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.840> did<00:04:02.079> spray<00:04:02.410> it

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
the wheelbarrow like I did spray it

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.170 
the wheelbarrow like I did spray it
right<00:04:02.680> into<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.070> wheelbarrow<00:04:03.250> yeah<00:04:03.910> just

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
right into the wheelbarrow yeah just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.949 
right into the wheelbarrow yeah just
like<00:04:04.299> that

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
like that

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.470 
like that
don't<00:04:06.950> come<00:04:07.069> in<00:04:07.189> here<00:04:07.219> okay<00:04:07.939> you<00:04:08.180> see<00:04:08.359> we're

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
don't come in here okay you see we're

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.809 
don't come in here okay you see we're
putting<00:04:08.659> bricks<00:04:08.989> around<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.439> edge<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:10.579> that

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
putting bricks around this edge so that

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.030 
putting bricks around this edge so that
this<00:04:11.239> framing<00:04:11.719> for<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.900> concrete<00:04:12.469> doesn't

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
this framing for the concrete doesn't

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.550 
this framing for the concrete doesn't
seep<00:04:13.370> into<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.849> and<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.780> starts<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:15.200> interrupt

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
seep into it and it starts to interrupt

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.310 
seep into it and it starts to interrupt
the<00:04:15.820> overall<00:04:16.820> shape<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.389> fireman<00:04:18.229> because

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
the overall shape of the fireman because

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.430 
the overall shape of the fireman because
really<00:04:19.100> even<00:04:19.579> if<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.019> only<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.109> little<00:04:21.350> bit

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
really even if it's on only a little bit

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.320 
really even if it's on only a little bit
off<00:04:21.560> aesthetically<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.820> really<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:23.300> be

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
off aesthetically it really can be

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.710 
off aesthetically it really can be
damaged<00:04:24.430> by<00:04:25.430> putting<00:04:25.729> these<00:04:25.789> bricks<00:04:26.150> we're

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
damaged by putting these bricks we're

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.510 
damaged by putting these bricks we're
trying<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> maintain<00:04:27.289> this<00:04:27.889> circular<00:04:28.370> image

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
trying to maintain this circular image

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.120 
trying to maintain this circular image
where<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.570> strain<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.810> concrete<00:04:30.350> is<00:04:30.500> uniform

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
where the strain of concrete is uniform

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.900 
where the strain of concrete is uniform
as<00:04:31.250> possible<00:04:31.750> really<00:04:32.750> helps<00:04:33.020> with<00:04:33.139> you<00:04:33.259> a<00:04:33.289> roll

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
as possible really helps with you a roll

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.640 
as possible really helps with you a roll
appearance<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.210> at<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.449> end<00:04:35.479> yeah<00:04:36.199> what<00:04:36.410> JT

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
appearance of it at the end yeah what JT

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.589 
appearance of it at the end yeah what JT
said<00:04:37.009> it's<00:04:37.430> little<00:04:37.759> stuff<00:04:37.970> like<00:04:38.030> that<00:04:38.360> that

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
said it's little stuff like that that

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.820 
said it's little stuff like that that
really<00:04:39.410> helps<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.610> overall<00:04:40.880> project<00:04:41.120> here

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
really helps in the overall project here

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.409 
really helps in the overall project here
but<00:04:42.830> it's<00:04:42.979> not<00:04:43.160> as<00:04:43.400> wet<00:04:43.610> as<00:04:43.639> it<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.030> over<00:04:44.270> there

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
but it's not as wet as it is over there

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.990 
but it's not as wet as it is over there
it<00:04:44.630> won't<00:04:44.780> settle<00:04:45.229> all<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.590> way<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.580> we're

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
it won't settle all the way so we're

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.300 
it won't settle all the way so we're
probably<00:04:47.150> going<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.449> have<00:04:47.509> to<00:04:47.750> use<00:04:48.070> one<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.099> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
probably going to have to use one of the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.370 
probably going to have to use one of the
stakes<00:04:49.610> from<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.419> inside<00:04:50.690> like<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:50.930> middle

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
stakes from the inside like that middle

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.060 
stakes from the inside like that middle
one<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.949> jam<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.460> in<00:04:53.020> all<00:04:54.020> through<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.919> get

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
one and jam it in all through it to get

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.529 
one and jam it in all through it to get
rid<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.310> these<00:04:55.490> air<00:04:55.759> bubbles<00:04:55.940> otherwise

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
rid of these air bubbles otherwise

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.510 
rid of these air bubbles otherwise
you're<00:04:57.229> going<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.380> end<00:04:57.440> up<00:04:57.620> with<00:04:57.800> pockets<00:04:58.310> in

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
you're going to end up with pockets in

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.700 
you're going to end up with pockets in
the<00:04:59.210> concrete<00:04:59.539> and<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.960> never<00:05:00.139> want<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:00.470> in

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
the concrete and you never want that in

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.650 
the concrete and you never want that in
the<00:05:00.770> foundation<00:05:01.340> because<00:05:02.030> hot<00:05:02.900> air<00:05:02.930> expands

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
the foundation because hot air expands

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.510 
the foundation because hot air expands
here<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.780> can<00:05:05.900> see<00:05:06.259> JT<00:05:06.530> doing<00:05:06.979> exactly<00:05:07.340> what

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
here you can see JT doing exactly what

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.420 
here you can see JT doing exactly what
he<00:05:07.610> was<00:05:07.699> describing<00:05:07.820> to<00:05:08.449> you<00:05:09.010> shovel<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.099> out

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
he was describing to you shovel it out

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.300 
he was describing to you shovel it out
that<00:05:10.699> concrete<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.210> little<00:05:11.479> bit<00:05:11.599> with<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> stake

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
that concrete a little bit with a stake

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.740 
that concrete a little bit with a stake
to<00:05:13.310> get<00:05:13.550> rid<00:05:13.729> of<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.909> air<00:05:14.060> bubbles<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.630> make

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
to get rid of the air bubbles and make

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.110 
to get rid of the air bubbles and make
sure<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.020> entirely<00:05:15.409> settled<00:05:15.949> well<00:05:16.789> sign<00:05:17.090> off

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
sure it's entirely settled well sign off

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.510 
sure it's entirely settled well sign off
