this foot this keratin is expandable
when<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> foot<00:03:35.100> comes<00:03:35.340> down<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.820> will<00:03:35.940> expand

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
when the foot comes down it will expand

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.830 
when the foot comes down it will expand
like<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.170> which<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.530> handy<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:37.920> soft<00:03:38.310> coming

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
like this which is handy and soft coming

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.210 
like this which is handy and soft coming
because<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.140> means<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.560> there's<00:03:41.010> small

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
because it means that there's small

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.470 
because it means that there's small
bearing<00:03:41.670> surface<00:03:43.250> hidden<00:03:44.250> inside<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:45.090> camels

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.470 

okay<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:53.340> they're<00:03:53.610> almost<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.940> two<00:03:54.239> eggs

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
okay see they're almost like two eggs

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.870 
okay see they're almost like two eggs
these<00:03:54.870> pads<00:03:55.230> on<00:03:55.500> those<00:03:55.709> egg<00:03:55.980> shapes<00:03:56.310> I'm<00:03:56.670> sure

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
these pads on those egg shapes I'm sure

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.289 
these pads on those egg shapes I'm sure
they<00:03:57.269> do<00:04:01.160> they're<00:04:02.160> really<00:04:02.190> really<00:04:02.880> squishy

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
they do they're really really squishy

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.890 
they do they're really really squishy
they're<00:04:03.510> almost<00:04:03.630> like<00:04:03.780> silicon<00:04:04.290> implants<00:04:05.900> gel

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
they're almost like silicon implants gel

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.220 
they're almost like silicon implants gel
insoles<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:09.209> each<00:04:09.360> one<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.630> these<00:04:09.750> pads<00:04:10.019> is

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
insoles and each one of these pads is

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.580 
insoles and each one of these pads is
directly<00:04:10.920> underneath<00:04:11.370> one<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.970> mobile

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
directly underneath one of the mobile

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.640 
directly underneath one of the mobile
yep

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.380 

the<00:04:16.650> weight<00:04:16.890> of<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.250> camel<00:04:17.640> bears<00:04:17.940> down<00:04:18.329> on

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
the weight of the camel bears down on

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.010 
the weight of the camel bears down on
just<00:04:18.989> two<00:04:19.350> toes<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:20.100> each<00:04:20.280> foot

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
just two toes in each foot

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.170 
just two toes in each foot
underneath<00:04:23.020> each<00:04:23.290> one<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.130> cushion<00:04:24.700> this

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
underneath each one is a cushion this

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.450 
underneath each one is a cushion this
flattens<00:04:25.810> out<00:04:25.990> absorbing<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.950> shock<00:04:26.980> and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
flattens out absorbing the shock and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.960 
flattens out absorbing the shock and
balancing<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.510> animal<00:04:28.870> on<00:04:29.050> unsteady<00:04:29.680> ground

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.710 

we<00:04:33.970> can<00:04:34.120> see<00:04:34.360> it

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
we can see it

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.530 
we can see it
the<00:04:35.710> last<00:04:35.980> adaptation<00:04:36.910> we're<00:04:37.060> going<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.390> look

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
the last adaptation we're going to look

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.960 
the last adaptation we're going to look
at<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:38.170> how<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.500> legs<00:04:38.890> have<00:04:39.070> revolved<00:04:39.730> for

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
at is how the legs have revolved for

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:47.760 
at is how the legs have revolved for
long<00:04:40.210> distance<00:04:40.870> desert<00:04:41.350> travel<00:04:44.880> okay<00:04:46.710> okay<00:04:47.710> so

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
long distance desert travel okay okay so

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.910 
long distance desert travel okay okay so
now<00:04:48.330> we<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.450> see<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.780> Achilles<00:04:50.290> tendon<00:04:50.320> here

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
now we can see the Achilles tendon here

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.070 
now we can see the Achilles tendon here
this<00:04:51.160> huge<00:04:51.670> great<00:04:52.500> tendon<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:54.070> pretty

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
this huge great tendon it's pretty

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.330 
this huge great tendon it's pretty
movable<00:04:56.080> now<00:04:56.230> not<00:04:56.470> much<00:04:56.590> tension<00:04:56.890> on<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.130> if

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
movable now not much tension on it if

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.520 
movable now not much tension on it if
you<00:04:57.460> start<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.880> flex<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.270> joint<00:05:01.530> it's

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
you start to flex that joint it's

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.600 
you start to flex that joint it's
actually<00:05:02.860> quite<00:05:03.070> springy

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
actually quite springy

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.220 
actually quite springy
okay<00:05:03.850> so<00:05:03.910> just<00:05:04.210> bring<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:04.510> bring<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.750> back<00:05:04.960> joy

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
okay so just bring it bring it back joy

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.100 
okay so just bring it bring it back joy
from<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:06.310> full<00:05:06.520> flexion<00:05:06.820> that's<00:05:07.300> really<00:05:07.870> taut

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
from to full flexion that's really taut

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.320 
from to full flexion that's really taut
now<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.560> Achilles<00:05:08.860> tendon<00:05:09.280> down<00:05:09.460> here<00:05:09.730> so

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
now that Achilles tendon down here so

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.070 
now that Achilles tendon down here so
lots<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.750> energy<00:05:11.140> stored<00:05:11.440> in<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.490> let<00:05:12.640> go

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
lots of energy stored in that and let go

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.990 
lots of energy stored in that and let go
Wow<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:17.620> incredibly<00:05:18.250> strong<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.790> at<00:05:18.880> this

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
Wow it's incredibly strong it at this

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.730 
Wow it's incredibly strong it at this
kind<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.270> rubber<00:05:19.600> band<00:05:19.900> anatomy<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.680> the

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
kind of rubber band anatomy and the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.250 
kind of rubber band anatomy and the
camels<00:05:21.130> leg<00:05:21.340> is<00:05:21.550> what<00:05:21.730> helps<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.570> save<00:05:22.930> energy

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
camels leg is what helps it save energy

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.890 
camels leg is what helps it save energy
when<00:05:23.710> it's<00:05:24.190> wandering<00:05:24.760> around<00:05:24.880> in<00:05:25.690> its

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
when it's wandering around in its

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.690 
when it's wandering around in its
environment<00:05:26.230> it's<00:05:26.950> extraordinary

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
environment it's extraordinary

by storing energy in leg tendons the

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.899 
by storing energy in leg tendons the
camel<00:05:39.239> can<00:05:39.419> save<00:05:39.719> almost<00:05:40.139> half<00:05:40.769> the<00:05:41.099> work<00:05:41.309> that

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
camel can save almost half the work that

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.609 
camel can save almost half the work that
the<00:05:42.059> muscles<00:05:42.449> would<00:05:42.659> have<00:05:42.839> to<00:05:43.049> do<00:05:43.199> when<00:05:43.469> it's

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:43.619 
the muscles would have to do when it's
