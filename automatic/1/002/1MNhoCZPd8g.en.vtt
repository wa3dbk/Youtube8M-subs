00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
protectors nowadays I think that the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.500 
protectors nowadays I think that the
majority<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.519> people<00:03:51.700> when<00:03:52.209> they're<00:03:52.359> looking

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
majority of people when they're looking

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.479 
majority of people when they're looking
for<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.840> good<00:03:52.959> recipe<00:03:53.260> they<00:03:53.980> go<00:03:54.100> online<00:03:54.280> and

for a good recipe they go online and

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.039 
for a good recipe they go online and
they<00:03:54.760> print<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.180> out<00:03:55.299> so<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:56.019> way<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:57.220> stays

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
they print it out so this way it stays

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.910 
they print it out so this way it stays
half<00:03:59.049> way<00:03:59.549> readable<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.959> page<00:04:02.410> protector
