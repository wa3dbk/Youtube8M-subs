00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.000
 ah 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.970
 in the year 2005 but there I started 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.270
 work with the animal world veterinary 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.539
 and there I would pick up in an impromptu 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.840
 social cost and there I met more people 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.180
 that did the same and the 2010 know them 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.180
 to the boys and so was born little legs 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.500
 We work with own resources 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.149
 our time and the animals 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 we have in our house in the middle 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.170
 our families are not hostels 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.449
 because many people gave us threats and a 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.729
 dog collects what I have in my car no longer 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.250
 He wants it where I take it, and neither does 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.379
 is that they call us because there is a dog and 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.670
 we go and we pick it up because we 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.239
 we rescued in the mean of another 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 possibility 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.960
 we promote adoptions very much in the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.610
 page because the more they adopt more 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.610
 space we have for other brothers 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.880
 for example in my case I do not have 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.829
 dogs at home because I can not have them 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.270
 and I will not have a dog that you're 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.009
 sick because I can not take care of him 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.319
 this is what I do is help in the 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.920
 campaign I come to the marches I come to the 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.810
 events I do not know to sell the costs or something 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.909
 to raise funds but that's a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.539
 way to help also on my facebook 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.539
 I share the puppy for what 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.760
 in many cases that we see from 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.450
 animals that throw hot water 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.370
 of the wait without going the potato hachita is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.920
 a bitch of breed that was abandoned by 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.320
 be sick in coming to her in which 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 I found myself because she is the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.310
 appearance of strong in my house I have 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 photos that appear on the fence of my house 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.300
 with a super sad face is that I decided 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
 with jane and take him to the vet and see 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.979
 what he had profession noticed that he did not 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.280
 he could walk he fell he was undernourished 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.100
 sharma had no part his ears were me 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.739
 they forget and we call him the vet 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.260
 they did this analysis until 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.959
 They diagnosed an operation of miracles 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.450
 he could recover with pills he started 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.370
 to feed better with medications and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.520
 began to grow in pela leaves changed the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.820
 hair because a lot of his hair was 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.090
 shaved I had until I put my hair on it the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.090
 had abandoned is 8 years old and is 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.490
 suddenly visit that because of age or 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.460
 because of its poor condition 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.920
 but happily now dating me 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.720
 I have decided to adopt in my house the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.100
 they want quite and apart behaves 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.150
 super good is quiet 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.010
 ink in imola 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.209
 i 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.239
 but why because later help from the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.670
 people girls sometimes we get together with 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.269
 other people who also need 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.150
 help 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.970
 with the puppies he relieves himself they feel 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.950
 Maybe that makes you grow as a person not 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.440
 because you learn to distribute time 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.319
 learn to fight solidarity learn from 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.819
 to be detached you learn to have mercy 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.819
 they are the most intense 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.290
 contact us by facebook always 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.000
 we will sometimes take a 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.070
 bit by how many 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.110
 occupations because we have a couple of 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.540
 days at the most and write or always 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.460
 we answer and there are the photos of the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.620
 students in the option may repeal the 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.390
 can donate pool with the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.130
 food although there are a thousand ways to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.930
 help and near ways also that 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 we help each other but the coast of 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.240
 Working together, working as a team is the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.240
 idea 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.890
 at home
