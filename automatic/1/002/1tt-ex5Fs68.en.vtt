00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.740
 But I lived in that 72 year Italian but 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.429
 That's more than there 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.730
 It is difficult to work 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.750
 There are a lot of points just impressed and among them 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.259
 One was their conversations fulfilled 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.680
 Because it is not superficial either and it is through the argument 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 I have no scratches at the very beginning 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.730
 I do not know each other where Kaga Mariko 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 But before my own solid thoughts are 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.720
 Have exchange of opinions based on having and acceleration 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.050
 Furthermore the original that I also think of the two 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.510
 Take the background behind the base 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.240
 What 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.430
 Broad out the conclusion 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.460
 so 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.320
 Do you say that you have a lot of Dell foot in it? 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.930
 Although the expectation level is rising, it is accompanied by the power to create together 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.650
 I think so 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.060
 That that 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.440
 It is like a regular housewife of a name to let go 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.180
 That man's uncles started to play basketball in the town 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.990
 Do it specially 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850
 Deckard is the party of the completely different people 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.930
 The Japanese also really see the collaboration with the ability to talk 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 You should learn 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.890
 But I think that I was in Japan 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.539
 It seems so right 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.460
 Where they are naturally in their work environment 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.220
 Such a situation was also brought in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300
 That is why Japan's best to argue 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.900
 If I say that I oversee the cycle somehow, I have a nightmare 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.630
 like 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469
 I think that there is a minute there was something such as the department 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.299
 I think it's a post-war Japanese, I think managed 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.590
 I can not 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.420
 In that sense they use that word 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.520
 I will always do it in the workplace that brings out the Sano potential ability of law university 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.439
 Conversely, it is also a material for customers 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.750
 Asked about the brand shop Bek and various things 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.360
 Those people who are going in the line from grandpa's generation 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.229
 To that brand shop 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.919
 It is a song 1. But I am not very good at anything 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:16.660
 Though 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.980
 But something really fixed while respecting Sano kun in the second half 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.739
 There are many places where 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.379
 Nakano Volatility and that polite exhibition tone 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 It seems that they have very much emotion control over that 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:33.999
 Or as a result it is also very successful and again the work environment 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:34.969
 It means 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.010
 The place to learn more than others is the difficult place of work management which he made 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.969
 It was hard 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.559
 That's a shame 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.480
 Royal school 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.629
 It is another general gate but before 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.229
 I was born and raised 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.509
 Wang in the industry of Taiwan 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.229
 How about agility 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.409
 h3 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.229
 Production and sales several years ago 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.979
 is it right 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.959
 Always high 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.659
 Scripture I would like this version 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.209
 Designate a town 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.209
 Cold spread 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.050
 Like going to the public 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.929
 So common benefits 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.599
 Let's find out 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.569
 Do you mean to use it? 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.149
 That way of life 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.779
 There is a reason 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.090
 Canceled 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.209
 In the second half of four strong 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.190
 British 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.260
 If you go into a plane, you'll be called my industrial mansion hall 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.149
 Because it was completely on the moon 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.309
 It's a company too, and I surrounded it with Toyota 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.870
 Aquina 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.999
 I'm sorry but 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.999
 Again a little trial and over the accused 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.299
 The construction period is Koga 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.819
 There is 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.629
 The other one is that brainstorming once 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.829
 I did not put a point 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.779
 If you get everything 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.060
 By accepting everything as much as possible 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.900
 On weekdays there are bigger relationships that I know more deeply 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.359
 Because you can see it 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.049
 Automatic recognition of absolute performance etc. 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.889
 Let's get it done by probability 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.779
 The same dialect by Mao 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.840
 But after all 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.099
 I do not need price competition 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.269
 The use of the side of the side is different from the top 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.690
 The good head of town was really good 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.949
 After all people are ugly 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.069
 Through a big hit and husband's 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.300
 At that time we are not very much 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.319
 It may be a count 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.979
 That makes it 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.699
 Umm 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.939
 Make the sound a public auction 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.840
 Timely 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.389
 I look at the Diet 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.150
 I want to make a final decision on buck-boost 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.569
 It may be related via this thing exactly 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.949
 To make 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.340
 Yubi side is still 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.809
 If not 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:00.110
 Local governments with many creatives 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.639
 The real thing is suddenly the first ball from that 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.379
 I think that you have in the cup or lower 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.389
 After all this is surely human 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.889
 While watching the situation 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.509
 I guess I'm sorry 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.539
 It's like leadership in that area 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.330
 Also 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.909
 Together 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.330
 When it comes to utilizing a creative office 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.650
 It is very important 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.559
 I got lunch 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.769
 Another Japanese, especially that country shop, has been back for two and a half years 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:31.960
 I'm still 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.990
 Until that same 25 years 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.669
 In 1927 I worked alone in France and abroad 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.080
 What became one is that of Japan 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.310
 In the organization of those who are said to be such middle management 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.370
 More than that 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.060
 You've closed the horse, as they said 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 In the organization without any service and in the organization as it is 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.600
 Its communication with others, such as one of the boilers 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.080
 That way of the very 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.740
 Still 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.550
 Villages around the world 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.789
 Someone who is known for position related investigations with people 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.939
 I feel like 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.250
 So there are a lot of Martian land on it 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.200
 After all, if I mentioned such a thing before then 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.370
 I still have a high pixel office view 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.800
 That's where that once for managers 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.360
 List of its lifetime 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.610
 One clearly divided office for the so-called flat employees 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.889
 I was struck but 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.499
 I want to go like this even though the bolt and its circumference 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:33.849
 There was also a place I thought for a while 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.360
 I see 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 Certainly that 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.180
 A long time ago with a manager level 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.339
 Well it was good 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.800
 Have my own judgment 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.440
 There is the thought that was carried out by k-1 rule 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.809
 I want to do something like this 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:54.009
 I do not know the theme I analyzed in Korean times 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.689
 I from 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.009
 If there is aura like middle as this year 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:00.479
 In Tokyo 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.949
 So i want to be an iof town i want to be a 4 day town 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:04.909
 What 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.389
 Such people are always in the organization 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:08.990
 It's eco-friendly 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.869
 Validating marriage registration for departure 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:13.139
 But go 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.220
 Such person became basic 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.979
 Hand we make daily effort to further enhance it 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.119
 I think I've been doing that highlight 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.619
 After all my position 

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:28.919
 Or rather the region that I pulled 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.020
 Really possible 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.919
 I wonder if you have already applied for it?
