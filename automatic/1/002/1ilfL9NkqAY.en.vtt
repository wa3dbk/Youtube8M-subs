00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.830
 with the doctor 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.460
 rocchi responsible for orthopedics 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.460
 of salus hospital 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.830
 prosthetic prosthesis that a theme 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.960
 fundamental in your work 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.790
 this surgical surgery increased the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.279
 its incidence on the own population 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.410
 for the results it achieves and to new ones 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.650
 boundaries linked above all to 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.770
 possibility of implanting prostheses in 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.780
 patients say young and great 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.820
 old or young because now the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.390
 prosthesis white house that knee 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.520
 allows adequate prosthesis duration 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.489
 to the needs the expectations of 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.260
 patient in the big elder because over 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.629
 the prosthetic model suitable for his age 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.430
 there is also the surgical possibility 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.430
 anesthesiology that guarantees a 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.320
 remarkable security of the intervention 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.000
 we also have those materials 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.580
 perhaps they have also made the difference 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 in the duration and effectiveness of the 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.379
 interventions 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.330
 the materials are the real big 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.760
 conquest of the last times even with gods 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.670
 testing problems of 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.340
 adaptation allowed to pass 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.290
 of the durations we say of wear of the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.720
 prosthesis that is the life expectancy of 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.480
 a prosthesis from 10 years that was said 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.090
 years ago there was talk of a prosthesis in the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.370
 eighties now a life of its own 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.250
 about ten years up to data 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.900
 currently almost unbelievable we talk 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.210
 of laboratory data because not 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.310
 we still have the feedback we say 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.050
 on people than what turned out 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.630
 why we implant these prostheses from 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.500
 too little time let's say it's one 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.410
 hip replacement 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.630
 sorry it can even last about 35 years 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.940
 in the lab there is a door for one 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.100
 period similar to 35 years and a prosthesis 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.380
 of knee others 20 then we will see in the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.080
 reality if this is something you do 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.450
 check and talk about collaborations 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 on the subject of orthopedics taking place 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.409
 within the gvm group they are 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.030
 real collaborations allow us to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.450
 exchange data experiences of 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.150
 meet us to have a choice we say 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.590
 very varied of prosthetic implants 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.590
 most of me of the major companies 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.740
 worldwide because of this number 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.200
 of orthopedic environment in which they come 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.450
 applied and allow us even further 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.160
 that we exchange information to stay 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.990
 updated to attend stuff by 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.090
 organize conferences 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.650
 the gvm group regarding 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.630
 the entire group of inter and specialties 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.850
 but in orthopedics organizes 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.150
 periodic updates in the various locations 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.260
 just us in December first precision 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.890
 December we will organize a conference 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.140
 right on the dedicated prosthetic both 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.270
 to orthopedists especially to the real 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.060
 users say indirect prosthetic 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.040
 who are the general practitioners e 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.040
 physiotherapists and physiatrists
