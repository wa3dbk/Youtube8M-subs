you a look at the size dimension

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.580 
you a look at the size dimension

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
difference so you'll see just a little

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
difference so you'll see just a little
bit<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> difference<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> height<00:01:38.520> here

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
bit of a difference in height here

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.180

it's<00:01:40.860> quite<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.340> better

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.450 

Wolverine

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.140 

so<00:01:54.940> that's<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.180> brief<00:01:55.299> hands-on<00:01:55.770> iphone<00:01:56.770> 5

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
so that's a brief hands-on iphone 5

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.049 
so that's a brief hands-on iphone 5
hopefully<00:01:58.150> beginning<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.510> spend<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.810> bit<00:01:59.020> more
