00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.970
 Of course, he does not fly like space 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.330
 tourist when this plan old 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.920
 back here our task will be announced 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.289
 implement a number 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.350
 space experiments are three main 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.920
 directions this physico-technical 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.060
 research a series of experiments 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.000
 space monitoring will be unique 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.199
 observe the state of ecology in 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.030
 particular state 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.230
 Sharp or behind the movement of dust storms 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.589
 heavenly 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.989
 let's build the Caspian Sea know the problem 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.909
 not in those pollution is also before 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.519
 our scientists to work out various 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.829
 techniques and process and no one like 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.139
 Once there will be communication from aboard the international 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.239
 space station this study 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:55.329
 influence of conditions 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.850
 space flight to astronaut by 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.059
 research cosmonaut himself this 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.089
 effect on the main body you 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.850
 gamma radiation performance this 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.820
 blood test 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.170
 cosmonaut manufacturing Cossack 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.300
 products of Kazan products consisting 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.850
 about 8 items 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.640
 ring set meat in Kazakh and so on 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.000
 which will be planned by ours 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780
 cosmo to our cosmonauts turkey 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 astronauts who is on 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.369
 howards end for approbation as she 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.070
 affect the body raises it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.710
 health condition 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.100
 The arrangement was such that Kazakhstan 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 pays this amount for take all costs 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.729
 Russian side ensuring this 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.340
 space flight of our cosmonaut 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.460
 amount that the country requested 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.549
 is 1 billion 100 million 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.259
 Russian rubles is about 20 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.330
 million us dollars competition 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.979
 today take into account that funds for 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.730
 flight they were not provided 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.410
 initially you know the budget is formed 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.660
 in advance for the year in three years 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 forward 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.450
 these funds are not embedded in 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.580
 republican budget for this year 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.040
 agreement is made that money 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.769
 for the camp take next year in 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.870
 sixteenth year are considered different 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.730
 reimbursement options except there it is for 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.580
 rent account at the expense of others 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.530
 of sources 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.819
 the question is now being worked out and by 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.739
 instructions of the government of the republic 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.070
 just if you do everything 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:46.030
 plans will take place landing is expected on the 12th 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.560
 September is about time a morning guide 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.560
 about 7 am
