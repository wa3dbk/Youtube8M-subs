00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.830
 [Music] 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.779
 hello I'm kidding is here to talk 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.849
 of them specific leather for motorcycles 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.210
 the brand dainese along the model 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.300
 it's the giant racing baby so the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.630
 peeled racing is leather cattle is 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.050
 also to escape you made up of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.050
 drive to elastic on the sides for 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.450
 facilitate the position as much for 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.780
 facilitate this visit this position if 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.699
 we put here an elastic fabric is 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.219
 as resistant as leather to abrasion 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.300
 which is also found on the shoulder blades 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:53.120
 and on the spot we see the protections 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.309
 a composite that are well lasting the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.350
 protects well under the colors on the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.690
 shoulders are shoulders you see the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.179
 techno protection train those of the leathers 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.909
 which is welded above the protection 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.440
 and afterwards you still do not see it 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.500
 what we normally see in 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.870
 motogp and that's enough production 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.790
 galley aluminum aluminum 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.080
 normally it serves to slip if we 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.090
 falls to with the shoulders 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.320
 so this production will make us 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.340
 slide under the buttons 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.939
 so we will not break the clavicle on 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.520
 so jackets with two pockets forward on 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.000
 each side of ventilation on each 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 side as well at the chest level and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.930
 also at the level of friends so super 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.030
 important after that so we have a cost 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.460
 adjustable to the adjustable stroke is composed 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.869
 of two clips so for the hawks coup 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.450
 if we open the zipper 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.789
 we can also find a pocket 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.789
 inside it looks like it's a us 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.460
 have been rather but we can use it 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.149
 also in winter if we manage to put it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.969
 below 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.289
 it's among operas or something 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.090
 a little bit later mik 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.100
 because it's true that this jacket there 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.280
 there is not a removable liner and is 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.280
 leader 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.390
 we can hang him pants from 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.550
 houses while they are leather or 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.400
 still will do on the behind we can 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.040
 find inside the jacket the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.379
 pocket to put a back protector 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.000
 of type g1 or g2 here we find the re 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.750
 reflective strips 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.459
 here too for better security 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.090
 would also say that one can well to that 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.410
 created in the summer 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.910
 so if we beat the Eid and the state the winter 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.650
 we do not have a sweater so we have your place 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.959
 a lot of room inside the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.910
 jacket always centered and there 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.480
 avoid like that leers before them and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.560
 that it's swollen it looks like it's a 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.090
 jacket with a very reasonable price 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.599
 because it's not a very high price 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.459
 high but we have the qualities of a jacket 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.739
 racing with a lot of protection with 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.629
 a leather that is extremely comfortable 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.700
 and you will see that it is a good choice 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.700
 to have an increased need 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.520
