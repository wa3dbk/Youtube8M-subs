highlight is harvest and we're now
bringing<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.580> popcorn<00:00:17.119> in<00:00:17.330> from<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:17.960> farm<00:00:18.230> to

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
bringing the popcorn in from the farm to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.420 
bringing the popcorn in from the farm to
the<00:00:18.949> plant<00:00:19.340> where<00:00:19.730> we<00:00:20.150> need<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:20.630> do<00:00:20.869> our<00:00:20.900> job<00:00:21.380> to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
the plant where we need to do our job to

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.170 
the plant where we need to do our job to
correctly<00:00:22.570> condition<00:00:23.570> that<00:00:23.750> green<00:00:25.090> so<00:00:26.090> the

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
correctly condition that green so the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.330 
correctly condition that green so the
quality<00:00:26.420> begins<00:00:27.020> from<00:00:27.620> the<00:00:27.770> time<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.160> select

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
quality begins from the time you select

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.360 
quality begins from the time you select
the<00:00:28.640> seed<00:00:28.940> and<00:00:29.780> the<00:00:29.960> hybrid<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.860> genetics

behind it and of course how it's handled
we<00:00:33.950> really<00:00:34.160> want<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:34.340> do<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.489> lot<00:00:34.670> of

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
we really want to do a lot of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.229 
we really want to do a lot of
preparation<00:00:35.030> before<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.780> gets<00:00:35.960> here

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
preparation before it gets here

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.330 
preparation before it gets here
once<00:00:38.239> it's<00:00:38.480> here<00:00:38.809> we<00:00:39.079> can<00:00:39.379> clean<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.100> and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
once it's here we can clean it and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.140 
once it's here we can clean it and
process<00:00:40.880> it<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.450> condition<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:43.150> you've

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
process it and condition it you've

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.210 
process it and condition it you've
noticed<00:00:44.540> from<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.780> time<00:00:44.989> it's<00:00:45.170> received<00:00:45.649> no

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
one touches that popcorn food this is

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.920 
one touches that popcorn food this is
actually<00:00:49.280> pretty<00:00:49.550> refined<00:00:50.300> anything<00:00:50.780> you

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
actually pretty refined anything you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.600 
actually pretty refined anything you
know<00:00:50.989> this<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.739> iodine<00:00:52.070> test<00:00:52.309> which

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
know this is the iodine test which

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.850 
know this is the iodine test which
stains<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.270> broken<00:00:54.079> kernels<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.620> crack

stains the broken kernels in the crack

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.330 
stains the broken kernels in the crack
and<00:00:55.160> also<00:00:55.399> makes<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.730> easier<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.120> see<00:01:00.340> they're

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
and also makes it easier to see they're

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.179 
and also makes it easier to see they're
cracked<00:01:01.610> or<00:01:01.760> broken<00:01:01.820> they<00:01:02.450> won't<00:01:02.660> pop<00:01:03.189> they

farmers an alternative that helps spread

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.069 
farmers an alternative that helps spread
out<00:01:57.979> their<00:01:58.189> workload<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.090> planting<00:01:59.600> time<00:01:59.840> is

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
out their workload the planting time is

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.350 
out their workload the planting time is
a<00:02:00.110> little<00:02:00.380> bit<00:02:00.530> different<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.729> harvest<00:02:02.149> time

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
a little bit different the harvest time

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.600 
a little bit different the harvest time
is<00:02:02.420> different<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.740> just<00:02:04.009> help<00:02:04.189> spread<00:02:04.490> out

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
is different and so just help spread out

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.330 
is different and so just help spread out
the<00:02:04.759> workload<00:02:05.469> then<00:02:06.469> provides<00:02:06.860> one<00:02:07.100> more

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
the workload then provides one more

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.219 
the workload then provides one more
alternative<00:02:08.000> crop<00:02:08.239> for<00:02:08.569> local<00:02:09.019> farmers
