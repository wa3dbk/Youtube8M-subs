00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello to you habib wildan 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 and today I would like to show you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 quick retouching method and so let's 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.109
 immediately start creating a copy 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:19.460
 of our layer and set it to mode 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.460
 liner light overlay 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.750
 now let's call the adjustment layer 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 invert and attach it to 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.800
 copied condition now let's 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 reduce the opacity of the copied 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 layer up to 50 percent and now we have 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.699
 almost everything is ready only 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 translate layer into smart object and all 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:04.739
 billet ready now we go filter 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 high pass color contrast as a layer 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 we inverted then everything works 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.220
 on the contrary high pass acts as 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.560
 gaussian blur here we can remove 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.509
 unnecessary volumes that is get rid of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.009
 all pimples and all sorts of unnecessary 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.729
 skin fluctuations go in increments 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:31.110
 increase but so that contrasting 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.479
 boundaries remained read and well 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.479
 this value will suit me, I press ok 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.049
 Well, everything is ready 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.689
 it seems to work out now let's 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.549
 set fine detail image 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:53.670
 To do this, go to the blur filter voice 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.079
 blur set the same value 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 what was hype xing and moving side 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200
 decrease 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 until the skin is until the skin is not 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.590
 soften click ok 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.170
 it turns out we blurred the picture on 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.590
 twenty six pixels and restored 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.480
 details from 0 to 12 pixels to us 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.660
 This effect must be preserved. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.230
 only on the skin for this we create a white 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.660
 mask 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.820
 invert and and pressing the key combination 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.690
 kontrol and take a brush and white pass 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.690
 all her skin 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.620
 need to act carefully not 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.569
 coming on the contrast border 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:03:02.810
 otherwise there will be porridge porridge in the form 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:09.439
 color mixing was became leather became 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.849
 much better nicer what else high pass 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.840
 and gaussian blur 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.079
 should not differ more than 3 times 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.010
 otherwise the skin will become too chilly soapy. 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.780
 I recommend to comply 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.079
 this rule also you can always 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:32.980
 change the necessary values ​​of the radii then 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.980
 there is more blur image 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:43.129
 well and not forgetting the rule 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:45.189
 not more than 3 times tighten Gaussian 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.189
 blur 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.600
 rejoice in the result before after this 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.069
 Thanks for attention
