okay so I'm just gonna start up and show

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:18.929 
okay so I'm just gonna start up and show
you<00:01:07.630> how<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.900> looks<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.320> how<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.560> performs

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.599 

don't<00:01:19.929> forget<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.380> little<00:01:20.799> phone<00:01:21.249> here<00:01:21.490> it

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
don't forget this little phone here it

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.050 
don't forget this little phone here it
doesn't<00:01:21.759> really<00:01:21.909> have<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.179> bestest<00:01:22.659> specs<00:01:22.990> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
doesn't really have the bestest specs so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.340 
doesn't really have the bestest specs so
don't<00:01:25.060> be<00:01:25.149> surprised<00:01:25.509> if<00:01:25.719> we<00:01:25.869> face<00:01:26.049> a<00:01:26.079> little

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
don't be surprised if we face a little

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.880 
don't be surprised if we face a little
bit<00:01:26.469> of<00:01:26.649> lag<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.060> ain't<00:01:28.179> got<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.509> best

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
bit of lag because it ain't got the best

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.630 
bit of lag because it ain't got the best
processor<00:01:34.709> and<00:01:35.709> it<00:01:35.799> don't<00:01:36.069> really<00:01:36.219> have<00:01:36.429> too

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
processor and it don't really have too

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.249 
processor and it don't really have too
much<00:01:36.850> rum<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> let's<00:01:40.329> just<00:01:40.599> see<00:01:40.780> how<00:01:40.959> well<00:01:41.140> it

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
much rum so let's just see how well it

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:58.179 
much rum so let's just see how well it
performs

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:06.020 

okay<00:01:59.189> so<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:04.590> using<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.430> screen<00:02:05.640> touch

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
okay so I'm using the on screen touch

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.080 
okay so I'm using the on screen touch
buttons<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.509> find<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.990> easier<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.850> control<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
buttons I find it easier to control the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:18.520 
buttons I find it easier to control the
car<00:02:09.330> with

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.170
