00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:01.410> lately<00:00:01.770> I've<00:00:02.010> been<00:00:02.100> charging<00:00:02.580> the

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so lately I've been charging the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.700 
so lately I've been charging the
batteries<00:00:03.120> out<00:00:03.750> here<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.290> doghouse<00:00:06.710> when

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
batteries out here on the doghouse when

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
batteries out here on the doghouse when
it's<00:00:07.859> not<00:00:08.040> raining<00:00:08.280> anyways<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.269> these<00:00:09.450> are

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
it's not raining anyways so these are

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.049 
it's not raining anyways so these are
done<00:00:10.099> so<00:00:11.099> today<00:00:11.400> we're<00:00:11.519> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> look<00:00:11.880> at

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
done so today we're going to look at

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.849 
done so today we're going to look at
bump<00:00:12.420> steer<00:00:12.920> what<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:14.730> causes<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
bump steer what is it what causes it and

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.189 
bump steer what is it what causes it and
does<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.010> machine<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.609> any<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.600> let's<00:00:18.630> dig

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
does this machine have any so let's dig

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.380 
does this machine have any so let's dig
around<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.710> bit<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.180> come

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
around a little bit and see what we come

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.349 
around a little bit and see what we come
up<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:22.160> hey<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> picked<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.820> these<00:00:24.000> tires

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
up with hey so I picked up these tires

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
up with hey so I picked up these tires
here<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> ear<00:00:25.410> evil

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
here for the ear evil

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.089 
here for the ear evil
these<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.789> proline<00:00:27.599> trenchers<00:00:28.170> pretty<00:00:28.890> deep

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
these are proline trenchers pretty deep

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.800 
these are proline trenchers pretty deep
tread<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
tread and I think it's going to be a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.049 
tread and I think it's going to be a
pretty<00:00:31.050> good<00:00:31.170> tire<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.769> winter<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.610> stuff<00:00:32.850> in

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
pretty good tire for winter and stuff in

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:33.680 
pretty good tire for winter and stuff in
snow

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
snow

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.250 
snow
so<00:00:34.559> bump<00:00:35.460> steer<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.989> term<00:00:37.230> that's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so bump steer it's a term that's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.280 
so bump steer it's a term that's
generally<00:00:38.250> used<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> describe<00:00:38.899> what<00:00:39.899> happens

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
generally used to describe what happens

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880 
generally used to describe what happens
to<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> wheels<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.660> vehicle<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.780> has<00:00:43.020> some

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
to the wheels on a vehicle that has some

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
to the wheels on a vehicle that has some
messed-up<00:00:44.129> geometry<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.289> what<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> mean<00:00:46.500> by

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
messed-up geometry and what I mean by

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
messed-up geometry and what I mean by
that<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.070> let's<00:00:47.579> say<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> suspension<00:00:48.420> was

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that is let's say the suspension was

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.959 
that is let's say the suspension was
going<00:00:48.870> through<00:00:49.020> its<00:00:49.170> cycle<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.800> I've<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
going through its cycle and I've got the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
going through its cycle and I've got the
front<00:00:51.180> tires<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.690> hand<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
front tires in my hand here the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920 
front tires in my hand here the
suspension<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
suspension is going down and then it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.619 
suspension is going down and then it
toes<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> suspension<00:00:57.449> goes

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
toes out and then the suspension goes

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.020 
toes out and then the suspension goes
the<00:00:57.780> other<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> toes<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:59.070> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the other way and then it toes in so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
the other way and then it toes in so
that's<00:01:00.270> bump<00:01:00.629> steer<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.410> suspension<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that's bump steer the suspension is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.939 
that's bump steer the suspension is
causing<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> steer<00:01:03.619> when<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.769> not

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
causing it to steer when it's not

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.450 
causing it to steer when it's not
supposed<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> ear<00:01:07.350> Evo<00:01:07.770> seems<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> be

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
supposed to so the ear Evo seems to be

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.030 
supposed to so the ear Evo seems to be
set<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.970> fairly<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.049> doesn't<00:01:10.830> really

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
set up fairly well it doesn't really

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
set up fairly well it doesn't really
have<00:01:11.250> much<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.729> bump<00:01:11.970> steer<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.330> least<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
have much for bump steer at least you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.320 
have much for bump steer at least you
can't<00:01:12.920> see<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.130> offhand<00:01:14.490> maybe<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
can't see it right offhand maybe if a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.410 
can't see it right offhand maybe if a
guy<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.630> carefully<00:01:15.930> measure<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
guy would carefully measure you know but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
guy would carefully measure you know but
it<00:01:19.020> seems<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> pretty<00:01:19.710> good

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it seems to be pretty good

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.760 
it seems to be pretty good
it<00:01:20.549> does<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.000> scrub<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> when

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it does have some scrub and that is when

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.399 
it does have some scrub and that is when
the<00:01:22.979> wheels<00:01:23.720> physically<00:01:24.720> move<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.320> out

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the wheels physically move in and out

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.210 
the wheels physically move in and out
because<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.880> angle<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> arms

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
because of the the angle of the a arms

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
because of the the angle of the a arms
so<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.350> but<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.530> far

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so you can see some of that but as far

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920 
so you can see some of that but as far
as<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.159> bump<00:01:32.430> steer<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:33.390> doesn't<00:01:33.689> seem<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
as the bump steer really doesn't seem to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.620 
as the bump steer really doesn't seem to
be<00:01:34.020> much<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:35.150> just<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> part

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
be much going on there just to the part

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:56.350 
be much going on there just to the part
of<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> video<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.380> don't<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.680> any<00:01:37.829> talking

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.789 

so<00:01:57.360> let's<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:57.750> piece<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.229> paper<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.680> an

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
so let's say that piece of paper is an

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.060 
so let's say that piece of paper is an
AR<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.400> where<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.510> bending<00:02:01.070> represents

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
AR and where it's bending represents

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.880 
AR and where it's bending represents
ball<00:02:02.310> joints<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.360> rod<00:02:03.810> end<00:02:04.080> someplace<00:02:04.710> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
ball joints or a rod end someplace in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.640 
ball joints or a rod end someplace in
the<00:02:04.979> suspension<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.909> pivot<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> now

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
the suspension where it can pivot so now

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.330 
the suspension where it can pivot so now
I'm<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.130> add<00:02:08.310> another<00:02:08.670> AR<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
I'm going to add another AR and you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.630 
I'm going to add another AR and you
notice<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.819> bending<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.420> same<00:02:12.690> location

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
notice it's bending in the same location

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.640 
notice it's bending in the same location
so<00:02:14.640> these<00:02:15.300> two<00:02:15.540> pieces<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> paper<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.470> doesn't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
so these two pieces of paper it doesn't

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.330 
so these two pieces of paper it doesn't
matter<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.280> they're<00:02:18.060> bent<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.020> or<00:02:19.890> if<00:02:20.220> I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
matter if they're bent like this or if I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.650 
matter if they're bent like this or if I
completely<00:02:20.760> stretch<00:02:21.090> them<00:02:21.300> out<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.510> make

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
completely stretch them out and make

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.199 
completely stretch them out and make
them<00:02:21.810> straight<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.520> either<00:02:23.520> case<00:02:23.910> they're

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
them straight in either case they're

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.720 
them straight in either case they're
completely<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> same<00:02:24.959> length<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:26.489> now<00:02:26.640> I'm

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
completely the same length so now I'm

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.759 
completely the same length so now I'm
going<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.970> add<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> tie<00:02:27.450> rod<00:02:27.660> normally<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> tie

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
going to add a tie rod normally the tie

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.100 
going to add a tie rod normally the tie
rod<00:02:29.010> would<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.340> sandwiched<00:02:30.300> between<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
rod would be sandwiched between the a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.600 
rod would be sandwiched between the a
arms<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.030> illustrate<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:35.100> at<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
arms but just to illustrate so at this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.470 
arms but just to illustrate so at this
end<00:02:36.050> they're<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.380> same<00:02:38.209> they're<00:02:39.209> bending

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
end they're all the same they're bending

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.990 
end they're all the same they're bending
in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.720> same<00:02:39.989> location<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.489> over<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:42.860> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
in the same location but over here the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.860 
in the same location but over here the
tie<00:02:45.000> rod<00:02:45.269> has<00:02:45.989> its<00:02:46.260> own<00:02:46.440> spot<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.980> flex<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.660> what

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
tie rod has its own spot to flex so what

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.960 
tie rod has its own spot to flex so what
would<00:02:48.959> happen<00:02:49.380> when<00:02:50.250> everything<00:02:50.850> is

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
would happen when everything is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.270 
would happen when everything is
stretched<00:02:51.269> out<00:02:51.860> everything<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> same

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
stretched out everything is the same

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.740 
stretched out everything is the same
length

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
length

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.600 
length
however<00:02:54.750> when<00:02:55.350> everything<00:02:55.800> starts<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.280> flex

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
however when everything starts to flex

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.630 
however when everything starts to flex
then<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.540> tie<00:02:57.750> rod<00:02:57.989> becomes<00:02:58.350> shorter<00:02:58.920> than

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
then the tie rod becomes shorter than

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.210 
then the tie rod becomes shorter than
the<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> arms<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.200> causes<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.799> wheel<00:03:01.950> to

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the a arms and it causes the wheel to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.330 
the a arms and it causes the wheel to
get<00:03:02.340> pulled<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:03.650> okay<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.709> back<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
get pulled in okay so back to the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.550 
get pulled in okay so back to the
drawing<00:03:05.370> board<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.750> revised<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.350> tie

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
drawing board it just revised the tie

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.520 
drawing board it just revised the tie
rod<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.329> can<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.660> used<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.959> flex<00:03:10.200> here

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
rod so you can see it used to flex here

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
rod so you can see it used to flex here
well<00:03:11.010> now<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> made<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.910> flexes

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
well now I made it so that it flexes

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.600 
well now I made it so that it flexes
here<00:03:12.600> together<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> arms<00:03:13.829> so<00:03:14.430> now

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
here together with the a arms so now

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.430 
here together with the a arms so now
they're<00:03:15.120> all<00:03:15.150> speaking<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> same<00:03:16.260> language

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
they're all speaking the same language

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.759 
they're all speaking the same language
they<00:03:17.010> all<00:03:17.160> do<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.610> same<00:03:17.640> thing<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.329> then<00:03:19.079> bump

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
they all do the same thing and then bump

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.060 
they all do the same thing and then bump
steer<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.510> another<00:03:21.510> problem<00:03:21.780> anymore<00:03:22.290> but

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
steer is another problem anymore but

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.030 
steer is another problem anymore but
typically<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:24.079> vehicles<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.170> are<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
typically for vehicles that are on the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
typically for vehicles that are on the
street<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.519> lot<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.150> production<00:03:27.600> vehicles

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
street a lot of production vehicles

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.080 
street a lot of production vehicles
they've<00:03:28.530> got<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.799> shorter<00:03:29.310> top<00:03:29.640> AR<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:32.090> then

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
they've got a shorter top AR and so then

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.660 
they've got a shorter top AR and so then
the<00:03:33.450> tie<00:03:33.989> rod<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> stick<00:03:34.560> has<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.100> be<00:03:35.190> completely

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
the tie rod a stick has to be completely

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.430 
the tie rod a stick has to be completely
revised<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.540> know<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.750> can't<00:03:36.989> use<00:03:37.140> this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
revised you know you can't use this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.630 
revised you know you can't use this
setup<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:39.209> short<00:03:40.200> top<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.859> longer<00:03:41.160> bottom

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
setup on a short top and a longer bottom

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.080 
setup on a short top and a longer bottom
so<00:03:42.060> then<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.859> tie<00:03:44.100> rod<00:03:44.340> length<00:03:44.609> has<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:44.940> be

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
so then the the tie rod length has to be

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.069 
so then the the tie rod length has to be
revised<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.739> pivot<00:03:46.920> points<00:03:47.430> are<00:03:47.609> are

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
revised so that the pivot points are are

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.380 
revised so that the pivot points are are
coinciding<00:03:49.079> with<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.940> different<00:03:50.940> angles

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
coinciding with the different angles

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.050 
coinciding with the different angles
here<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.230> arms<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.340> works<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.820> can

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
here of the a arms but it works it can

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.180 
here of the a arms but it works it can
be<00:03:54.209> made<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.420> work<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.709> how<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.890> tie

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
be made to work so you see how the tie

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.030 
be made to work so you see how the tie
rod<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.609> parallel<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.480> arms<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:59.010> a

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
rod is parallel to the a arms and the a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460 
rod is parallel to the a arms and the a
arms<00:03:59.489> are<00:03:59.640> parallel<00:03:59.820> to<00:04:00.090> each<00:04:00.239> other<00:04:00.570> well

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
arms are parallel to each other well

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.199 
arms are parallel to each other well
that's<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.769> big<00:04:01.980> factor<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.489> getting<00:04:03.030> rid<00:04:03.180> of

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
that's a big factor in getting rid of

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.620 
that's a big factor in getting rid of
bump<00:04:03.600> steer<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
bump steer and

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.300 
bump steer and
from<00:04:04.750> there<00:04:04.960> it's<00:04:05.260> all<00:04:05.560> about<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.950> pivot

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
from there it's all about the pivot

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.490 
from there it's all about the pivot
points<00:04:06.700> exactly<00:04:07.330> where<00:04:07.780> does<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.020> all<00:04:08.140> flex

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
points exactly where does it all flex

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.770 
points exactly where does it all flex
and<00:04:08.860> also<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.820> length<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.360> tie<00:04:10.540> rod

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and also the length of the tie rod

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.570 
and also the length of the tie rod
itself<00:04:11.200> in<00:04:12.060> relation<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.480> DA<00:04:14.230> arms<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.340> now

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
itself in relation to the DA arms so now

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.760 
itself in relation to the DA arms so now
in<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:15.880> paper<00:04:16.150> illustration<00:04:16.870> when<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.410> say

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
in that paper illustration when I say

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.340 
in that paper illustration when I say
that<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.700> tie<00:04:18.910> rod<00:04:19.150> gets<00:04:19.480> shorter<00:04:19.959> it's<00:04:20.170> not

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
that the tie rod gets shorter it's not

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.440 
that the tie rod gets shorter it's not
that<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.370> like<00:04:21.550> if<00:04:21.670> you<00:04:21.790> measure<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
that you know like if you measure it

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.970 
that you know like if you measure it
with<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.570> tape<00:04:22.840> measure<00:04:22.870> it's<00:04:23.350> physically

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
with a tape measure it's physically

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.430 
with a tape measure it's physically
getting<00:04:24.160> shorter<00:04:24.700> not<00:04:25.420> like<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.750> metal<00:04:26.320> is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
getting shorter not like the metal is

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.140 
getting shorter not like the metal is
compressing<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.160> stretching<00:04:27.190> but<00:04:27.760> it's<00:04:27.910> from

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
compressing and stretching but it's from

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.660 
compressing and stretching but it's from
a<00:04:28.180> geometries<00:04:28.960> perspective<00:04:29.710> what<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.460> wheel

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
a geometries perspective what the wheel

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.970 
a geometries perspective what the wheel
can<00:04:30.910> feel<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:33.220> gets<00:04:33.490> shorter<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:33.940> longer

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
can feel is it gets shorter and longer

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.830 
can feel is it gets shorter and longer
all<00:04:35.980> right<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.490> there's<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.940> tie<00:04:37.300> rod<00:04:37.570> hooked

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
all right so there's the tie rod hooked

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.500 
all right so there's the tie rod hooked
onto<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.320> rack<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.980> it's<00:04:39.820> also<00:04:40.000> hooked<00:04:40.300> onto

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
onto the rack and it's also hooked onto

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.380 
onto the rack and it's also hooked onto
this<00:04:40.780> end<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.310> arms<00:04:42.310> are<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.550> place<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.120> is<00:04:43.270> the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
this end a arms are in place so is the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.510 
this end a arms are in place so is the
spindle<00:04:43.720> so<00:04:44.500> I'm<00:04:44.860> going<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.070> show<00:04:45.220> you<00:04:45.280> what

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
spindle so I'm going to show you what

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.950 
spindle so I'm going to show you what
the<00:04:45.640> bump<00:04:45.850> steer<00:04:46.060> looks<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.480> on<00:04:46.630> this<00:04:46.750> thing

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the bump steer looks like on this thing

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.540 
the bump steer looks like on this thing
now<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.350> I'm<00:04:47.830> going<00:04:47.920> to<00:04:48.010> lift<00:04:48.100> this<00:04:48.190> all<00:04:48.400> up

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
now so I'm going to lift this all up

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.670 
now so I'm going to lift this all up
with<00:04:48.700> my<00:04:48.730> right<00:04:49.060> arm<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.510> try<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:50.380> record

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
with my right arm and try and record

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.710 
with my right arm and try and record
with<00:04:50.890> my<00:04:51.070> left<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.550> what<00:04:52.000> I'm<00:04:52.120> watching<00:04:52.510> for

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
with my left and what I'm watching for

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.020 
with my left and what I'm watching for
is<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.230> spindle<00:04:53.560> isn't<00:04:54.550> going<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.790> point

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
is that the spindle isn't going to point

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.020 
is that the spindle isn't going to point
forward<00:04:55.360> or<00:04:55.900> point<00:04:56.230> backwards<00:04:56.740> as<00:04:57.030> goes

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
forward or point backwards as goes

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.050 
forward or point backwards as goes
through<00:04:58.270> its<00:04:58.390> motion<00:04:58.780> here<00:04:59.160> so<00:05:00.160> let's<00:05:00.790> see<00:05:00.940> if

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
through its motion here so let's see if

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:17.890 
through its motion here so let's see if
I<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.390> pull<00:05:01.630> this<00:05:01.780> off<00:05:01.960> here<00:05:04.170> all<00:05:05.170> right

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900 

so<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.110> was<00:05:19.229> about<00:05:19.440> 33<00:05:20.009> inches<00:05:20.099> of<00:05:20.490> travel

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
so that was about 33 inches of travel

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.089 
so that was about 33 inches of travel
there<00:05:21.060> that<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.300> just<00:05:21.539> simulated<00:05:22.110> looking<00:05:22.860> for

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
there that I just simulated looking for

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.770 
there that I just simulated looking for
a<00:05:23.129> bump<00:05:23.460> steer<00:05:23.669> but<00:05:23.819> in<00:05:23.970> actual<00:05:24.419> use<00:05:24.569> that

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
a bump steer but in actual use that

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.050 
a bump steer but in actual use that
would<00:05:24.870> be<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:24.990> little<00:05:25.229> less<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.490> haven't<00:05:27.000> done

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
would be a little less so I haven't done

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.640 
would be a little less so I haven't done
anything<00:05:27.330> with<00:05:27.599> this<00:05:27.720> machine<00:05:27.990> at<00:05:28.169> all<00:05:28.289> since

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
anything with this machine at all since

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.339 
anything with this machine at all since
the<00:05:28.800> last<00:05:28.949> video<00:05:29.400> but<00:05:29.930> it's<00:05:30.930> still<00:05:31.110> in<00:05:31.259> the

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
the last video but it's still in the

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.710 
the last video but it's still in the
bucket<00:05:31.650> list<00:05:31.830> it's<00:05:32.129> a<00:05:32.430> kind<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.330> really<00:05:33.569> nice

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
bucket list it's a kind of a really nice

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.510 
bucket list it's a kind of a really nice
project<00:05:34.259> when<00:05:34.409> the<00:05:34.530> weather<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:34.919> bad<00:05:35.129> side

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
project when the weather is bad side

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.610 
project when the weather is bad side
winter<00:05:36.360> time<00:05:36.539> is<00:05:36.720> awesome<00:05:36.900> for<00:05:37.259> this<00:05:37.379> kind<00:05:37.560> of

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
winter time is awesome for this kind of

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.610 
winter time is awesome for this kind of
stuff<00:05:37.830> but<00:05:38.669> it's<00:05:39.629> in<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.810> bucket<00:05:39.960> list<00:05:40.229> we'll

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
stuff but it's in the bucket list we'll

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.979 
stuff but it's in the bucket list we'll
get<00:05:40.770> her<00:05:40.830> done
