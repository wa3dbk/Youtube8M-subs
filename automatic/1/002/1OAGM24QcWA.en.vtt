00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
I felt you and McGregor was at the top

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.060 
I felt you and McGregor was at the top
of<00:05:08.300> his<00:05:08.390> game<00:05:08.570> in<00:05:09.140> fact<00:05:09.440> this<00:05:09.620> is<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.860> best

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
of his game in fact this is the best

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.070 
of his game in fact this is the best
work<00:05:10.250> I've<00:05:10.490> ever<00:05:10.520> seen<00:05:11.060> from<00:05:11.270> McGregor<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.960> he

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
work I've ever seen from McGregor and he

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.390 
work I've ever seen from McGregor and he
should<00:05:12.230> consider<00:05:12.380> playing<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.950> regular<00:05:13.250> guy

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
should consider playing a regular guy

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.550 
should consider playing a regular guy
more<00:05:13.700> often<00:05:14.060> but<00:05:14.630> then<00:05:14.810> just<00:05:15.110> like<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.350> bad

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560

started to unravel about halfway through

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.850 
started to unravel about halfway through
it<00:05:20.330> was<00:05:20.570> as<00:05:20.780> if<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.110> filmmakers<00:05:21.590> had<00:05:21.740> this

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
it was as if the filmmakers had this

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.159 
it was as if the filmmakers had this
great<00:05:22.130> setup<00:05:22.610> but<00:05:22.820> no<00:05:23.000> idea<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.419> execute<00:05:24.080> it

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
great setup but no idea to execute it

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.900 
great setup but no idea to execute it
and<00:05:24.380> at<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.800> very<00:05:25.040> end<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.490> film<00:05:25.700> the

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
and at the very end of the film the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.940 
and at the very end of the film the
soldiers<00:05:26.300> are<00:05:26.450> so<00:05:26.630> irresponsible<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.650> it

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
soldiers are so irresponsible that it

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.710 
soldiers are so irresponsible that it
made<00:05:28.100> me<00:05:28.280> very<00:05:28.310> concerned<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.120> any<00:05:29.419> of<00:05:29.600> this

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
made me very concerned that any of this

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.140 
made me very concerned that any of this
movie<00:05:29.990> was<00:05:30.110> based<00:05:30.350> on<00:05:30.500> real<00:05:30.680> events<00:05:30.940> so<00:05:31.940> the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
movie was based on real events so the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.760 
movie was based on real events so the
Army<00:05:32.419> has<00:05:32.540> way<00:05:32.750> too<00:05:32.810> much<00:05:33.080> money<00:05:33.320> and<00:05:33.470> free
