00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Tell us the college guys from Brazil that 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.549
 It's Sergio and today's video is a bit 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.560
 different but very cool 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.630
 Come with me, you're good to me. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 long since living out there and 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.049
 I started the videos the channel was growing 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 and speaking of much that happens 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.490
 in the life of college students and indeed 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.020
 This channel changed my life and it's very 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.279
 cool to know that the university capenga 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.500
 makes a difference in the lives of many 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.939
 people also with the videos with the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.680
 blog or facebook 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.180
 thousands of people are connected and we 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.340
 We know that the lives of students are there. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 your problems, but we can find 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 In this, it is possible to see the study of a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.190
 way well but with good accompanying me 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.390
 more closely you know that on facebook and the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.309
 twitter lately I stayed 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 Saying that you want some news out there 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.149
 It's good the first one is that the blog is 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.710
 almost ready to return with the club and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.510
 soon we will have new 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.950
 Kinds of cool videos here on the channel 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 Another thing that I enjoyed very much was 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 participate in the creation of the portal c 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 along with my friend mary esse 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.289
 project has been helping a lot of people 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.120
 Now I want to help a lot more. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.710
 I really love working with 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 university public and it's legal to do 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 Grace, some problems we have right? 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 I think so I thought and if besides doing 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.320
 Thank you, we could also find 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 together the solution of most of these 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.630
 problems 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 well I'll talk what I think about 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.960
 all those years working with the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.490
 university students I could see that yes we 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.650
 We have a lot of problems that disturb 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.509
 our life and end up making it difficult for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.369
 we can be the student who 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.810
 I wanted to be and I see that a lot 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.090
 People end up blaming it all. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.299
 in other government type things the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 university teachers in the system and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.140
 in fact sometimes that's the way it is 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.270
 we think that the university that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.460
 we have today basically follows the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.960
 same models from centuries ago 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 and look at how the world has changed and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 university remains the same 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.390
 I could start a fight to try 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.880
 transform university education 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.100
 our culture and the powers of Sergio 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 that makes the university, but I 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700
 I have another idea once someone 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 said that university is kind a 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.540
 big ship is true 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 You know that is not so easy to do 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.469
 a ship making the curve as there is another 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 way is not why I propose a 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.250
 something else and if we made the curve 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 and not 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.030
 even instead of waiting for the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.280
 university change and we're going to change 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.509
 same from our attitudes and I 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.460
 I think this is a much more 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.230
 interesting is an image that has always 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.030
 was very successful when I share 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.890
 the henchman and she says the university 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.110
 Kind that if you want to have good grades 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.270
 social life and great college Sunday 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.070
 you have to be a detail like take 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.750
 cap but I finally realized that yes 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.640
 there are universities that can 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.900
 balance things well and is 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.940
 issue of details 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.770
 Good, I do not think so, I like 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.840
 call these college people 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.090
 active and if it is possible to be a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.560
 to be active without giving too many people 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.450
 writes that it identifies a lot 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 What do I talk to my friends? 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.800
 videos on the things that happen to me 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.870
 well I thought the following is very simple 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.370
 if they identify with the problems 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.230
 I hope they also identify 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.720
 with the solutions so I decided to put together 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.750
 all these my ideas have started more 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.459
 new project the active university 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.110
 through this new project we will 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.760
 to be able to talk in a little way 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.100
 closest to everything that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.780
 disrupts our plans as a lack of 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.810
 motivation an organization of time 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.730
 progress of the nation life is not healthy 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.920
 doubt about the future we can with 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.840
 college and more and look for 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.280
 solutions attitudes to be 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.959
 more complete universities 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.549
 active university 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.709
 We're going to have a fanpage blog. 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.019
 lectures and events a world of things 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.790
 yes why not because no people 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.130
 but I decided to start doing what I 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.870
 I like videos the first time 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.570
 University Novelty Article I 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.010
 I decided to call the challenge and I know 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.049
 inscribed a little different, right? 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.970
 But because it 's written like this it 's good in 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.829
 The next two weeks I'm going to do ten 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.959
 videos talking a little more about these 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.459
 problems that surround our lives and 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.110
 comment on some of the things I 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.390
 I imagine they can help us on the day 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.350
 days are short videos to 26 minutes 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.910
 I know you have a lot to 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.500
 do and study right? 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.510
 but little by little we can do 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.250
 big things so to start me 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.019
 I want you to write down here. 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.940
 Can you be on YouTube on facebook? 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.890
 sign up hashtag I am the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.970
 active university and also the name of the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.500
 your university 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.660
 I'm sure we've seen 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.560
 several assets all over Brazil and so 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.480
 decided to finish 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.040
 access the link in the description will have one 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.260
 where you will be able to see all the videos 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.970
 of the challenge project in the coming weeks 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.670
 and links to track everything 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.440
 will happen do not miss anything beauty 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.540
 as well as everything I've done to date only 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.799
 it makes sense if you got there from the other 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.199
 side because together we can 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.750
 turn ideas into concepts and more than 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.090
 everything attitudes together we can do 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.820
 much bigger things right 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.820
 well then come with me, active university
