00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.820
 electric circuit board cars from 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.800
 short circuit serves 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.900
 circuit breakers 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.119
 car fuse or 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.980
 you auto fuse this device 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.660
 which by the destruction of one or 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.490
 several specially designed 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.090
 elements breaks the circuit in which not 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.570
 included 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.829
 disconnect the current when it exceeds the specified 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 value over enough 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.480
 long time 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 currently uses automotive 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.410
 several types and fuses 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 the most common ones 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.620
 are flag or knife 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.960
 knife fuses come in different 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.269
 sizes and denominations for example 1 2 3 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.860
 amperes and so on 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.820
 fuse used in 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.229
 cars from 5 to 30 amps 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.489
 fuses may be located in 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.869
 different places of the car as a rule 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.310
 main locations 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:04.320
 fuse 2 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.230
 first place is necessarily a salon 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030
 car in the area of ​​the front panel 2 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.910
 may be in the cabin in the luggage area 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.470
 Branch or under the hood when choosing 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.050
 fuses should be considered 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.330
 The following features first 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.860
 fuses rated voltage 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.860
 must be at least nominal 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.570
 network voltage in the second nominal 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.020
 current fuses must be at least 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 rated current setting 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 car fuses installed 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.410
 in motor circuits should be checked by 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.860
 motor starting current that is not 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.600
 must burn out with a normal gun 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.640
 when multiple fuses are on 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.830
 they must be checked consistently 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.260
 on the selectivity that is started the mountain 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.990
 View car fuses 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.400
 closest short circuit location 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.400
 car fuses are located 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.660
 in the primary circuit of a power transformer 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 must withstand 10-fold 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.790
 rated primary current for 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.650
 one-tenth of a second by Jews such 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.300
 the fuse rating must 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.270
 be slightly lower time totals 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.590
 load characteristics 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.479
 fuse are selected from 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.670
 standard row with the nearest 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.420
 rated current operation 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.420
 exceeding the values ​​obtained
