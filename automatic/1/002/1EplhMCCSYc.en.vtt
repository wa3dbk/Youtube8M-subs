00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
having that many chances I think we

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.069

the<00:00:41.140> poster<00:00:41.650> I<00:00:42.010> would<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.640> very<00:00:42.820> very<00:00:43.390> difficult

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
the poster I would a very very difficult

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.229 
the poster I would a very very difficult
cross<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.350> then<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:45.280> second<00:00:45.550> temple<00:00:45.670> was<00:00:45.820> had

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
cross and then the second temple was had

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.210 
cross and then the second temple was had
another<00:00:46.480> one<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.840> corner<00:00:46.960> kick<00:00:47.199> fate<00:00:48.100> of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
another one in the corner kick fate of

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.040 
another one in the corner kick fate of
the<00:00:48.370> line<00:00:48.550> but<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:48.970> think<00:00:49.239> part<00:00:49.629> from<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.839> other

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
the line but I think part from the other

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.200 
the line but I think part from the other
was<00:00:50.199> in<00:00:50.379> that<00:00:50.830> much<00:00:51.070> for<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.790> strikers<00:00:52.180> in

I think you ask those guys they say
that's<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.270> LA<00:03:55.450> guys<00:03:55.660> they'd<00:03:55.870> say<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.110> same

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
that's the LA guys they'd say the same

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.740 
that's the LA guys they'd say the same
thing<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.910> know<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.210> we<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.420> we'd<00:03:58.720> have

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
thing you know it so we have we'd have

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.190 
thing you know it so we have we'd have
most<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.260> play<00:04:00.540> but<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.720> know<00:04:01.840> they<00:04:01.960> snuck

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
most of the play but you know they snuck

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.720 
most of the play but you know they snuck
one<00:04:02.230> early<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.770> defend<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.160> well<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.460> front<00:04:03.670> of

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
one early and defend it well in front of

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.430 
one early and defend it well in front of
their<00:04:03.850> goal<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.240> they<00:04:04.840> get<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.080> three<00:04:05.260> points

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
their goal and they get the three points

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.900 
their goal and they get the three points
so<00:04:05.680> obviously<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.430> know<00:04:06.550> they<00:04:06.670> come<00:04:06.820> out
