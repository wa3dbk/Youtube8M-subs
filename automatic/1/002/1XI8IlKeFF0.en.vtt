00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:15.499
 space for this also the liked rights for the videogame transposition of the 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.769
 from the sci-fi series of star trek the next generetion 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.369
 one of the most loved of the whole sager aidp land today own berry 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.880
 and what gives rise to a sort of shooter connan of accessory elements 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.280
 as the plan of tra 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.650
 for members of the rocchetta staff 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.970
 in the ass but the control of the gold job details in the end everything is 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.910
 reduces to a spatial guide and with but if there is the snake trembles surely it is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 quite popular for fans of the show 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.520
 how to see there are also sections 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.049
 a little bit chrysolite like this puzzle game 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.700
 what you need 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 correctly pass these spark 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 wario certainly interesting 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.390
 star trek universe I also embrace the portable case what you see 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.039
 next-generation hired in lire 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.480
 but there are some episodes 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.920
 come out even for the normal you want most 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.659
 a kind of tutorial for using the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.290
 I'll take you big, the big bridge 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.259
 of the price body 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.850
 enthusiastic product dedicated exclusively to enthusiasts of course 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.500
 commercial interest per cent and s not remains strong but matlab below is not done 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.050
 tie a crazy that publication that wants you with a site like this others 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.890
 retweets 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.549
 that a simulation of remote controlled cars which 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.119
 throws second jim opposite numbers worth so circuits and try to conquer 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.560
 the first position 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.930
 the title is and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.840
 fairly well known, although not always appreciated for making his own 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.750
 the quality is made of leisure facilities 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.700
 however 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.659
 definitely commercial success with regards to 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.659
 the app store speakers 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.110
 after the master system and once a month between the first game of the game of 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.379
 debut of all this the deep-mas intences 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.919
 layer of a simulation. timing in which the field framed by the 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.779
 shoulders of 1 of 2 players 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:24.759
 is 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.579
 therefore with a three-dimensional seondo effect 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.579
 the game is quite fun rather complicated but 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.409
 definitely a good game a good debut for the home 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.079
 the search for the lost popslut continues 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.919
 towards the licenses for converted movies in video games this here indeed broke 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:59.279
 a fiction - sun-metric rice commit in how much to use rotating e 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.319
 earth work toys 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.169
 get rid of the threat 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.999
 however, there are other biagio players than carabinieri webmail 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.359
 ingenious, very entertaining, typically also well done although not too much 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.099
 inspired by design factors 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.099
 meetic 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.040
 blessed reform that you call this time superb 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.930
 ex senator episode cvt auctions dedicated therefore to super nintendo mega drive 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:36.179
 and very well done the graphics and as always excellent has a nice game does not change 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.860
 much and no need even to change since 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.169
 it was pretty much perfect as it is 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.969
 however, the aesthetic impact is even more remarkable this time 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.370
 all dining set at the time of the Gulf War 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.739
 do 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.189
 game is booked two or more than a year after the outbreak of the conflict 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.250
 and immersed in ita 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.519
 therefore of the players 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.519
 probably increased by this historical context 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.999
 game webcam that knew yet another sequel. the supergatto type 2 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.889
 here the color of the graphic remains once again 3 rough levels 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.329
 quality 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.609
 the game remains just as fun of some intermezzo size too 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.249
 within the same mission 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.900
 and it all really came out like 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.900
 as always for this 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 and this saga is that it is still the final episode 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.560
 you too can one day all 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.520
 so he resumed for a next-generation episode but 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.780
 obviously not 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.330
 we can not 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 face too much reliance 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.510
 after the supergatto tank the hamsik I try to tackle the theme of the pelic also 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.719
 from the point of view of ideas with this hunger, 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.449
 that I a hand. flight simulation hunting hunts 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.120
 but in which the super ego 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.580
 venerate exploited rao 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.389
 a very close manner and on the highest possible levels 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.639
 hey hey 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.249
 fundamentally date of 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:18.459
 simulation game and manga title validation equal surely the experience 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.739
 of play among other things there is also very robust also because here in the in the 

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:23.990
 to propose 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.469
 cinematic details of some moments 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.469
 motel so this is definitely a product to try 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.850
 going completely gender we return to talk about driving simulation 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.979
 equilac notice space offers you the price per square meter for that evening 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.419
 rather driving title 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.559
 simulative as spirit 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.949
 fondant possibility to change settings to feel better 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:53.979
 your machine 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.349
 is 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.589
 the destruction of the tracks tries to be 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.080
 quite faithful 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.199
 and the graphics unfortunately photo 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.520
 the use of mozzecane is not very refined 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.419
 is 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:07.520
 good looking 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.569
 iphoto more than moving e 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.370
 tac rachide falzone all coded screen 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.370
 this happened years ago 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.770
 at this black point of the 16-bit consoles begins to bolt towards his 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.570
 sunset 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.660
 elco also makes the destiny of the last product of this 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.569
 home the ground test 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.349
 the consol super nintendo in 1996 so in full it was playstation 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.960
 eligio which is very nice fun - a fool of me how much I love you 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.610
 to make ghost-shaped monster change but according to the need to know how to drive 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.969
 poiter on the best way dad 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:54.060
 protagonist 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.160
 paola co-star of the game for a distant child in the film 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.110
 is 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.539
 all very funny 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.770
 pity to see the talent bellaa absolut no pay 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.770
 in the bitter &amp; lt income statement 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.669
 thanks again for your attention I hope you find out if you are up 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.160
 terni next appointment
