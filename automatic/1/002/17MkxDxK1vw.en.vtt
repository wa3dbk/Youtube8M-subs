00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and that's an expensive repair so design

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.650 
and that's an expensive repair so design
this<00:00:20.369> mesh<00:00:20.609> grille<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> looks<00:00:21.210> good<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
this mesh grille that looks good and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
this mesh grille that looks good and
gives<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> some<00:00:22.170> protection<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.460> you've<00:00:23.580> got

gives you some protection so you've got
four<00:00:23.970> pins<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> top<00:00:24.900> here<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:26.010> up

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
four pins at the top here they go up

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
four pins at the top here they go up
into<00:00:26.609> some<00:00:26.789> holes<00:00:27.029> I'll<00:00:27.300> show<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.779> a

fits in the car so the tabs hook under
this<00:00:38.730> panel<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.290> round<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this panel here so they go round and for

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
this panel here so they go round and for
country<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> ones<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> top

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
country and then the ones at the top

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.729 
country and then the ones at the top
there's<00:00:43.649> actually<00:00:44.190> these<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.399> holes<00:00:44.969> here

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
there's actually these little holes here

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.060 
there's actually these little holes here
in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> top<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:49.350> fill<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> make<00:00:49.860> sure<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
in the top so to fill it make sure the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
in the top so to fill it make sure the
tabs<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.140> it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
tabs are up out of the way and then it's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.110

done now starting to play door okay and
if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.270> find<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:58.620> find<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.250> pins

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
if you find them find where these pins

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.330 
if you find them find where these pins
line<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.719> into<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> hole<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
slot it in there hey and then this end

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.390 
slot it in there hey and then this end
one<00:01:05.570> if<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:09.860> slot<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
one if we get it right slot that one in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
one if we get it right slot that one in
that's<00:01:12.119> three<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> eight<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.930> they<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
