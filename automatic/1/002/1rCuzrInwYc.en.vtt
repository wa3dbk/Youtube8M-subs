half a cup of honey butter for three

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
half a cup of honey butter for three
minutes<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.789> it<00:01:41.909> nice<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.119> warm<00:01:48.200> flour

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
minutes to get it nice and warm flour

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.359 
minutes to get it nice and warm flour
that<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.829> milled<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.819> greens<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:52.369> yeah
