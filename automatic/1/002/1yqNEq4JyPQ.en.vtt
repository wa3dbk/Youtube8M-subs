00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.730 
pickup change to the EMG 57 66 pickups
okay<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.570> more<00:01:29.689> vintage<00:01:30.020> sounding<00:01:30.470> van

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
okay so that more vintage sounding van

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.830 
okay so that more vintage sounding van
it's<00:01:31.250> still<00:01:31.549> a<00:01:31.580> negative<00:01:32.030> 1<00:01:32.119> cup<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:32.659> still

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
it's still a negative 1 cup it's still

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.330 
it's still a negative 1 cup it's still
an<00:01:32.960> active<00:01:33.080> pickup<00:01:33.590> but<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:33.890> much<00:01:34.100> more

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
an active pickup but it's much more

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.419 
an active pickup but it's much more
organic<00:01:34.670> sounding<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.740> just<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.070> sounds

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
organic sounding and it just it sounds

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.270 
organic sounding and it just it sounds
better<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.700> me<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:38.179> much<00:01:38.330> cleaner<00:01:38.659> sounding

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
better to me it's much cleaner sounding

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.490 
better to me it's much cleaner sounding
the<00:01:40.280> guitar<00:01:40.700> comes<00:01:41.000> with<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.450> Floyd<00:01:41.810> Rose<00:01:41.840> or<00:01:42.470> a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
the guitar comes with a Floyd Rose or a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.460 
the guitar comes with a Floyd Rose or a
standard<00:01:43.130> hipshot<00:01:43.549> bridge<00:01:44.110> hipshot<00:01:45.110> bridges

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
standard hipshot bridge hipshot bridges

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.870 
standard hipshot bridge hipshot bridges
are<00:01:45.619> cooler<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:45.979> think<00:01:46.310> because<00:01:46.520> they<00:01:46.640> sit

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
are cooler I think because they sit

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.730 
are cooler I think because they sit
closer<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.569> body<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.530> much<00:01:48.709> easier

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
closer to the body and it's much easier

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.109 
closer to the body and it's much easier
