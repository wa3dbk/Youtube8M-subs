00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.660
Hi Everyone! Kristina here. Welcome to another video
on my YouTube channel. Today I'm using this

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.539
new stamp set from Paper Smooches called Lots
of Love. I'm going to be using this sentiment

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.980
right here that has the overlapping letters.
I'm also going to be using one stamp from

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.310
the same stamps that you guys have seen me
use in my lasts few card videos. I'm using

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.900
this diagonal border stamp. I'm going to be
stamping it just onto some white card stock

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.529
and in order to know where I am going to be
placing that I using this circle die. I'm

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.270
actually going to be cutting out a circle
and having that I Love You underneath. So,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.070
I just wanted to pencil on that circle so
I knew exactly what I was dealing with. I'm

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.210
using 4 different colors of Simon Says Stamp
ink here. They are all grays and blacks. Starting

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.830
with the lightest color, which is Fog. Then
I moved to Smoke. The next color was Slate

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.180
and then the darkest color was Black. After
I had those stamped I moved onto that I Love

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.330
You sentiment. I'm stamping this one in StazOn
ink, because I am going to be I'm going to

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.120
be using some Distress Markers and adding
a little bit of Wink of Stella over top, which

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.310
gets that ink moving. So I wanted to make
sure I used a permanent waterproof ink that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.890
wouldn't have any problems with smearing or
smudging. I stamped this on some white card

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.920
stock as well. I'm going to be using a few
different colors of Distress Ink. The first

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.690
color is Festive Berries. I'm not going to
be adding these colors with water right away.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.420
I'm going to color straight onto the cardstock
as if I was just going to use it as a straight

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.850
marker. So I used Spiced Marmalade and then
also Squeezed Lemonade. I'm sort of doing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.750
just a rainbow color effect here. I'm going
to be mixing up which colors I'm using. So

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.970
I've got Mowed Lawn and Peacock Feathers.
The last color I used was Chipped Sapphire.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.479
Then I'll start repeating colors, because
I want to make sure that I get all of these

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.340
areas colored in. At first when I was coloring
this I thought of those overlapping and creating

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.340
to color in between, but once I got down to
the second word, the Y-O-U, it was a little

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.870
hard to figure out how I was going to do that
without having the same color side by side

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.480
above. So I ended up just using whatever colors
I needed. I also took my Gelly Roll White

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.439
pen and I added some small dots and some big
dots just onto a few of the letters. Then

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.310
I brought in that Wink of Stella and I should
have done the dots afterword, because they

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.049
are going to kind of gets lost a little bit.
But the effect still was cool. So I went with

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:39.049
it. This Wink of Stella Clear Glitter Brush
Pen adds moisture to the Distress Inks, so

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.739
it gets it moving a little bit and smears
and smudges a little bit. You'll see it most

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.409
when I go to color the E here. Kind of starts
to move that red ink into the yellow. I thought

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.279
that it looked really really cool and gives
it kind of a fun effect. You can also see

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.809
it down here with the red and purple going
into that blue and then I'm just coloring

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.579
into that U. I also went back to the beginning
and kind of smeared that a little bit so that

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.879
the colors would move a little bit more than
they had been. I used my white pen just to

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.599
clean up that area that went outside the lines.
Then I moved on to the rest of the card. So

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.620
here I am going back to the circle die cut
and I'm just going to hold this die down to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.099
my card stock here with some Post-it tape.
Then I ran it through my Big Shot machine

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.019
to cut the circle. In order to put that I
Love You behind it I trimmed out that area

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.549
and then put some foam adhesive around it
and now I'm just positioning that circle window

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.480
piece over top and then I erased that pencil
mark that I had just to let me know where

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.340
that circle was going to be. After I had all
of that ready I put the adhesive on the back

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.150
of this piece. This is going to go directly
over the top of the card front. So I just

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.239
needed some more foam adhesive around the
outside edge. The card base is made out of

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.419
the same white card stock that I've been using
for the rest of the card, which is Bazzill

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:04.329
Marshmallow. I just created a top folding
card. Then I put some regular adhesive behind

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.849
the I Love You since that had the foam on
the front of the I Love You so I didn't need

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.059
to add any foam to that area. Then I pressed
it down onto the front of this card. Now I

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.979
thought at this point I might be finished
with the card, but then I decided that I wanted

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.039
to bring in a little bit more of that rainbow
color to the other areas of the card, so I

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:30.039
decided to first draw some dash around that
circle. Just to emphasize it. So that as I

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.970
added colored sequin that the edge wouldn't
get lost. I added just a bunch of different

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.289
sequins. Including some silver stars sequins.
In order to adhere those down I used some

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.650
Ranger Matte Multi Medium and I put that on
some scratch paper and then smudged it with

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.979
my finger so that the glue would kind of spread
out. Then I used my QuickStik tool to pick

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.300
up those different sequins drag them in the
adhesive and then place it back on to my card.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.840
This is what I lovingly call "Card Surgery".
You guys have seen me do this before in the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.650
past with other sequins and I think itâ€™s
the best way to adhere sequins because they

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.610
stay put, even through the mail. So that is
my card for today. I hope you guys enjoyed.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.780
This is another one of those cards where I
wasn't liking how it turned out, so I put

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.699
it away and came back a couple days later
and finished it off. I hope you guys enjoyed

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.979
and I will see you guys on Monday for a new
video.
