00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 panda in which store lies all 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.710
 buy stuff dot kazgu of course oh 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.260
 there with expert.ru link to it is in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.630
 describing great prices and a lot of cool 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.490
 things zdarova gangsters our challenge 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 called VVD because we are fast 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 we can fly to any point of them 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.730
 attacking opponents from the air surprising 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.820
 very much our whole team gathered 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 Tara was and tell you honestly what 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.199
 probably there should always be some lassos 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.550
 I'm just thinking what peak can be 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.380
 in the top three so as not to be needed at least 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 alone arcane on the team and can not you even 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 think that some arcana is always very 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.890
 need here they are missing more than that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.050
 one of the conditions of the peak was that we 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 must try to want periodically suddenly 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 I understand the bird 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 beatmaster we took no master flew 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 there are no problems on his bird 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 really have some interest in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 this scenario because you throw 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.010
 anti bird in the rear of the enemy in the forest so 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.460
 more that she can hide it not so 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 too, and huge tvarin not like some 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 there mothers are very big and immediately 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.969
 you arrive at the bird trunks 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 calm up to the whole team in peter and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.840
 you start ganking of course we are not so 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.820
 the team is not my gunk squad yes no us 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.270
 all sorts of strong nukers let's 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 nexo 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.040
 but no less than that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.729
 we have tenacious necrophos there are 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 living omniknight well and respectively 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.630
 household kerry spectrum and the rest 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.490
 feels good too 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 great not the most boring challenge 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 because flying all over the map 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.570
 I've always had enough fun 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.579
 I liked such mechanics only 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 that probably if it were not a condition 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.390
 collect 7 failures I would take furion with 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.159
 lasso because manga is a little bit 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 There is not enough faryon, too, throughout 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.360
 the map can fly and it was not big 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.189
 disadvantage at the call level 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 which I see in the comments seemed 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 I was less interesting though I won 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.479
 we are fairly easy in ordinary public 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.770
 from the first time of particular difficulties whether 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.360
 we are so cool either 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.030
 opponents were enough 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.710
 weak although the card was less on 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.380
 the work we have such Picchu enough 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.540
 extraordinary but cheerful waiting for interesting 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.160
 calls comments causing which 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.200
 I really want to play but from those 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.880
 which I liked you can 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.350
 watch a couple of videos about taver and me 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.240
 I liked it so much when all the taver should 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.950
 you know how to stand with courier too 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.610
 Here is a reference can watch it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.190
 the courier must live with you and die with 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.930
 ssylochku opponent took a look but interesting 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.580
 call guys i've seriously read 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.580
 so let's get an interesting challenge
