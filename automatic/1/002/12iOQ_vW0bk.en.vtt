here as you can see originally what I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.460 
here as you can see originally what I
was<00:00:23.070> doing<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:24.300> taping<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.900> whole<00:00:24.930> thing<00:00:25.289> off

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
was doing was taping the whole thing off

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
was doing was taping the whole thing off
and<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.070> having<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.460> sit<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.210> i

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and just having it sit like this and i

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.490 
and just having it sit like this and i
was<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.510> paint<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.349> then

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
was going to paint it like that but then

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.299 
was going to paint it like that but then
I<00:00:28.760> realize<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.109> these<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:31.710> come<00:00:32.009> off

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I realize that these actually come off

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
I realize that these actually come off
there's<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> little<00:00:33.390> pin<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> I'm

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
there's a little pin there and I'm

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
there's a little pin there and I'm
really<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.710> sure<00:00:34.770> exactly<00:00:35.370> how<00:00:35.610> easy<00:00:35.820> they're

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really not sure exactly how easy they're

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
really not sure exactly how easy they're
going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> go<00:00:36.360> back<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> hope<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.320> not

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
going to go back on and I hope it's not

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.930 
going to go back on and I hope it's not
as<00:00:37.800> hard<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.850> but

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
as hard as I think it's going to be but

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.670 
as hard as I think it's going to be but
basically<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> only<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
basically this is the only one that I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
basically this is the only one that I
couldn't<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.280> off<00:00:44.309> some<00:00:44.820> pride<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.210> going

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
couldn't get off some pride it's going

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
couldn't get off some pride it's going
to<00:00:45.360> leave<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> tape<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.590> off

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to leave it like that and tape it off

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.459 
to leave it like that and tape it off
the<00:00:47.010> rest<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.809> but<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> don't

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the rest of the way but if you don't

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
the rest of the way but if you don't
remember<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.860> last<00:00:49.890> video<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.149> doing

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
remember the last video what I'm doing

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.799 
remember the last video what I'm doing
is<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:52.860> finished

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
is here this is one that's finished

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.040 
is here this is one that's finished
ready<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.219> be<00:00:56.219> primed<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> painted<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.420> Joe<00:00:57.930> if

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
ready to be primed and painted a Joe if

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.299 
ready to be primed and painted a Joe if
to<00:00:58.199> sand<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.010> back<00:00:59.280> side

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to sand a little bit on that back side

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
to sand a little bit on that back side
but<00:00:59.730> that's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> biggest<00:01:00.420> deal<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.980> see

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
but that's not the biggest deal and see

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.230 
but that's not the biggest deal and see
the<00:01:02.070> cooler<00:01:02.309> master<00:01:02.730> logo<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:05.210> got<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the cooler master logo here it's got a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.380 
the cooler master logo here it's got a
little<00:01:06.390> depressed<00:01:06.960> edge<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:09.000> logo

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
little depressed edge around the logo

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.679 
little depressed edge around the logo
and<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> did<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:11.909> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> use

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
sure that none of the pain bleeds

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.810 
through or you know messes up any of
these<00:01:25.650> edges<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.520> edges

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
these edges because I want these edges

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.140 
these edges because I want these edges
to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.060> real<00:01:27.240> clean<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> I'm<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
to be real clean and I'm going to do the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.370 
to be real clean and I'm going to do the
anything<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.479> black<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> be

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
anything you see black is going to be

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.899 
anything you see black is going to be
whatever<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> color<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.070> decide<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.759> with

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
whatever the color I decide to go with

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.020 
whatever the color I decide to go with
I'm<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.360> sure<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> color<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.560> yet

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
I'm not sure what the color will be yet

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.200 
I'm not sure what the color will be yet
and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:36.990> stay<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.890> gloss<00:01:38.520> black<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and this will stay the gloss black of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
and this will stay the gloss black of
the<00:01:39.540> plastic<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.100> that'll

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the plastic there so I think that'll

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.770 
the plastic there so I think that'll
kind<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.729> give<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.119> cool<00:01:42.420> unique

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
kind of give it a really cool unique

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.649 
kind of give it a really cool unique
