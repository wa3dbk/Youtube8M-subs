00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.900
 what kind of demons will come in search 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.200
 you better be happy no one would get along 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.360

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.420

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.190
 [Music] 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.530
 and who helped the fragments of the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.600
 pearl is capricious aggressive and nothing 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.820

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.410
 break 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
 and it was that campaign 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.220
 I think it went over something or it was 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.220
 My imagination 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 [Music] 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.760

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.630
 heal you clearly I saw how they gave you a 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.610
 beating in that fight you would see yourself accept it 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.100
 because you do not forget that I won that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.400

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.350
 [Music] 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.420
 it seems that my life has improved hopefully 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.510
 can recover the arms of the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.800
 pelagic and as you are very young 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.229
 to worry 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180
 I hope there is no jaume get better 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:19.480
 so the problem will be solved more 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.480
 fast and much more 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.390
 I see that their relationship improved earlier than 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.390
 what I expected 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.319
 good 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.390
 is that way you do not understand that my body 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.390
 It's special, look, I do not have anything 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.220
 you're fine right, you did not have the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.379
 scars that made you with that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.720
 sword is admirable 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.640
 clear because I'm not human like you 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.190
 and I'm not interested in being surprised by 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 my condition one is not human nor is it 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.980
 beast had never seen something like that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.129

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.210

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.610
 because you did that I should not have done it 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.300
 [Music] 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.910
 so there is a man who tries 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.620
 open the grave of my father as a project 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.500
 from the grave and he remained all the time 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.050
 there warned to warn him not to lie 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.030
 I bet you saw the grave not because 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.340
 that is just a stone grave its 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.530
 remains are found elsewhere and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.710
 where his remains are found not 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.440
 I know, I do not have the faintest idea 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.170
 what kind of visitors this and not already 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.150

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.840
 monstrous dog that appeared at the base 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.840

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.310
 I do not remember much about that 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.109
 event his father was one of the 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.870
 best-known beasts in all the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.660
 history since I lived on its succulent 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.030

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.250

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.380

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.380

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.730
 true 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.760
 she always acts like this when someone 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.760

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.070

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.940
