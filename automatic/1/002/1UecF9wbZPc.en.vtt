00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.529 
this is a little cove or cave and stuff
like<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.039> not<00:00:59.039> really<00:00:59.250> sure<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.640> there's<00:01:00.180> any

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
like that not really sure if there's any

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.110 
like that not really sure if there's any
you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.140> stuff<00:01:01.500> inside<00:01:01.800> since<00:01:02.160> well<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> don't

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you know stuff inside since well I don't

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.810 
you know stuff inside since well I don't
use<00:01:03.300> x-ray<00:01:03.989> stuff<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.400> can't<00:01:05.610> know

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
use x-ray stuff so I really can't know

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
use x-ray stuff so I really can't know
it<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.720> however<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> was<00:01:07.770> spawning

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it but this however when I was spawning

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
it but this however when I was spawning
for<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:08.909> reason<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.450> weird<00:01:09.659> chunk

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
for some reason I have these weird chunk

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
for some reason I have these weird chunk
loading<00:01:10.380> errors<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.189> tend<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.090> these

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
loading errors so I tend to have these

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.859 
loading errors so I tend to have these
weird<00:01:12.570> x-ray<00:01:13.049> glitches<00:01:13.439> every<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.159> often<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
weird x-ray glitches every so often that

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.950 
weird x-ray glitches every so often that
every<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:15.990> often<00:01:16.200> excuse<00:01:17.189> me<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:18.360> realized

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
every so often excuse me and I realized

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.460 
every so often excuse me and I realized
that<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.710> abandoned<00:01:20.220> mine<00:01:21.049> shaft<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that this is a abandoned mine shaft I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.580 
that this is a abandoned mine shaft I
think<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.780> down<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.409> right

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
think if we go down there it is right

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.670 
think if we go down there it is right
here<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.610> coordinates<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.570> X<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
here so the coordinates of this is X of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.050 
here so the coordinates of this is X of
134<00:01:29.280> why<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.030> 27<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.780> z<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.290> 150<00:01:31.770> about<00:01:32.159> four<00:01:32.430> so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
134 why of 27 and z of 150 about four so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.890 
134 why of 27 and z of 150 about four so
that's<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> coordinates<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.600> area

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that's the coordinates of this area

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.499 
that's the coordinates of this area
right<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.680> course<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> mineshaft<00:01:38.509> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
right here of course this mineshaft of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.990 
right here of course this mineshaft of
it<00:01:39.659> obviously<00:01:39.780> goes<00:01:40.380> somewhere<00:01:41.220> else<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it obviously goes somewhere else so the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.899 
it obviously goes somewhere else so the
coordinates<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:43.170> change<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.369> was

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
coordinates will not change but I was

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.819 
coordinates will not change but I was
actually<00:01:45.090> exploring<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:45.960> area<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.649> bit

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
actually exploring this area just a bit

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.670 
actually exploring this area just a bit
about<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> few<00:01:48.270> minutes<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> i<00:01:49.380> found

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
about you know a few minutes and i found

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.969 
about you know a few minutes and i found
this<00:01:50.090> emerald<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.170> seed<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> awesome

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this emerald so this seed is awesome

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.910 
this emerald so this seed is awesome
because<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:54.119> find<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.920> exposed

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
because of that you find one exposed

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.420 
because of that you find one exposed
emerald<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.000> awesome<00:01:57.270> um<00:01:58.189> let's<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.369> if

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
emerald which is awesome um let's see if

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.889 
emerald which is awesome um let's see if
we<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.880> further<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> haven't<00:02:00.780> really

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
we can go on further I haven't really

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
we can go on further I haven't really
you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:02.009> went<00:02:02.490> further<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.060> since<00:02:04.520> this

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you know went further on since this
