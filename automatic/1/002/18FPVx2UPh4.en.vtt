it had its engine rebuilt a couple of
months<00:00:48.780> ago<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.940> that's<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.090> been<00:00:51.780> written

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
months ago and that's only been written

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.530

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
about six or seven times after that so

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.459 
about six or seven times after that so
yeah<00:00:58.790> so<00:00:59.790> uh<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.510> work<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.260> done

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
yeah so uh the work that has to be done

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.100 
yeah so uh the work that has to be done
on<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.430> does<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.059> idle<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
on it is it does not want an idle so

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.329 
on it is it does not want an idle so
it's<00:01:04.530> probably<00:01:04.829> has<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.100> something<00:01:05.250> with

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it's probably has to do something with

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.090

the<00:01:05.519> car<00:01:05.759> either<00:01:06.000> has<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.509> cleaned<00:01:06.810> out

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the car either has to be cleaned out

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.949 
the car either has to be cleaned out
adjusted<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.340> maybe<00:01:08.999> something<00:01:09.359> else<00:01:09.509> but

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:09.959 
adjusted or maybe something else but

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.929 
adjusted or maybe something else but

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.050 
was me just holding the throttle to keep
it<00:02:47.060> idling<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.599> once<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.840> got<00:02:47.989> off<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.319> died

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
it idling but once I got off it died

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.210 
it idling but once I got off it died
one<00:02:50.780> possibility<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.319> just<00:02:51.530> realized<00:02:51.829> is<00:02:52.010> it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
one possibility I just realized is it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.220 
one possibility I just realized is it
could<00:02:52.400> be<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.549> throttle<00:02:53.030> kind<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.840> Wiggly<00:02:54.110> so

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
could be the throttle kind of Wiggly so

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.039 
could be the throttle kind of Wiggly so
I<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.470> tighten<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.890> throttle<00:02:55.220> cable

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
I have to tighten the throttle cable

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.289 
I have to tighten the throttle cable
