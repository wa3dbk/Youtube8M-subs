00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.119
 after this years 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.200
 just keep the oil in the pan and then we'll 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.480

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.120

 now sends a profit in the pot then your 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.760
 pocket to stay transparent was to 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.530
 people are looking for before placing or 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.590
 our rice will also play volleyball had 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.510
 your purists who will tell you that the 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.950
 oil does not go into the risotto anything 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:13.060
 no face there goes well everything at that point 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.060
 people come in with your bag 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.860
 the guy has to be the arboreal rice one 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.159
 super chubby thing and then what happens 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.560
 He has a lot of friends in him and he has starch. 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.390
 suffers a process of gelation is the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.330
 that makes everything much more creamy our 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.710
 risotto and to release much of it 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.070
 We always have to keep stirring. 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.540
 because he was kind of scrubbing and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.210
 releasing friend so that's why 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.890
 People are putting water thigh by thigh and 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.360
 is always stirring it to release 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.500
 whole family and leave our other 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.009
 very creamy 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.899
 now I'm going to have to pack fine, you always think 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.580
 I did not see what you got to drink. 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.830
 drive your most expensive wine of all but 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.770
 also does not go in that wine section and 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.880
 five reais and here I will use the most 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.880
 even from the market 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.670
 it's time to enter the first half 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.380
 whole of a little piece of salt that we 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.700
 will adjust in the end so it's just for 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:25.110
 get everything perfect from the kingdom too 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:28.560
 three drops only so that the river 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.290
 already it was almost all so now I go 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.280

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 with two first 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.400
 as soon as the doctor 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.900
 now I'll start cooking I put 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.970
 two shells because now we go 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.920
 start putting our arguments 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.290
 I to here two varieties the mushroom 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.480
 paris the mushroom is normal that it turns 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.209

 city what is in the safe region 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.260
 any more successful mushroom will stay 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.870

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.120

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.410
 for the collection and cutting of a force 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.970
 He wants to be nice with Shimeji. 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.180
 Like it already, neither will I stay. 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.489
 poking it I'll just take them to quote 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.569
 Linen it comes stuck in the background you 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.170
 can literally take off just broke 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.170
 a little 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.920
 the mushrooms may seem much now 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.870
 but my 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.250
 they will belch they will incorporate 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.110
 well with our rice then it will stay 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.050
 much time income 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:01.150
 Look, it just started to dry. 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:01.150
 with another thigh and then she has that 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.650
 arrived about halfway through the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.750
 the fourth thigh and put the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.440
 People can already enter with the mushrooms. 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.750
 without false modesty it puts all the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:21.980
 others to play with 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.020
 Looks like a mushroom, I'm an owl. 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.530
 here's a little spoonful of 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.630
 cause to keep everything moving here 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:35.090
 inside here you get a creamy 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.040
 our mix without putting anything that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.820
 could thicken the broth is just the rice 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.150
 and it is why my in which 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.830
 Arid rice and 71 calmo and the broth is 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.780
 Do you think it's getting too low? 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.970
 complete and with water then you need 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.920
 always be doing like the shell of 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.810
 silver mixing everything and releasing more 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.010
 rice friend, leaving your creamier 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.010
 treasure the final phase of the sewer I turned off 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.570
 of the fire but its seasoning a little bit 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.720
 more just a little pepper if you 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.680
 do you think you need it and then a last 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.100
 with the union 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.770
 it will absorb this broth and look what 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.180
 happens at the end when he needs to 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.180
 be moving right here 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.590
 The school will now incorporate 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.590
 square of butter and parmesan 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:41.290
 beauty blended from that butter absorb 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.840
 can put lock key k here รณ 2000 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.120
 There were a couple of minutes to go. 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.800
 this steam keep working everything there 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.990
 inside mixing everything and it gives a 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.680
 spied and it gets creamier to stay in 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.680
 level that we want 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:15.120
 A risotto for me is one of the most 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.340
 that they invented to put as 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.030
