00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
limited shelf life because of the nature

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.150 
limited shelf life because of the nature
of<00:00:49.200> their<00:00:49.860> composition<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.420> always<00:00:52.230> open<00:00:53.010> up

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.610 
of their composition so always open up
the<00:00:53.340> jar<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.910> soon<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> make

well<00:00:59.160> maybe<00:00:59.460> yeah<00:00:59.760> but<00:00:59.940> anyway<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.359> very

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
well maybe yeah but anyway it's very

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.740 
well maybe yeah but anyway it's very
liquidy<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.770> 2%<00:01:02.160> milk<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.539> want<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
liquidy like 2% milk you don't want to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
liquidy like 2% milk you don't want to
use<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> least<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.890> yellow<00:01:05.159> off

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
use it if it's the least bit yellow off

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.060 
use it if it's the least bit yellow off
color<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:07.140> always<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.950> bit

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
color it will always have a little bit

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
color it will always have a little bit
of<00:01:08.100> an<00:01:08.250> odor<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> ammonia<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.689> the

of an odor from the ammonia which is the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.460 
of an odor from the ammonia which is the
binder<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:11.360> let's<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to wait for that paper to dry here and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
to wait for that paper to dry here and

it so that it hasn't even a little bit
of<00:01:29.340> white<00:01:29.549> paper<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.119> there<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:31.790> will<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
going to be a warm painting I think what

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.969 
going to be a warm painting I think what
I'm<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.079> add<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.590> more

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I'm going to do is add a little more

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.090 
I'm going to do is add a little more
water<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> even<00:01:45.119> though<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.240> tested<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
water with that even though I tested it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.249 
water with that even though I tested it
it's<00:01:47.100> coming<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:48.090> stronger<00:01:48.750> than<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's coming out a little stronger than I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
it's coming out a little stronger than I
had<00:01:49.500> anticipated<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.369> let's<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.180> here

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
had anticipated so let's just going here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.859 
had anticipated so let's just going here
and<00:01:51.450> add<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.930> more<00:01:52.020> water<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> that

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
and add a little bit more water to that

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.649 
and add a little bit more water to that
can<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.170> what<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.470> doing<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> paper

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
can you see what it's doing on the paper

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.469 
can you see what it's doing on the paper
it's<00:01:57.659> doing<00:01:58.049> wonderful<00:01:58.920> blends<00:01:59.479> beautiful

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it's doing wonderful blends beautiful

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.770 
it's doing wonderful blends beautiful
blends<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> let's<00:02:02.549> cancel<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.600> going

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
blends so let's cancel it just going

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.249 
blends so let's cancel it just going
here<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.790> lays<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.719> know<00:02:06.930> you're

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
beautiful color but hopefully it's

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.809 
beautiful color but hopefully it's
look<00:02:12.349> that's<00:02:12.800> getting<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.160> little<00:02:13.280> dark<00:02:13.640> in

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
there let's go over here and clean that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.410 
there let's go over here and clean that
up<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.940> little<00:02:17.090> bit<00:02:18.099> it's<00:02:19.099> still<00:02:19.420> transparent

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
up a little bit it's still transparent

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.699

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
still hopefully shining through going

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.520 
still hopefully shining through going
right<00:02:31.850> over<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.300> top<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.810> gal<00:02:33.080> because

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
right over the top of this gal because

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.690 
right over the top of this gal because
she<00:02:33.709> was<00:02:33.860> coming<00:02:34.190> forward<00:02:34.610> too<00:02:34.819> much<00:02:36.700> going

down<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.150> here<00:02:40.090> don't<00:02:41.090> want<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> line

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
down in here don't want to have a line

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.870 
down in here don't want to have a line
in<00:02:42.380> there<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:43.010> we'll<00:02:43.130> keep<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.519> doing<00:02:43.849> that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
in there so we'll keep on doing that

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.840 
in there so we'll keep on doing that
over<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.630> here<00:02:44.870> quickly<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.459> don't<00:02:46.670> get<00:02:46.790> a

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
over in here quickly so we don't get a

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:55.180 
over in here quickly so we don't get a
hard<00:02:47.090> edge<00:02:47.300> in<00:02:47.510> here<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:54.410> interesting<00:02:54.709> to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
hard edge in here it's interesting to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.190 
hard edge in here it's interesting to
see<00:02:55.400> when<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.730> glaze<00:02:56.030> over<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.450> top<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:57.080> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
see when you glaze over the top of the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.750 
see when you glaze over the top of the
colors<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.739> are<00:02:57.830> underneath<00:02:58.130> there<00:02:58.580> and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
colors that are underneath there and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150 
colors that are underneath there and
what<00:02:59.630> they<00:02:59.810> do<00:02:59.870> here<00:03:00.410> again<00:03:00.650> if<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.920> keep

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
what they do here again if you keep

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.910

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.560 
going with warm on warm and cool on cool
