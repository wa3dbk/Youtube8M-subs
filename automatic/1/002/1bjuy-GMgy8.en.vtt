00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
likely that would ever happen you know
if<00:02:30.840> I'm<00:02:30.989> grinding<00:02:31.260> something<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.070> let's<00:02:32.820> say

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
if I'm grinding something and let's say

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.140 
if I'm grinding something and let's say
if<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.690> piece<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> metal<00:02:34.470> big<00:02:35.400> chunk<00:02:35.730> comes<00:02:35.970> off

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
if a piece of metal big chunk comes off

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970 
if a piece of metal big chunk comes off
I<00:02:36.360> mean<00:02:36.390> there's<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.780> possibility<00:02:37.260> yes<00:02:37.680> it's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
I mean there's a possibility yes it's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.060 
I mean there's a possibility yes it's
going<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:39.020> crack<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.170> glass<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.739> and

that<00:04:50.970> dimensions<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.110> these<00:04:52.260> uh<00:04:52.289> UV<00:04:53.280> filters

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
that dimensions that these uh UV filters

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.379 
that dimensions that these uh UV filters
are<00:04:54.139> like<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.500> loosen<00:04:55.800> one<00:04:55.830> here<00:04:56.070> you'll<00:04:56.389> this

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
are like and loosen one here you'll this

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.500 
are like and loosen one here you'll this
is<00:04:57.539> a<00:04:57.570> 58<00:04:58.440> millimeter<00:04:59.150> but<00:05:00.150> if<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.360> look

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
is a 58 millimeter but if you look

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.600 
is a 58 millimeter but if you look
you'll<00:05:01.320> see<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.650> thread<00:05:01.889> pattern<00:05:02.310> right<00:05:02.460> here

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
you'll see the thread pattern right here

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.820 
you'll see the thread pattern right here
I<00:05:02.820> take<00:05:03.570> my<00:05:03.600> caliper<00:05:04.229> and<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.410> just<00:05:04.590> measure

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
I take my caliper and I just measure

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.800 
I take my caliper and I just measure
from<00:05:05.190> from<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.060> edge<00:05:06.210> right<00:05:06.479> there<00:05:06.539> the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
from from the edge right there the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.070 
from from the edge right there the
thread<00:05:07.020> pattern<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.710> other<00:05:07.830> edge<00:05:08.270> so<00:05:09.270> yeah

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
thread pattern to the other edge so yeah

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.839 
thread pattern to the other edge so yeah
and<00:05:10.349> that<00:05:10.830> will<00:05:10.950> give<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.160> your<00:05:11.340> dimensions

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
and that will give you your dimensions

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.860 
and that will give you your dimensions
for<00:05:12.000> your<00:05:12.210> whole<00:05:12.479> pattern<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.610> can<00:05:14.610> make<00:05:14.789> a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
for your whole pattern so I can make a

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.010 
for your whole pattern so I can make a
use<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.900> hole<00:05:16.200> saw<00:05:16.669> blade<00:05:17.669> or<00:05:17.970> however<00:05:18.599> you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
use a hole saw blade or however you

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.900 
use a hole saw blade or however you
could<00:05:19.380> make<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.560> stencil<00:05:19.919> for<00:05:20.340> using<00:05:20.639> a<00:05:20.700> plasma

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
could make a stencil for using a plasma

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.719 
could make a stencil for using a plasma
cutter<00:05:21.270> or<00:05:21.539> whatnot<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:22.340> haven't<00:05:23.340> got<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:23.639> on

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
cutter or whatnot I haven't got it on

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:33.059 
cutter or whatnot I haven't got it on
there<00:05:23.940> come<00:05:24.180> on<00:05:24.270> there<00:05:25.110> we<00:05:25.169> go

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.279 

those<00:05:34.069> are<00:05:34.190> pretty<00:05:34.370> solid<00:05:34.849> on<00:05:34.970> there<00:05:35.150> but<00:05:36.080> yeah

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
those are pretty solid on there but yeah

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.339 
those are pretty solid on there but yeah
there<00:05:36.860> you<00:05:37.069> go<00:05:37.129> hope<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.270> enjoyed<00:05:38.599> watching

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
there you go hope you enjoyed watching

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.590 
there you go hope you enjoyed watching
