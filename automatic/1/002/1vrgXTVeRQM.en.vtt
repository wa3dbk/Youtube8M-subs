over the New York Knicks and everybody

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
over the New York Knicks and everybody
knows<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> New<00:00:51.840> York<00:00:52.140> Knicks<00:00:52.199> fan<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
knows I'm a New York Knicks fan and I

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.790 
knows I'm a New York Knicks fan and I
honestly<00:00:53.190> expect<00:00:54.180> both<00:00:54.629> teams<00:00:55.079> give<00:00:55.469> or<00:00:55.620> take

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
honestly expect both teams give or take

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.299 
honestly expect both teams give or take
injury<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.059> approximately<00:00:57.930> 50<00:00:58.739> wins

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
injury to be at approximately 50 wins

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
injury to be at approximately 50 wins
and<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.570> both<00:01:00.780> basically<00:01:01.140> almost

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and I think they both basically almost

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.219 
and I think they both basically almost
have<00:01:02.100> slim<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:02.760> chance<00:01:03.030> against<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> Miami

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
have slim to no chance against the Miami

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
have slim to no chance against the Miami
Heat<00:01:04.470> I'd<00:01:04.680> probably<00:01:04.979> still<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.180> heat

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
Heat I'd probably still take the heat

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
Heat I'd probably still take the heat
out<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> Eastern<00:01:07.140> Conference<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.979> of
