that's<00:03:56.340> one<00:03:56.640> side<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.769> then<00:03:58.769> that's<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
that's one side and then that's the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.949 
that's one side and then that's the
other<00:03:59.370> side<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.730> just<00:04:00.000> tied<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.239> nice<00:04:00.600> sturdy

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.509 
knot in it so then that way it won't
fall<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.109> that's<00:04:04.650> where<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> put<00:04:05.310> my<00:04:05.459> two

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
fall and that's where I put my two

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.400 
fall and that's where I put my two
little<00:04:05.790> holes<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.600> if<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.870> put<00:04:07.079> them<00:04:07.139> close

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
little holes and if you put them close

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.410 
little holes and if you put them close
to<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.739> top<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.670> don't<00:04:08.819> have<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.150> worry<00:04:09.329> about

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
to the top you don't have to worry about

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.330 
to the top you don't have to worry about
the<00:04:09.750> screen<00:04:10.079> ripping<00:04:10.500> too<00:04:10.709> much<00:04:10.889> it'll<00:04:11.130> just

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the screen ripping too much it'll just

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.610 
the screen ripping too much it'll just
kind<00:04:11.579> of<00:04:11.670> hold<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.030> steady<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:13.049> that's<00:04:13.290> what<00:04:13.530> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
kind of hold it steady so that's what it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.440 
kind of hold it steady so that's what it
looks<00:04:13.650> like<00:04:14.040> in

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.360 

and<00:04:19.450> that's<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.019> back<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.620> it's<00:04:21.010> just<00:04:21.280> so

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
and that's the back of it it's just so

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.770 
and that's the back of it it's just so
you<00:04:21.489> can<00:04:21.670> see<00:04:21.880> how<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.090> tie<00:04:22.390> it<00:04:22.420> in<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.690> back

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
you can see how to tie it in the back

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.800 
you can see how to tie it in the back
tie<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.230> knot<00:04:23.470> on<00:04:23.710> one<00:04:23.770> side<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.670> a<00:04:25.270> knot<00:04:25.450> on<00:04:25.660> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
tie a knot on one side and a knot on the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.710 
tie a knot on one side and a knot on the
other<00:04:25.960> side<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.650> then<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.160> are<00:04:27.340> good<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.720> go

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
other side and then you are good to go

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.960 
other side and then you are good to go
so<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.290> had<00:04:29.470> gotten<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.800> few<00:04:29.950> questions<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.640> it

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
so I had gotten a few questions on it

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.670 
so I had gotten a few questions on it
when<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.390> was<00:04:31.720> doing<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.020> video<00:04:32.140> because<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.620> think

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
when I was doing a video because I think

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680 
when I was doing a video because I think
someone<00:04:33.130> saw<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.610> background<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.600> I

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
someone saw it in the background and I

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.240 
someone saw it in the background and I
just<00:04:34.720> really<00:04:35.200> wanted<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.590> show<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.830> how<00:04:36.070> it

know store it concealed somewhere but

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.320 
know store it concealed somewhere but
for<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:48.010> few<00:04:48.220> dollars<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.730> can<00:04:48.910> create<00:04:49.180> a

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
for just a few dollars you can create a

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.180 
for just a few dollars you can create a
screen<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:49.900> will<00:04:50.230> hold<00:04:50.560> all<00:04:50.950> of<00:04:50.980> your

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
screen that will hold all of your

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.570 
screen that will hold all of your
jewelry<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:52.290> it's<00:04:53.290> really<00:04:53.590> inexpensive<00:04:53.919> I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
jewelry and it's really inexpensive I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.940 
jewelry and it's really inexpensive I
think<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.390> screen<00:04:55.660> was<00:04:55.870> under<00:04:56.080> 20<00:04:56.410> bucks<00:04:56.440> and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
think the screen was under 20 bucks and

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.290 
think the screen was under 20 bucks and
the<00:04:57.040> string<00:04:57.310> was<00:04:57.490> free<00:04:57.700> because<00:04:57.790> I<00:04:58.000> had<00:04:58.150> that

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
the string was free because I had that

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.570 
the string was free because I had that
laying<00:04:58.570> around<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.800> command<00:05:00.190> hooks<00:05:00.430> I

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
laying around and the command hooks I

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.220 
laying around and the command hooks I
think<00:05:00.790> for<00:05:00.910> 2<00:05:01.060> bucks<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.540> can<00:05:01.690> find<00:05:01.930> these<00:05:02.080> at

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
think for 2 bucks you can find these at

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.659 
think for 2 bucks you can find these at
Walmart<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:02.740> I'm<00:05:02.830> really<00:05:03.130> hoping<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.460> this
