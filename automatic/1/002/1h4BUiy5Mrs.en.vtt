00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.940 
alright the overhead swing you can get
to<00:03:38.520> attack<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.210> but<00:03:39.900> since<00:03:40.560> there's<00:03:40.740> two<00:03:40.860> of

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
to attack in but since there's two of

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.400 
to attack in but since there's two of
them<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.430> won't<00:03:41.610> risk<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.300> if<00:03:42.570> there's<00:03:43.230> two

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
them you won't risk it if there's two

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.170 
them you won't risk it if there's two
sentinels<00:03:43.890> when<00:03:44.550> you're<00:03:44.670> fighting<00:03:44.790> these<00:03:45.030> two

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
sentinels when you're fighting these two

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.380 
sentinels when you're fighting these two
sentinels<00:03:45.660> together<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:47.160> want<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.120> get

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
sentinels together you want to just get

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.220 
sentinels together you want to just get
one<00:03:48.810> hit<00:03:49.050> in<00:03:49.230> right<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.940> careful<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
one hit in right and be careful if the

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.380 
one hit in right and be careful if the
other<00:03:52.380> ones<00:03:52.560> too<00:03:53.010> near<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.550> want<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.060> recommend

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
other ones too near I want to recommend

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.600 
other ones too near I want to recommend
you<00:03:54.630> getting<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.380> hit<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.740> because<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.280> might<00:03:56.460> be

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
you getting a hit in because it might be

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.450 
you getting a hit in because it might be
a<00:03:56.640> bit<00:03:56.790> risky<00:03:57.110> alright<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.290> one<00:03:58.710> to<00:03:58.980> swing

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
a bit risky alright the one to swing

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.780 
a bit risky alright the one to swing
side<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.880> side<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.600> guys<00:04:00.780> can<00:04:01.020> block<00:04:01.410> and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
side to side you guys can block and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.190 
side to side you guys can block and
backward<00:04:02.790> dodge<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.210> they<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.630> recovery

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
backward dodge that they have a recovery

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.920 
backward dodge that they have a recovery
time<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:05.300> like<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.390> said<00:04:06.570> before<00:04:06.660> they

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
time for that like I said before they

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.120 
time for that like I said before they
have<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> recovery<00:04:07.470> time<00:04:07.650> for<00:04:07.770> all<00:04:07.950> their

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
have a recovery time for all their

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.190 
have a recovery time for all their
attacks<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.640> spinning<00:04:09.390> move<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.990> block<00:04:10.170> it

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
attacks a spinning move just block it

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.610 
attacks a spinning move just block it
easy<00:04:10.650> no<00:04:11.160> problem

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
easy no problem

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.949 
easy no problem
make<00:04:13.620> make<00:04:14.310> sure<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.760> keep<00:04:15.180> an<00:04:15.360> eye<00:04:15.510> on<00:04:15.540> two

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
make make sure you keep an eye on two

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.590 
make make sure you keep an eye on two
together<00:04:16.560> alright<00:04:17.070> if<00:04:17.340> they<00:04:17.549> jump<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.359> that

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
together alright if they jump like that

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.780 
together alright if they jump like that
they<00:04:19.560> split<00:04:19.979> up<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:21.180> want<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:22.310> try<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.400> get

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
they split up you want to try to get

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.570 
they split up you want to try to get
around<00:04:24.030> them<00:04:24.210> just

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
around them just

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.640 
around them just
make<00:04:24.789> them<00:04:24.970> stick<00:04:25.629> together<00:04:25.750> again<00:04:26.199> so<00:04:26.500> it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
make them stick together again so it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.529 
make them stick together again so it
will<00:04:26.800> make<00:04:26.889> your<00:04:27.009> fight<00:04:27.250> easier<00:04:27.580> if<00:04:28.180> they're

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
will make your fight easier if they're

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.050 
will make your fight easier if they're
if<00:04:29.169> ones<00:04:29.470> on<00:04:29.650> opposite<00:04:30.310> sides<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.669> each<00:04:30.849> other

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
if ones on opposite sides of each other

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.550 
if ones on opposite sides of each other
then<00:04:31.419> it's<00:04:31.750> going<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.960> be<00:04:32.050> hard<00:04:32.259> for<00:04:32.319> you<00:04:32.530> to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
then it's going to be hard for you to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.580 
then it's going to be hard for you to
keep<00:04:33.099> track<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.460> who<00:04:33.610> who's<00:04:34.479> who<00:04:34.689> because<00:04:35.050> if

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
keep track of who who's who because if

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.260 
keep track of who who's who because if
you<00:04:35.710> attack<00:04:35.979> one<00:04:36.189> the<00:04:36.460> other<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.969> other<00:04:37.120> one

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you attack one the other the other one

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.490 
you attack one the other the other one
might<00:04:37.449> be<00:04:37.599> like<00:04:37.840> doing<00:04:38.110> some<00:04:38.289> sort<00:04:38.379> of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
might be like doing some sort of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.899 
might be like doing some sort of
devastating<00:04:38.740> attack<00:04:39.189> behind<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.819> you

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
devastating attack behind you and you

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.969 
devastating attack behind you and you
won't<00:04:40.000> be<00:04:40.150> able<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.389> see<00:04:40.539> so<00:04:41.349> you<00:04:41.409> want<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.860> keep

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
won't be able to see so you want to keep

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.860 
won't be able to see so you want to keep
an<00:04:42.159> eye<00:04:42.280> on<00:04:42.310> both<00:04:42.909> of<00:04:42.969> them<00:04:43.270> all<00:04:43.360> right<00:04:43.479> make

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
an eye on both of them all right make

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.559 
an eye on both of them all right make
sure<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.229> don't<00:04:44.319> lose<00:04:44.500> track<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.860> them<00:04:45.270> if<00:04:46.270> one

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
sure you don't lose track of them if one

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.510
