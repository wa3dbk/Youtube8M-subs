simulated skydiving and it really is an

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110 
simulated skydiving and it really is an
amazing<00:00:52.530> experience<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.940> for

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
amazing experience and it is really for

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
amazing experience and it is really for
people<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.600> ages<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.620> much<00:00:55.770> fun

which<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.250> room<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> we've<00:01:02.640> created<00:01:02.969> in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
which is the room that we've created in

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.950 
which is the room that we've created in
the<00:01:03.420> aft<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> ship<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.960> tremendous

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the aft of the ship it's a tremendous

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
the aft of the ship it's a tremendous
room<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.750> 270<00:01:09.750> degree<00:01:10.260> panoramic<00:01:10.920> views

room you have 270 degree panoramic views
of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.460> ocean<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> during<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> day<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of the ocean so during the day it is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
of the ocean so during the day it is
just<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.490> wonderful<00:01:14.909> place<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> go

and<00:01:56.100> said<00:01:56.549> wow<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.270> feel<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.439> stateroom

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and said wow I feel like this stateroom

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
and said wow I feel like this stateroom
is<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> make<00:01:59.880> me<00:01:59.909> feel<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.540> at

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
