 hello readers of the hotel was already here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 blog all online space dotcom 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.190
 bringing another technology tutorial 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 for you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.840
 today you will learn to remove programs 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.449
 windows 2000 startup 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 8.1 on windows 8 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 good it is very simple and that this tutorial 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.090
 so we go quickly here 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.369
 first thing we have to do 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.759
 which is to access the task manager 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.800
 here to process the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.880
 windows tasks there are several 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 ways you can for example 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.030
 to press windows is to reissue the task 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.969
 mg and press enter or you can 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 click on the taskbar here and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 access the task manager or you 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.739
 still may what I think more 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.860
 simple use shortcut keys 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 against the shift is here and access to the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.530
 manager here task on manager 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 task and comes in the boot tab and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.140
 aquino on the tab in the status column you have 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 that all the programs that are 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.729
 currently booting with your windows 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 here are those programs that do not 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.920
 realize with windows they consume 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.659
 computer resources at a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 system boot so it 's good 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.860
 you always leave this at a minimum 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.320
 possible only the programs that you 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 use is to disable 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 any program that marks it and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.119
 Click Disable Enable 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.880
 again click on it and click enable 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.979
 they will do it there the next time 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.290
 you restart the computer programs 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.119
 You disabled did not go any more. 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.619
 boot with the system and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.720
 probably your system will 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.790
 boot a little faster and you 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.070
 will have a little more resources to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.409
 always use remembering and then you 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 remove startup programs it 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.280
 it will only be accessible to you when 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 you access it here 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.869
 ie it is not going to be present 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.430
 here in the system tray 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.500
 good staff so this is hopefully 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.540
