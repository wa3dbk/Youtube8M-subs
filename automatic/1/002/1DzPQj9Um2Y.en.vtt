your a point thumb the controls aren't
bad<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:09.940> they're<00:03:10.389> pretty<00:03:10.540> floaty<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.049> this

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
bad but they're pretty floaty and this

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.170 
bad but they're pretty floaty and this
kind<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.650> adds<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.160> challenge<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.970> takes

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
kind of adds to the challenge it takes

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.520 
kind of adds to the challenge it takes
time<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.450> slow<00:03:13.750> down<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:13.989> change<00:03:14.380> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
time to slow down and change the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.960 
time to slow down and change the
direction<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.980> your<00:03:15.130> jump<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.519> you'll<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.819> to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
direction of your jump so you'll have to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.370 
direction of your jump so you'll have to
be<00:03:16.060> thinking<00:03:16.389> ahead<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.720> while<00:03:16.900> making<00:03:17.109> your

be thinking ahead and while making your

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.750 
be thinking ahead and while making your
way<00:03:17.470> forward<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:17.950> avoiding<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> traps<00:03:18.639> and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
way forward and avoiding the traps and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.729 
way forward and avoiding the traps and
pitfalls<00:03:18.910> it'd<00:03:19.660> be<00:03:19.780> too<00:03:19.959> simple<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.620> go

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
pitfalls it'd be too simple to just go

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.020 
pitfalls it'd be too simple to just go
from<00:03:20.920> one<00:03:20.980> end<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.459> stage<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.000> other
