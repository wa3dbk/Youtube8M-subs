00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
if you leave asked how I work my

if you leave asked how I work my
turntables<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:21.590> Virtual<00:00:22.590> DJ<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:23.640> pretty

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
turntables with Virtual DJ that's pretty

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420 
turntables with Virtual DJ that's pretty
simple<00:00:24.269> way<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.930> myself<00:00:25.310> first<00:00:26.310> of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
simple way you can see myself first of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.500 
simple way you can see myself first of
all<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.609> look<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> N<00:00:27.480> on

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
all this look we have we have the N on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.050 
all this look we have we have the N on
MC<00:00:27.900> 6000<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.099> except<00:00:29.490> timecode<00:00:29.880> in

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
MC 6000 that is not except timecode in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
MC 6000 that is not except timecode in
so<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.779> using<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> m-audio<00:00:31.710> connective<00:00:32.550> card

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so I'm using the m-audio connective card

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.450 
so I'm using the m-audio connective card
which<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.449> part<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> torque<00:00:34.440> package<00:00:34.920> but

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
which is part of the torque package but

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.789 
which is part of the torque package but
basically<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> turntables<00:00:37.140> hooked

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:37.799 
basically I have the turntables hooked

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.340 
basically I have the turntables hooked
up<00:00:37.979> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> UM<00:00:38.400> audio<00:00:38.729> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> UM<00:00:39.960> audio

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
up to the UM audio and then the UM audio

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.610 
up to the UM audio and then the UM audio
connected<00:00:40.979> to<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.760> den<00:00:42.479> on<00:00:42.659> I<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.470> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
connected to the den on I use the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
connected to the den on I use the
m-audio<00:00:43.949> as<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.760> sound<00:00:44.970> card<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.199> mean<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
m-audio as the sound card so I mean this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.280 
m-audio as the sound card so I mean this
is<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.159> know<00:00:47.250> using<00:00:47.460> sarado<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
is just like you know using sarado you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.640 
is just like you know using sarado you
put<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.350> record<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:50.059> go<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> configuration<00:00:51.780> we

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
put the record on go to configuration we

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.270 
put the record on go to configuration we
have<00:00:52.769> a<00:00:52.799> going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:54.530> connective<00:00:55.530> audio<00:00:56.010> right

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
have a going to connective audio right

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.090 
have a going to connective audio right
there<00:00:56.610> let's<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.089> of<00:00:57.500> zoom<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.619> focus<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there let's kind of zoom in focus on

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.799 
there let's kind of zoom in focus on
that<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.430> bit<00:00:59.699> you'll<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.720> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that a little bit you'll see where is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.719 
that a little bit you'll see where is
this<00:01:00.900> connective<00:01:01.379> audio<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.369> go<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> town

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
this connective audio then we go to town

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.899 
this connective audio then we go to town
code<00:01:02.970> configuration<00:01:03.900> and<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.549> sarado

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
code configuration and just like sarado

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.210 
code configuration and just like sarado
I<00:01:06.030> mean<00:01:06.180> that's<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.750> pretty<00:01:07.710> simple

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.470 

using<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> performance<00:01:11.610> vinyl<00:01:12.120> my<00:01:12.270> gain

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
using the performance vinyl my gain

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.700 
using the performance vinyl my gain
doesn't<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.050> very<00:01:13.290> high<00:01:13.470> otherwise

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
doesn't have to be very high otherwise

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.340 
doesn't have to be very high otherwise
it's<00:01:14.040> usually<00:01:14.220> around<00:01:14.430> 12<00:01:14.670> o'clock<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it's usually around 12 o'clock and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's usually around 12 o'clock and
you'll<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.070> well<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.910> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you'll see how well or how good the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
you'll see how well or how good the
performance<00:01:18.180> vinyl<00:01:18.660> is<00:01:18.780> done<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> perfect

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
performance vinyl is done was a perfect

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.550 
performance vinyl is done was a perfect
circle<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:20.520> zero<00:01:20.880> adjustments<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
circle with zero adjustments the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.900 
circle with zero adjustments the
important<00:01:22.950> question<00:01:23.280> how<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:23.580> does<00:01:23.730> it

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
important question how well does it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.810 
important question how well does it
perform<00:01:24.950> also<00:01:25.950> auto<00:01:26.100> still<00:01:26.430> has<00:01:26.580> better

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
perform also auto still has better

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.750 
perform also auto still has better
tracking<00:01:27.320> virtual<00:01:28.320> DJs<00:01:28.680> working<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> improve

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
tracking virtual DJs working to improve

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.920 
tracking virtual DJs working to improve
that<00:01:29.970> on

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that on

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.760 
that on
from<00:01:31.140> where<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> understand<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:36.470> think<00:01:37.470> that's

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
from where I understand I think that's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.720 
from where I understand I think that's
that's<00:01:38.280> pretty<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:40.230> know<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:41.040> slowly

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
that's pretty good you know it slowly

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:52.490 
that's pretty good you know it slowly
tracks<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:47.360> just<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> give<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.660> an<00:01:48.750> idea<00:01:51.500> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
tracks it just to give you an idea you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.480 
tracks it just to give you an idea you
take<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.890> way<00:01:52.980> back<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:56.130> tracks<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
take it all the way back so it tracks it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.450 
take it all the way back so it tracks it
pretty<00:01:56.670> well<00:02:00.830> that's<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.890> pretty<00:02:02.100> good<00:02:02.250> job

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
pretty well that's a pretty good job

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
pretty well that's a pretty good job
where<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.330> get<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:03.690> know<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:04.080> tricky

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
where I can get you know really tricky

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440 
where I can get you know really tricky
is<00:02:04.650> if<00:02:05.460> you're<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.910> be<00:02:06.030> trying<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.330> going

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
is if you're going to be trying to going

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
is if you're going to be trying to going
back<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.780> forth<00:02:06.960> quickly<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.410> no<00:02:08.119> just

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
back and forth quickly like that no just

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.300 
back and forth quickly like that no just
so<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.390> hear<00:02:09.570> real<00:02:09.810> quick

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.390 

it<00:02:14.970> keeps<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> pretty<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:15.720> however<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.980> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
it keeps it pretty well however if you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.610 
it keeps it pretty well however if you
don't<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.970> calibrated<00:02:18.630> properly<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
don't have this calibrated properly you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.870 
don't have this calibrated properly you
know<00:02:19.739> me<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.220> those<00:02:20.280> things<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.730> a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
know me it's one of those things that a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.729 
know me it's one of those things that a
lot<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.270> times<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> couple<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.200> skips<00:02:22.530> and

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
