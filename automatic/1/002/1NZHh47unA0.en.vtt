a little bit about his CRT rides for
both<00:00:17.220> MotoGP<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.180> indy<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.020> laguna<00:00:19.580> that's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
both MotoGP in indy and laguna that's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.840 
both MotoGP in indy and laguna that's
correct<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:21.030> we<00:00:21.570> put<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> wild<00:00:22.320> card<00:00:22.560> for

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
correct we we put in for a wild card for

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.360 
correct we we put in for a wild card for
laguna<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.030> indianapolis<00:00:25.020> and<00:00:25.230> ear<00:00:26.130> too<00:00:26.340> and

the<00:00:26.700> FIM<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> Dorna<00:00:27.570> they<00:00:27.720> approved<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.440> so

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the FIM and Dorna they approved it so

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
the FIM and Dorna they approved it so
now<00:00:29.220> we're<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.520> midst<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.820> building<00:00:30.390> our

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
now we're in the midst of building our

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.479 
now we're in the midst of building our
machine<00:00:30.750> what's<00:00:31.440> it<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.710> building<00:00:32.129> a<00:00:32.189> CRT

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
machine what's it like building a CRT

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.970 
machine what's it like building a CRT
machine<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.180> lot<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> engineering<00:00:34.079> time<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
machine a lot of engineering time and we

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.560 
machine a lot of engineering time and we
have<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.129> full<00:00:35.370> facility<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:36.059> our<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.420> our

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
have a full facility at our at our

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
have a full facility at our at our
headquarters<00:00:37.289> in<00:00:37.710> Huntington<00:00:38.219> Beach

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
headquarters in Huntington Beach

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.610 
headquarters in Huntington Beach
California<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.000> we're<00:00:39.990> capable<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.410> building

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
California so we're capable of building

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
California so we're capable of building
the<00:00:40.829> machines<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.340> used<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.820> swing<00:00:42.060> arms<00:00:42.270> in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the machines we used to do swing arms in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000 
the machines we used to do swing arms in
the<00:00:42.420> past<00:00:42.630> and<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:42.990> since<00:00:43.230> I've<00:00:43.560> gone<00:00:43.740> to<00:00:43.890> other

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the past and we since I've gone to other

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.560 
the past and we since I've gone to other
billet<00:00:44.340> products<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.850> triple<00:00:45.060> clamps<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
billet products like a triple clamps and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.240 
billet products like a triple clamps and
rear<00:00:45.720> sets<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.410> those<00:00:46.590> things<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.040> just

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
rear sets and those things this is just

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.410 
rear sets and those things this is just
a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.550> bigger<00:00:47.700> project<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.300> it's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
a little bit bigger project but it's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.120 
a little bit bigger project but it's
basically<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.810> same<00:00:48.870> same<00:00:49.829> type<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
basically the same same type of

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.920 
basically the same same type of
engineering<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:50.970> goes<00:00:51.060> behind<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.660> there's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
engineering that goes behind it there's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
engineering that goes behind it there's
obviously<00:00:52.380> some<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:52.920> complicated<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
obviously some more complicated with a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
obviously some more complicated with a
building<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> chassis<00:00:54.450> as<00:00:54.840> far<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
building a chassis as far as the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.660 
building a chassis as far as the
rigidity<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.950> flex<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> things<00:00:56.579> like

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
rigidity and the flex and things like

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
rigidity and the flex and things like
that<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.060> those<00:00:57.630> are<00:00:57.780> things<00:00:57.899> were<00:00:58.079> fairly

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that but those are things were fairly

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
that but those are things were fairly
familiar<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.950> Dorna<00:00:59.790> and<00:00:59.970> FIM<00:01:00.390> created<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
familiar with Dorna and FIM created the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290 
familiar with Dorna and FIM created the
CRT<00:01:01.530> team<00:01:01.770> claiming<00:01:02.190> rules<00:01:02.430> team<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:03.059> motogp

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
CRT team claiming rules team for motogp

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
CRT team claiming rules team for motogp
this<00:01:03.750> season<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> try<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.680> writers

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this season to try and get more writers

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.830 
this season to try and get more writers
on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> grid<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.509> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
on the grid what do you think about that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
on the grid what do you think about that
I<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.009> it's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.399> fairly<00:01:08.610> good<00:01:08.790> idea

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
I think it's it's a fairly good idea

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.149 
I think it's it's a fairly good idea
because<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> grid<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:09.899> shrinking<00:01:10.439> when

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
because the grid was shrinking when

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.430 
because the grid was shrinking when
Kawasaki<00:01:11.700> pulled<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.290> other

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
Kawasaki pulled out and the other

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.600 
Kawasaki pulled out and the other
manufacturer<00:01:13.920> thing<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.130> struggling<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
manufacturer thing is struggling a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.980 
manufacturer thing is struggling a
little<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> maintain<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> size<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
little bit to maintain the size of the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
little bit to maintain the size of the
grid<00:01:16.140> were<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.130> support<00:01:17.460> teams<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.180> i

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
grid were there support teams and so i

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 
grid were there support teams and so i
think<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.960> good<00:01:19.080> plan<00:01:19.260> i'm<00:01:19.590> not

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
think it's a it's a good plan i'm not

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.750 
think it's a it's a good plan i'm not
sure<00:01:20.010> if<00:01:20.130> they're<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.490> hundred

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
sure if they're going to go hundred

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.270 
sure if they're going to go hundred
percent<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.180> everyone<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.720> CRT<00:01:22.049> bikes<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:23.250> i

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
percent with everyone on CRT bikes but i

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
percent with everyone on CRT bikes but i
think<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:23.700> opportunity<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.270> company

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
think it's an opportunity for a company

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
think it's an opportunity for a company
like<00:01:24.869> ours<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:26.549> opened<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> whole

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
like ours it's it opened up a whole

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640 
like ours it's it opened up a whole
array<00:01:27.510> of<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.530> do

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
array of things that we can do

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
array of things that we can do
personally<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.119> jump<00:01:30.330> right<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
personally so we just jump right on it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960 
personally so we just jump right on it
so<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> ask<00:01:31.650> steve<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.490> aboard<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so we have to ask steve was aboard the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.660 
so we have to ask steve was aboard the
black<00:01:33.930> ops<00:01:34.260> bike<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.830> Daytona<00:01:35.250> now<00:01:35.490> he's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
black ops bike in Daytona now he's
