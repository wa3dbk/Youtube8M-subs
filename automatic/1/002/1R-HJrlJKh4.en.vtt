00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.029
 step by step 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.079
 that if I messi that in a year and not very high in the Chaco 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.429
 because the houses more 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.820
 very bad 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 good but you must have a lawyer not 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.169
 I wanted to assume 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.109
 just what you need to save is to reserve a part of our income 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.439
 to be able to use it in the future 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.100
 even I do not think your opponents 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.190
 if not saving is something positive and very simple 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.660
 if we save a little of what we earn for the future we can improve 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.270
 our quality of life 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.340
 think you would have settled in one year 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.290
 well, it turns out that like everything in my course of finance for all 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.290
 We are no longer bankrupt and now Jorge Nuno Reis 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.280
 and what are you going to do with it? 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.289
 I'm going to buy insurance for my family 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.300
 denied today on vacation to Laredo where I want to buy me angels 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.420
 machinery jahic tecpa their quesadillas and for me 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.830
 a computer 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.780
 in one of those was putting a cybercafÃ© or whatever they call it as the law 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.310
 very well do not revilla not get caught and all thanks to savings 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.540
 and you will be hard to save 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.829
 my dream 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.900
 although saving is a positive reality and easy to achieve 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 if you say so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.869
 if we regularly keep a little bit of what we earn for the future we can 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.000
 plan and important winds 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 the operation that we need the studies of our children our 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.090
 actions losses and even the biggest dreams 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.880
 or to you who would like 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 what I would like 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.160
 i adn 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.250
 right away the merit that is going to be without work in a year 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 Well, you have time to save for that moment 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 saving is saving a little bit of what we have for the future 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.190
 and the good thing is that here in finance for all we are going to learn how 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.789
 people
