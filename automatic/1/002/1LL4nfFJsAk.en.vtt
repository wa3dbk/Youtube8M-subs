00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 being in mama ti i went to vinci center 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.990
 where under the roof teach the basics 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.900

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.480
 stands comes down and stops 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.800
 the position of the pressure on the ankle 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.240
 ah equally hands are in front 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 knees and ankles and hips all 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.369
 is in a soft position and you see 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 that you are in position 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.000
 enchanted because you see traces 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.260
 on the carpet 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.050
 here in the same position now 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 the carpet will begin to move quietly here 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 look he is already starting to move you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 find in the same position and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 go down you can not go down endlessly 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 a little more yes yes pressure at 1 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 on skis and you start to turn 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.450
 when pressure increases on the right 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 leg you turn left when on 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.890
 your left leg you turn right for 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 order to increase more pressure on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.079
 one ski just needs a little bit 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.120
 bend your knee more 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.620
 balancing goes to the bottom you and here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 now you see christie 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.729
 when after you cross 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 slope line you start to go 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.369
 parallel 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.530
 and here after you are a little bit more 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.140
 more increase and balance on the bottom you 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.600
 do you start driving just check 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.090
 see how well you are doing here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 arms shoulders and chest all look to the side 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 valleys 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.049
 hands work in sync stick stick 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 happens due to what works 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.610
 brush but by no means the whole hand and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.880
 here is a man again shows how 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.250
 way all this happens here is pressure 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.030
 more by 1 higher in the valley more by 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.939
 the other you do 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.610
 and when you go a longer turn 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.670
 the hull is looking towards the movement of the skis 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.500
 but as soon as you start these short 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.130
 tight like a man now 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.409
 shows 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.329
 arms shoulders and chest look to the side 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.680
 valleys 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.869
 puppet stick comes at the expense of work 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.700
 brushes and everything works out very well 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.170
 bodies work relatively still 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 only lower body 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.239
 legs knees ankle and here it is 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.290
 the main thing is always the pressure of some kind 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.930
 show more often 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.629
 pressure on the bottom you same ballast bottom 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.170
 skiing is the basis of skiing 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.599
 technology 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.590
 no matter how good you are 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.069
 balancing on the bottom you are so 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.780
 ok you will ski and in 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.079
 I love in any snow conditions any 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.390
 snowy on any ski slope on 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.930
 Look anymore 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.329
 long turn 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.069
 a short twist and i think thats 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.530
 this time that you watch this short 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.680
 roller you will see the difference in direction 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.560
 looking and you can say so 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.319
 Corps, you see when a person goes 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.430
 short turn then his body looks 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.709
 toward the valley 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.150
 I wish you all the best in 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.150
 mastering ski equipment
