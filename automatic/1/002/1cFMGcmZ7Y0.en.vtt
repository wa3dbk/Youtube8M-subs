scales really down in all the positions
one<00:00:33.180> thing<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.930> lot<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> guitar<00:00:34.620> players

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
one thing that a lot of guitar players

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
one thing that a lot of guitar players
are<00:00:35.790> dogged<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.160> could<00:00:38.309> be

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
dogged with something is you get into

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.790 
dogged with something is you get into
just<00:00:42.420> playing<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> same<00:00:43.050> old<00:00:43.079> riffs<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.680> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
just playing the same old riffs and you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
just playing the same old riffs and you
let<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.070> fingers<00:00:44.280> sort<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.910> take<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> lead

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
let your fingers sort of take the lead

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
let your fingers sort of take the lead
and<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.219> frustrating<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> lot

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and it can be very frustrating for a lot

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
and it can be very frustrating for a lot
of<00:00:48.480> players<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.079> say<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.500> don't

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of players because they say well I don't

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110 
of players because they say well I don't
know<00:00:49.770> how<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> break<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.940> what

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
know how to break out of you know what

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.790 
know how to break out of you know what
I've<00:00:51.239> been<00:00:51.360> doing<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> play

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I've been doing and want to play

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
I've been doing and want to play
something<00:00:53.039> more<00:00:53.309> interesting<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.149> great<00:00:54.809> way

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
something more interesting a great way

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.270 
something more interesting a great way
to<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.739> an<00:00:55.860> automatic<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
to do that in an automatic way is to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
to do that in an automatic way is to
take<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> particular<00:00:59.670> scale<00:01:00.210> play<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
take a particular scale play it in a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.600 
take a particular scale play it in a
position<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.180> patterns<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.580> same

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
position and then play patterns the same

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.090 
position and then play patterns the same
type<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> patterns<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> same<00:01:07.080> type<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> finger

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
type of patterns the same type of finger

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
type of patterns the same type of finger
movement<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> different<00:01:09.240> areas<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> board

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
movement in different areas of the board

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
movement in different areas of the board
so<00:01:10.860> you're<00:01:10.979> thinking<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:12.020> just

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so you're thinking more about just

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440 
so you're thinking more about just
navigating<00:01:13.799> through<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> scale<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
navigating through the scale in that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.499 
navigating through the scale in that
area<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> fretboard<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.250> less<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:18.270> all

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
area of the fretboard and less about all

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.210 
area of the fretboard and less about all
I'm<00:01:18.780> playing<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> lick<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> learned<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I'm playing a lick that I learned or a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.020 
I'm playing a lick that I learned or a
lick<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.759> know

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
lick that I know

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
lick that I know
in<00:01:21.330> fact<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> stop<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.500> about<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
in fact you stop think about that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.820 
in fact you stop think about that
entirely<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:25.140> should<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.799> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
entirely and you we should do is just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.280 
entirely and you we should do is just
listen<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.759> you're<00:01:26.909> playing<00:01:27.290> while

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
listen to what you're playing while

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
listen to what you're playing while
being<00:01:28.590> aware<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> well<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.610> notes<00:01:29.880> are

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
being aware of well what notes are

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
being aware of well what notes are
available<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.770> scale

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
available to me that are in that scale

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
available to me that are in that scale
in<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.790> part<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> neck<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.290> let<00:01:34.439> me

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
in that part of the neck so let me

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.370 
in that part of the neck so let me
demonstrate<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.430> right<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:36.380> let's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
demonstrate that to you right now let's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.140 
demonstrate that to you right now let's
first<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.920> through<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.369> scale<00:01:38.579> positions

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
first go through some scale positions

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
first go through some scale positions
for<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.540> major<00:01:39.869> pentatonic<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> down<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
for a major pentatonic so down here in

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.389 
for a major pentatonic so down here in
first<00:01:44.579> position<00:01:44.780> using<00:01:45.780> open<00:01:46.229> strings<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
first position using open strings this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.160 
first position using open strings this
is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> scale<00:01:48.090> pattern<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.990> major

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
is a scale pattern for a major

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:01.599 
is a scale pattern for a major
pentatonic<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> lot

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.160 

so<00:02:02.609> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.119> I'm<00:02:03.299> using<00:02:03.329> an<00:02:03.659> open<00:02:03.960> high<00:02:04.140> e

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so you can see I'm using an open high e

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.459 
so you can see I'm using an open high e
the<00:02:04.740> open<00:02:05.159> B<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.509> open<00:02:06.810> low<00:02:07.020> E

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the open B and the open low E

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.440 
the open B and the open low E
you<00:02:08.129> could<00:02:08.280> also<00:02:08.459> fret<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.330> these

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you could also fret this with these

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.539 
you could also fret this with these
fingers<00:02:15.319> which<00:02:16.319> isn't<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.739> bad<00:02:16.920> idea

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
fingers which isn't a bad idea

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.470 
fingers which isn't a bad idea
so<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.849> can<00:02:18.299> keep<00:02:18.540> yourself<00:02:19.879> in<00:02:20.879> position

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so you can keep yourself in position

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.330
