00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.200
 and the education department is close to reaching the limit for 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.610
 hiring temporary teachers and in schools still has

 but of course she is also an actress has not had history class this year at 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:18.429
 all three classes of the 1st and 2nd year of the middle school in the range we are 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:19.369
 no protection 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.529
 the school says that now you have a substitute we will start doing 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.550
 a parent sector 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.669
 Whoever is the account of this will not have 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.699
 knowledge is to take the test 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.409
 I can not understand 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 however they continue to want to be called and have no 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.650
 I do not have it, I love you. 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.079
 the public network needs two thousand teachers 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 At the same time, four thousand bankers are expected to be called but the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 continuing education in the form of temporary contracts are already 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.390
 six thousand this year close to the permitted limit of six thousand and five hundred 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.720
 hirings 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.170
 besides the budget also rita the summons of the contestants 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.719
 this year all 400 have already been hired an exit would be to send a 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.740
 proposal to change the law to the legislative chamber but the secretary 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 claimed that the relocation of resources has not entered depends on the 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.079
 taxes that is assessed every four months of government in practice has already 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.640
 proven temporary teachers do not agree on all kinds of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.550
 license 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 the director of the high school of the range of short periods is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.720
 almost impossible its substitute is difficult even for companies 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.969
 hire each year 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.429
 If life is available, there is this school two days for three more days. 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.920
 other 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.670
 Who knows, we can not stay. 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 completely harmed 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.580
 and I ended up getting why not create a database of resumes 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.130
 the sample would replace the needs as proposed by the public ministry 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.630
 we do not have the figure of the substitute 'teacher' 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.610
 exists in other states 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.760
 but we have not yet done a study an evaluation 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.479
 in the possibility of terms is rest despite 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.760
 this is our situation for the promoter 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.670
 the area of ​​education, the large number of temporary workers does not ask for continuity 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.500
 with qualified teachers for each function, for example 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.030
 special students this would support this continuous training 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.120
 for people who have added the pastor of professions through 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 because they will stay in their entire lives 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.349
 one more school in the range this high school sector west sector 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.949
 the problem repeats itself 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:42.370
 we do not deal with a press law two weeks from the end of the year 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.409
 three years but who wants to lose weight 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.560
 I know you have been training in more and more
