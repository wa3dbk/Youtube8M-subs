00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
impact on a special tool that is

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.570 
impact on a special tool that is
required<00:00:13.449> to<00:00:13.570> remove<00:00:13.900> the<00:00:14.080> shifter<00:00:14.410> seal<00:00:14.680> all

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
required to remove the shifter seal all

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.710 
required to remove the shifter seal all
the<00:00:15.610> strip<00:00:15.879> sort<00:00:16.119> of<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.270> ship<00:00:16.420> your<00:00:16.570> cell

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
the strip sort of the ship your cell

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.310 
the strip sort of the ship your cell
carrier<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.910> drops<00:00:19.119> down<00:00:19.330> in<00:00:19.510> place<00:00:19.779> and<00:00:20.140> I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
carrier just drops down in place and I

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.900 
carrier just drops down in place and I
using<00:00:20.590> this<00:00:20.650> pack<00:00:20.919> to<00:00:20.949> do<00:00:21.250> this<00:00:21.400> so<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:21.609> I<00:00:21.730> can

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
using this pack to do this so that I can

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.529 
using this pack to do this so that I can
push<00:00:22.119> down<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:23.019> keep<00:00:23.259> pressure<00:00:23.560> on<00:00:23.740> it<00:00:24.539> so

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
push down and keep pressure on it so

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.550 
push down and keep pressure on it so
that<00:00:25.689> it<00:00:25.779> doesn't<00:00:25.900> pop<00:00:26.140> up<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.650> wound<00:00:26.830> carrier

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.290 

now<00:00:32.560> what<00:00:32.800> you'll<00:00:32.950> want<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.220> do<00:00:33.370> or<00:00:33.760> try<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.030> do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
now what you'll want to do or try to do

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.140 
now what you'll want to do or try to do
is<00:00:34.570> keep<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.960> shift<00:00:35.200> shaft<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:36.610> in<00:00:36.910> place

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
is keep the shift shaft down in place

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.720 
is keep the shift shaft down in place
the<00:00:37.420> whole<00:00:37.570> time<00:00:37.840> because<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.490> shift

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
the whole time because if the shift

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.320 
the whole time because if the shift
shaft

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
shaft

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.180 
shaft
pop<00:00:40.510> so<00:00:40.810> sometimes<00:00:41.350> what'll<00:00:41.650> happen<00:00:41.890> is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
pop so sometimes what'll happen is

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.620 
pop so sometimes what'll happen is
you'll<00:00:42.220> have<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.550> take<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.850> gearcase<00:00:43.060> apart

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
you'll have to take the gearcase apart

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.200 
you'll have to take the gearcase apart
to<00:00:44.290> realign<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.890> with<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.370> cam<00:00:45.610> down<00:00:45.970> on<00:00:46.120> the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
to realign it with the cam down on the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:01:15.940 
to realign it with the cam down on the
bottom

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.440 

ah

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.450 

again<00:01:19.290> keeping<00:01:19.619> pressure<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> make

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
again keeping pressure on it to make

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.380 
again keeping pressure on it to make
sure<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> stays<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:24.049> come<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.200> closer

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
sure that stays now come a little closer

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
sure that stays now come a little closer
so<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.259> got<00:01:28.409> slots<00:01:28.830> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so you can see that it's got slots on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580 
so you can see that it's got slots on
either<00:01:29.340> side<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.810> tool<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
either side and the tool that I use to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.969 
either side and the tool that I use to
take<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.070> has<00:01:32.340> opposing<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
take it off has opposing so that it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
take it off has opposing so that it
drops<00:01:35.220> inside<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.940> is<00:01:36.630> able<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.409> spin<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.830> out

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
drops inside and is able to spin it out

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.070 
drops inside and is able to spin it out
for<00:01:38.190> me<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.850> I'll<00:01:38.940> go<00:01:39.060> ahead<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.960> some

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
for me so I'll go ahead and get some

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.539 
for me so I'll go ahead and get some
parts<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.789> put<00:01:41.789> this<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:41.970> back<00:01:42.240> together

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
parts and put this thing back together

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.740 
parts and put this thing back together
okay<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:44.909> I've<00:01:45.000> done<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> I've<00:01:45.390> taken<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
okay so what I've done is I've taken the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.950 
okay so what I've done is I've taken the
gearcase<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> I've<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.689> ship<00:01:48.689> shaft

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
gearcase out and I've put the ship shaft

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.859 
gearcase out and I've put the ship shaft
carrier<00:01:50.090> inside<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.179> vise<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.569> I'm<00:01:51.690> going<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
carrier inside the vise and I'm going to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
carrier inside the vise and I'm going to
take<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> pop<00:01:52.440> out<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.830> seal<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:59.240> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.889 
trick when we put the new one in is
we're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.959> vise<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.679> socket

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
we're going to use the vise and a socket

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.650 
we're going to use the vise and a socket
just<00:02:09.899> squeeze<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.769> place<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.390> when<00:02:12.569> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
just squeeze it in place and when you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.400 
just squeeze it in place and when you
put<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.930> back<00:02:13.019> together<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.650> spring<00:02:13.950> goes<00:02:14.220> up

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.910 
remember I mention that you put it in
reverse

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
reverse

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.180 
reverse
now<00:06:21.880> when<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.420> put<00:06:22.630> it<00:06:22.720> into<00:06:23.020> reverse<00:06:23.190> what

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
now when you put it into reverse what

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.390 
now when you put it into reverse what
this<00:06:24.370> allows<00:06:24.670> you<00:06:24.970> to<00:06:25.000> do<00:06:25.270> and<00:06:26.010> actually<00:06:27.010> I'll

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
this allows you to do and actually I'll

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.200 
this allows you to do and actually I'll
back<00:06:27.610> up<00:06:27.640> for<00:06:27.940> a<00:06:27.970> minute

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
back up for a minute

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.800 
back up for a minute
make<00:06:28.660> sure<00:06:28.840> you<00:06:28.930> put<00:06:29.140> the<00:06:29.230> shifter<00:06:30.450> in<00:06:31.450> reverse

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
make sure you put the shifter in reverse

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.360 
make sure you put the shifter in reverse
too<00:06:32.050> because<00:06:32.440> if<00:06:32.590> the<00:06:32.710> shifter<00:06:33.040> is<00:06:33.070> not<00:06:33.250> in

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
too because if the shifter is not in

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.660 
too because if the shifter is not in
reverse<00:06:33.700> you're<00:06:34.390> starting<00:06:34.750> over<00:06:35.220> so<00:06:36.220> when

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
reverse you're starting over so when

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.700 
reverse you're starting over so when
it's<00:06:36.820> in<00:06:37.030> Reverse<00:06:37.360> when<00:06:38.050> I<00:06:38.080> push<00:06:38.380> it<00:06:38.410> up<00:06:38.620> into

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
it's in Reverse when I push it up into

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.940 
it's in Reverse when I push it up into
place<00:06:38.950> now<00:06:39.280> if<00:06:39.640> I<00:06:40.120> push<00:06:40.510> down<00:06:40.770> which<00:06:41.770> is<00:06:41.920> the

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
place now if I push down which is the

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.970 
place now if I push down which is the
same<00:06:42.370> direction<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:42.990> the<00:06:43.990> prop<00:06:44.200> spins<00:06:44.620> or

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
same direction that the prop spins or

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.910 
same direction that the prop spins or
spin<00:06:45.400> it<00:06:45.520> backwards<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:46.570> rotates<00:06:47.170> the<00:06:47.620> shaft

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
spin it backwards it rotates the shaft

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.460 
spin it backwards it rotates the shaft
the<00:06:48.340> drive<00:06:48.550> shaft<00:06:48.820> the<00:06:48.970> correct<00:06:49.330> way<00:06:49.690> so<00:06:50.290> that

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
the drive shaft the correct way so that

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.459 
the drive shaft the correct way so that
I<00:06:50.500> don't<00:06:50.650> flop<00:06:51.100> the<00:06:51.280> veins<00:06:51.490> around

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:55.469 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:57.679 

oh<00:06:55.499> and<00:06:56.249> by<00:06:56.339> the<00:06:56.369> way<00:06:56.519> I<00:06:56.639> when<00:06:57.509> you<00:06:57.569> weren't

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
oh and by the way I when you weren't

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.689 
oh and by the way I when you weren't
looking<00:06:58.019> I<00:06:58.110> put<00:06:58.289> the<00:06:58.379> water<00:06:58.529> tube<00:06:58.769> in<00:06:58.919> place<00:06:59.099> it

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
looking I put the water tube in place it

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.479 
looking I put the water tube in place it
was<00:06:59.819> very<00:07:00.029> easy

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:04.489 

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:16.929 

so<00:07:05.489> line<00:07:05.819> everything<00:07:06.179> up<00:07:10.279> spin<00:07:11.279> back<00:07:11.489> and

00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:16.939 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.759 

should<00:07:17.939> go<00:07:18.119> together<00:07:18.289> jiggle<00:07:19.289> the<00:07:19.379> shifter<00:07:19.830> EP

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:21.769 
should go together jiggle the shifter EP

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:24.350 
should go together jiggle the shifter EP
if<00:07:22.769> chip<00:07:23.069> is<00:07:23.249> in<00:07:23.399> because<00:07:23.669> I<00:07:23.759> just<00:07:23.939> shifted<00:07:24.119> it

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
if chip is in because I just shifted it

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.339 
if chip is in because I just shifted it
into<00:07:24.629> neutral<00:07:24.809> and<00:07:25.489> there<00:07:26.489> we<00:07:26.639> go<00:07:27.110> now<00:07:28.110> I<00:07:28.139> want

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:28.349 
into neutral and there we go now I want

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:29.809 
into neutral and there we go now I want
to<00:07:28.409> do<00:07:28.559> is<00:07:28.709> I'll<00:07:28.860> just<00:07:28.889> put<00:07:29.279> the<00:07:29.369> nuts<00:07:29.550> in<00:07:29.669> all

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
to do is I'll just put the nuts in all

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:31.790 
to do is I'll just put the nuts in all
hall<00:07:30.149> back<00:07:30.360> on<00:07:30.629> and<00:07:30.869> we're<00:07:31.139> good<00:07:31.319> to<00:07:31.439> go

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
hall back on and we're good to go

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.919 
hall back on and we're good to go
that's<00:07:32.369> how<00:07:32.550> easy<00:07:32.610> this<00:07:33.059> is<00:07:33.119> it<00:07:33.479> should<00:07:33.689> take

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:33.929 
that's how easy this is it should take

00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:36.069 
that's how easy this is it should take
inside<00:07:34.409> a<00:07:34.439> 15<00:07:34.949> minutes<00:07:35.279> start<00:07:35.550> to<00:07:35.579> finish

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:36.079 
inside a 15 minutes start to finish
