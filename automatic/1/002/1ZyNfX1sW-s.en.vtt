00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello small today I will tell you the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.090
 history of the hen of the eggs of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.090
 today 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.730
 there was once in a very distant village a 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.040
 man who had several chickens all 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.960
 the mornings he got up very early and 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.930
 he searched among the corral nests for 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.730
 eggs that the hens had put 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.000
 one morning he discovered that one of his 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.740
 chickens had put a golden egg in 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.100
 that amazement for what he saw in his eyes 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.809
 and he ran to tell his wife 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.900
 since that day the farmer and his wife 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.410
 they collected without fail a golden egg all 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.989
 the days starting with cute cookie dipping 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.220
 bring the best corn grains or 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.220
 feed this chick 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.090
 the big Friday his wife and the hen 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.670
 of the golden eggs were very 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.010
 happy but those that were nothing 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.150
 happy were the other garages of the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.330
 corral saw the clokey hen again 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.660
 one of those eggs that give him so much 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.240
 farmer is tired that the woman of 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.760
 farmer worry more about this morning 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.760
 that she 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.890
 then I was expecting a nightfall and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.049
 making a great effort all the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.750
 chickens beat their wings and left 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.310
 flying to the neighboring farm where it 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.149
 installed with another group of chickens 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.149
 that they lived there 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.729
 when the next day dawned 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.619
 Farmer and his wife were author 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.530
 usual to collect the golden egg 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.690
 but later when they started looking 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.470
 the normal eggs were found with 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470
 a surprise 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.570
 but this is not any new use of the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.390
 chickens where the whales were played 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.190
 secure in the twill with the coyote what 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.310
 It was good that it was not convenient to extract 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.900
 hen of the eggs of things like that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.300
 it matters that we only have one chicken left 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.300
 at the end it is the most valuable and the most 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.670
 we want in addition to the golden eggs that 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.090
 we have can buy all the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.640
 chickens that we want I'm going to get wet and not 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 you think that the whole chicken inside is 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 of gold if we take them out we can be more 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.030
 rich than any other farmer of the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.610
 region 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:05.000
 we should kill her to get all the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.930
 gold that happens and we run out of air and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.930
 without golden eggs 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.030
 but the farmer did not pay attention to his 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.670
 daughter and without giving the opportunity to another 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.120
 thing like yesterday and with a huge 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.120
 knife 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.790
 and what would not be his surprise when 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.180
 discovered what the hen had 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.180
 inside 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.070
 for this chicken does not have a granite 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.070
 gold in the belly and see 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.180
 while the farmer and his wife 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.689
 they lamented their luck something happened in 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.689
 the neighboring farm 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.340
 they already found out what happened in the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.340
 farm where we lived 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.750
 I imagine that his wife 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.670
 what happened to them now 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.330
 OK 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.960
 and in a beat of wings they returned all 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.850
 the hens to their old farm when 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 they saw them the farmer and his wife arrive 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.350
 they shouted for joy and promised 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.420
 take care of them and feed them better than 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.580
 hen of the golden ways so that 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.820
 were happy and never a single 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.410
 they were abandoned and colorado colorado the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.410
 story of the parrot's hen 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.580
