00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
think to me is like the best that I've

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.580 
think to me is like the best that I've
found<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:53.370> me<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:54.000> texture<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.989> formula

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
found and to me the texture the formula

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.880 
found and to me the texture the formula
what<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.370> does<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:57.000> actually<00:03:57.690> exactly<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
what it does is actually exactly the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.640 
what it does is actually exactly the
same<00:03:59.250> as<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.820> YSL<00:04:00.300> I'm<00:04:00.930> sure<00:04:01.230> if<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.440> were<00:04:01.560> to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
same as the YSL I'm sure if I were to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.199 
same as the YSL I'm sure if I were to
break<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.980> down<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> ingredients<00:04:02.970> that

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
break it down to the ingredients that

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.640 
break it down to the ingredients that
they<00:04:03.390> would<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.170> didn't<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.470> time

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
they would and I just didn't have time

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.100 
they would and I just didn't have time
to<00:04:04.709> really<00:04:05.310> do<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:06.209> I'm<00:04:06.330> sure<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.570> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
to really do that but I'm sure that the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.960 
to really do that but I'm sure that the
ingredients<00:04:07.530> would<00:04:07.590> be<00:04:07.739> extremely<00:04:08.580> similar

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
ingredients would be extremely similar

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.650 
ingredients would be extremely similar
with<00:04:09.360> maybe<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.230> couple<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.799> like<00:04:11.010> extract

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
differences but yeah and for people with

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.270 
differences but yeah and for people with
dry<00:04:17.310> skin<00:04:18.049> or<00:04:19.049> mature<00:04:19.200> skin
