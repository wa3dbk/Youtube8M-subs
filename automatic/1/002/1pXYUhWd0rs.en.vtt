behind<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.869> lousy<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.670> he<00:00:18.790> paired<00:00:19.029> up

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
behind you and lousy and he paired up

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.260 
behind you and lousy and he paired up
with<00:00:19.270> Luke<00:00:19.480> guild<00:00:19.720> in<00:00:19.869> there<00:00:20.020> so<00:00:20.880> he<00:00:21.880> has<00:00:22.060> had

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
with Luke guild in there so he has had

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.210 
with Luke guild in there so he has had
pole<00:00:22.510> position<00:00:22.990> here<00:00:23.200> before<00:00:23.500> in<00:00:23.849> 2007<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
pole position here before in 2007 and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.950 
pole position here before in 2007 and
what<00:00:27.460> marks<00:00:27.789> doing<00:00:28.029> is<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:28.330> slightly<00:00:28.810> different

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
what marks doing is a slightly different

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.779 
what marks doing is a slightly different
approach<00:00:29.289> again<00:00:29.650> we<00:00:29.800> see<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.010> lot<00:00:30.190> more<00:00:30.220> brake

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
approach again we see a lot more brake

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.400 
approach again we see a lot more brake
throttle<00:00:31.090> aggression<00:00:31.690> than<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.900> early<00:00:32.140> part

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
throttle aggression than the early part

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.930 
throttle aggression than the early part
of<00:00:32.500> Conrad<00:00:32.890> Strait<00:00:33.190> what<00:00:33.430> he's<00:00:33.520> trying<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.820> do

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
of Conrad Strait what he's trying to do

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.490 
of Conrad Strait what he's trying to do
there<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.360> make<00:00:34.390> temperature<00:00:35.110> on<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.320> brake

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
there is make temperature on the brake

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500 
there is make temperature on the brake
rotor<00:00:35.770> which<00:00:36.340> then<00:00:36.550> radiates<00:00:36.970> into<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.330> rim

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
rotor which then radiates into the rim

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.210 
rotor which then radiates into the rim
and<00:00:37.809> then<00:00:37.960> into<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.260> tire<00:00:38.500> carcass<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.129> he's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
and then into the tire carcass and he's

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.580 
and then into the tire carcass and he's
doing<00:00:39.400> it<00:00:39.519> again<00:00:39.610> now<00:00:39.910> second<00:00:40.390> gear<00:00:40.540> on<00:00:40.900> off<00:00:41.260> on

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
doing it again now second gear on off on

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.380 
doing it again now second gear on off on
off<00:00:41.890> on<00:00:42.190> off<00:00:42.400> he's<00:00:42.640> just<00:00:42.670> alternating<00:00:43.269> the<00:00:43.360> two

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
off on off he's just alternating the two

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.130 
off on off he's just alternating the two

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
pedals down in the footwell and again

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.860 
pedals down in the footwell and again

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
what'd he do in qualifying yesterday

00:00:51.789 --> 00:01:01.340 
what'd he do in qualifying yesterday
Scofield<00:00:52.570> was<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.690> servant<00:00:53.379> before

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 

isn't<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.220> enough<00:01:02.489> grip<00:01:02.790> you<00:01:02.970> can<00:01:03.090> just

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
isn't quite enough grip you can just

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.460 
isn't quite enough grip you can just
hear<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.630> amount<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.900> throttle<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.350> he

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
hear the amount of throttle that he

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
hear the amount of throttle that he
could<00:01:04.620> get<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:04.949> car<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:06.240> he's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
could get on the car and the way he's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
could get on the car and the way he's
warming<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.229> let's<00:01:07.440> just<00:01:07.620> look<00:01:07.800> for<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
warming it up so let's just look for the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
warming it up so let's just look for the
first<00:01:08.220> two<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.490> three<00:01:08.520> corners

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
first two or three corners

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240 
first two or three corners
cuz<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.900> will<00:01:10.110> tell<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> story<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.070> mark

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
cuz this will tell the story for mark

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
cuz this will tell the story for mark

Winterbottom

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.149 
Winterbottom
so<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.549> last<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.149> Fords

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so this is the last of the Fords

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.609 
so this is the last of the Fords
to<00:01:17.729> head<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.060> inside<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> top<00:01:18.840> 10<00:01:19.109> so<00:01:19.380> blue

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
to head out inside the top 10 so blue

get pole position ride it with frosty

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120 
get pole position ride it with frosty
and<00:01:24.179> he's<00:01:24.359> a<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.749> good<00:01:24.899> qualifier<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> love

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and he's a really good qualifier I love

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.490 
and he's a really good qualifier I love
watching<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:26.640> laps<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:28.319> bit<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
watching these laps a little bit of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.580 
watching these laps a little bit of
wheelspin<00:01:28.679> out<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> turn<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.380> too

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
wheelspin out of turn one but not too

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
wheelspin out of turn one but not too
bad<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> nice<00:01:32.159> clean<00:01:32.789> exit<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
bad a nice clean exit this is so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.330 
bad a nice clean exit this is so
important<00:01:34.319> because<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.590> run<00:01:34.859> up<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> hill

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
important because this run up the hill

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.819 
important because this run up the hill
up<00:01:35.609> to<00:01:36.060> 260<00:01:36.810> kilometers<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.319> hour<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.619> so

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
up to 260 kilometers an hour is so

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.620 
up to 260 kilometers an hour is so
important<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.490> lap<00:01:38.640> time<00:01:38.849> now<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.569> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
important for the lap time now it's a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
important for the lap time now it's a
rocket<00:01:39.990> ride<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> feet<00:01:40.770> jump<00:01:41.099> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.399> middle

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
rocket ride the feet jump in the middle

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.480 
rocket ride the feet jump in the middle
and<00:01:42.020> dramatic<00:01:43.020> uphill<00:01:43.469> braking<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> allows

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and dramatic uphill braking that allows

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
and dramatic uphill braking that allows
you<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.789> really<00:01:45.299> shut<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:45.750> car<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.229> there

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you to really shut the car up there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
you to really shut the car up there
deeply<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.099> you<00:01:47.219> get<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> too<00:01:47.670> wide<00:01:47.939> you're

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
deeply but if you get it too wide you're

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
deeply but if you get it too wide you're
in<00:01:48.359> plenty<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.929> trouble<00:01:49.140> we've<00:01:49.500> seen<00:01:49.739> evidence

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
in plenty of trouble we've seen evidence

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.449 
in plenty of trouble we've seen evidence
event<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.489> weekend<00:01:51.619> there's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.679> nice<00:01:52.890> entry

event this weekend there's a nice entry

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.609 
event this weekend there's a nice entry
into<00:01:53.789> there<00:01:53.939> APA<00:01:54.750> things<00:01:55.110> probably<00:01:55.289> better

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
into there APA things probably better
