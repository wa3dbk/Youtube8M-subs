following attack it makes a ricochet

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
following attack it makes a ricochet
then<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.620> second<00:00:37.980> spell<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
then we have my second spell which is a

then we have my second spell which is a
simple<00:00:39.750> away<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.350> select<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.829> target<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
simple away you select the target on the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
simple away you select the target on the
ground<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:43.469> le<00:00:43.820> then<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.300> third<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
one is an early again but the important

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.729 
one is an early again but the important
thing<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.850> combo<00:01:00.690> field<00:01:00.930> le<00:01:01.260> or

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
thing is that it is a combo field le or

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.240 
thing is that it is a combo field le or
more<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.910> combo<00:01:03.300> field<00:01:03.769> this<00:01:04.769> le

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
more like the combo field this le

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
more like the combo field this le
produces<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.540> filled<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
produces a filled so it's you you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.870 
produces a filled so it's you you
can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> compute<00:01:12.060> part<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:13.290> four

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
can see the compute part has four

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
can see the compute part has four
seconds<00:01:14.880> duration<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.740> few

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
seconds duration you can see that in few

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.899 
seconds duration you can see that in few
duration<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:18.509> shoots<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:19.170> field<00:01:19.380> spell<00:01:19.439> is

duration and my shoots my field spell is
infiltrators<00:01:20.909> arrow<00:01:21.180> which<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.220> basically

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
infiltrators arrow which is basically

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
infiltrators arrow which is basically
you<00:01:25.110> select<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.710> target<00:01:26.490> area<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> ground

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you select a target area on the ground

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.950 
you select a target area on the ground
and<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.520> teleport<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.450> blind

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and you teleport to it and you blind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.069 
and you teleport to it and you blind
your<00:01:31.439> enemies<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.810> quite

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
your enemies around you I'm not quite

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.310 
your enemies around you I'm not quite
sure<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.950> exactly<00:01:35.310> would<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.659> utilize

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
sure how exactly would you would utilize

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.550 
sure how exactly would you would utilize
this<00:01:37.590> considering<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:40.049> short<00:01:40.320> boys

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this considering that the short boys

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.340 
this considering that the short boys
range<00:01:40.979> weapon<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.790> maybe<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.960> some

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
range weapon but maybe it has like some

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.050 
range weapon but maybe it has like some
good<00:01:44.100> synchronization<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.290> other<00:01:46.290> skills

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
good synchronization with other skills

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
good synchronization with other skills
for<00:01:48.060> example<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.860> boat

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
for example you can use the boat

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
for example you can use the boat
teleport<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:50.970> enemies<00:01:51.180> blind<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
teleport to your enemies blind them and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.960 
teleport to your enemies blind them and
then<00:01:52.409> switch<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.710> daggers<00:01:53.220> or<00:01:53.430> something<00:01:53.850> like

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
then switch to daggers or something like

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.880 
then switch to daggers or something like
that<00:01:54.439> now<00:01:55.439> i'm<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.219> put<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:57.890> comp

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that now i'm going to put down a comp

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.359 
that now i'm going to put down a comp
field<00:01:59.250> i<00:01:59.520> had<00:02:00.060> selected<00:02:00.360> someone<00:02:00.750> else<00:02:01.369> i'm

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
field i had selected someone else i'm

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
field i had selected someone else i'm
going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> put<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> comp<00:02:03.270> field<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.689> choking

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
going to put the comp field down choking

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.709 
going to put the comp field down choking
gasps<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> shoot<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.509> my

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
gasps and I'm going to shoot with my

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.440 
gasps and I'm going to shoot with my
first<00:02:07.110> spell<00:02:07.469> right<00:02:07.710> through<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:09.239> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
first spell right through it and as you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.380 
first spell right through it and as you
can<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.050> arrows<00:02:10.649> became<00:02:11.250> green<00:02:11.580> meaning

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
can see the arrows became green meaning

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.309 
can see the arrows became green meaning
that

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
that

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.890 
that
successful<00:02:13.950> interacted<00:02:14.519> with<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.420> compute

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
successful interacted with the compute

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.440 
successful interacted with the compute
they<00:02:16.379> became<00:02:16.680> green<00:02:17.069> because<00:02:17.609> the<00:02:18.030> comb<00:02:18.209> field

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
they became green because the comb field

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.709 
they became green because the comb field
itself<00:02:18.749> is<00:02:18.959> poison<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:20.030> right<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.510> got

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
to say that the combo fields are some

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.089

there<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.989> way<00:02:55.109> they<00:02:55.260> work<00:02:55.469> is<00:02:55.739> somewhat

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
there the way they work is somewhat

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.209
