 elevator in the house on the street was put 11 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 turned off March 25 the most from this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.480
 retirees suffer in the house many of them 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.060
 just live on the upper floors 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.939
 that's for whom the elevator is not a luxury but a means 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 upward movement we are one too 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.190
 the woman is already in hospital now with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.059
 heart from what climbed on 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.270
 this is my neighbor from the eighth floor 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.399
 when she comes back from the store she has 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.180
 I have a rest 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.920

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.370
 years already pensioner of the year you are very difficult 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.710
 7 this time the taste of the spit rise 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.539
 especially when bought something so very 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 it's hard that the elevator is in disrepair 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.559
 it became known two years ago about 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.720
 this informed the house 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.180
 portion control with us special 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.280
 verification committee truth specialists 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.350
 gave the go-ahead for operation a couple more 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 years but the tenants all told it only 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 now when it comes to replacing the elevator 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.750
 entrance will cost 21 1280 lats 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.909
 the tenants say that this amount 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.320
 most of them just don't pull to 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.080
 same on the house hangs debt 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.150
 utility payments over 5000 and all 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 sure tenants management could 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.970
 would help them with installing an elevator by 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.070
 all this portions with us are Chinese 180 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.259
 harker 108 thousand apartments and every 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.560
 pays every house in so and such amounts 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.020
 so oh huge amount and strengthen these 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.270
 means they should help us something 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 then let them help those houses 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.670
 which pine to deliver let them pay 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.640
 then somehow Perry plans on another 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.890
 year these funds despite being forced 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.899
 shutdowns of the elevator and huge estimates on its 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 replacing home control portions with us 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.729
 sympathize with the tenants of the enterprise on 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.190
 maintenance of 250 elevators 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.349
 64 houses and almost all elevators have already been exhausted 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.510
 its resource every year to repair 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.599
 to be born for a half to two hundred thousand 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.730
 lats and there is no accumulation of houses we do not have 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.890
 rights remedy from one house 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.670
 throw to another house we don't have 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 such 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.190
 let's say houses where you could have your own here 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.380
 Eldorado yes we do not know so much here 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.930
 do not know what to do with them but there is no such 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.110
 in this here for a long time become it with 11 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.610
 financial savings for this start 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.280
 years minus 9000 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.170
 everything eats up the maintenance they say in 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.180
 house management tenants assure that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.610
 little is seen new in the house but 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.170
 mailboxes door in the entrance but 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.630
 against the new elevator at its own expense 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.519
 resisted the whole house to the same 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.310
 We learned that the installation of a new doom 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.310
 gave 10 thousand lats why purse in 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.980
 with us requires you to pay the full cost 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.760
 we turned to the Riga City Council with a request 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.540
 finance last year for a replacement 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.340
 elevators in one entrance in this house 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.810
 Veda suburb was able to allocate 10 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.730
 million this year, we received a refusal to 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.980
 management see no other way out 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.350
 pay for a lift replacement in the end 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.450
 all tenants are the owners of their apartments and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.930
 each of them for a new lift should 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.299
 there will be 295 lats but the tenants themselves should 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.769
 find a way to solve the issue of the amount can be 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.750
 break even 3 years 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.609
 she herself portions with us believes that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.069
 capital could find any 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.290
 funding source for renewal 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.569
 all city elevators and townspeople could 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.030
 would buy their lifts at least ten 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.609
 years but still redeem them get 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.540
 This Tatyana Kovalenko and ugly frieze
