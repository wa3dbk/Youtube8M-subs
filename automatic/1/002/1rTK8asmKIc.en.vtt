00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
the past but that's not really the issue

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.669 
the past but that's not really the issue
here<00:01:42.209> WWE<00:01:43.209> had<00:01:43.300> every<00:01:43.660> right<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.110> fire<00:01:44.319> Hogan

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
here WWE had every right to fire Hogan

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.859

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.469 
and they were right in firing Hogan this
move<00:01:47.080> was<00:01:47.229> clearly<00:01:47.739> a<00:01:47.770> cya<00:01:48.399> tactic<00:01:49.209> but<00:01:49.360> it

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
move was clearly a cya tactic but it

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.240 
move was clearly a cya tactic but it
needed<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.899> done<00:01:50.229> in<00:01:50.289> order<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.800> save<00:01:50.979> face

needed to be done in order to save face

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.249 
needed to be done in order to save face
in<00:01:51.519> what<00:01:52.179> some<00:01:52.450> people<00:01:52.599> would<00:01:52.840> call<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:53.140> very

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
in what some people would call a very

someone who's a fan of Chris Benoit I'm

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.220 
someone who's a fan of Chris Benoit I'm
able<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.610> separate<00:02:40.000> Hogan<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.510> wrestler<00:02:40.959> from

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
able to separate Hogan the wrestler from

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.559 
able to separate Hogan the wrestler from
Hogan<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.040> racist<00:02:42.459> he's<00:02:42.610> still<00:02:42.849> my<00:02:43.030> top<00:02:43.329> eight

I<00:02:43.599> think<00:02:43.719> a<00:02:43.930> lot<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.139> that<00:02:44.290> has<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.739> do<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.099> the

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
I think a lot of that has to do with the

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.500 
I think a lot of that has to do with the
fact<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.459> he<00:02:45.639> has<00:02:45.760> not<00:02:45.909> been<00:02:46.090> an<00:02:46.180> active
