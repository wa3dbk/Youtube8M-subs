00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.040 

that's<00:00:36.440> good<00:00:36.739> for<00:00:36.949> our<00:00:37.100> car<00:00:37.430> so

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
that's good for our car so

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.139 
that's good for our car so
this<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.800> good<00:00:40.040> opportunity<00:00:40.160> for<00:00:40.579> us<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.820> do

that and we have

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.729 
that and we have
some<00:00:43.789> hotter<00:00:44.149> conditions<00:00:44.449> today<00:00:45.050> which<00:00:45.500> will

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
some hotter conditions today which will

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.990 
some hotter conditions today which will
reflect<00:00:46.570> what<00:00:48.070> conditions<00:00:49.070> we<00:00:49.399> have<00:00:49.430> going

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
reflect what conditions we have going

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.740 
reflect what conditions we have going
for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
is secret it's really an anomaly

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.920 
is secret it's really an anomaly

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's those long

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.090 
it's those long
we<00:01:08.780> wanted<00:01:09.079> to<00:01:09.140> come<00:01:09.350> here<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.680> test<00:01:09.950> here

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
we wanted to come here and test here

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.120 
we wanted to come here and test here
when<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.790> closer<00:01:12.060> shaft<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> literally<00:01:13.140> fly

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:25.120 

but<00:01:16.670> also<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:17.479> can<00:01:18.430> we<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.610> use<00:01:19.930> dr.<00:01:20.930> Lake

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:34.440 

and<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.670> are<00:01:25.820> very<00:01:25.850> early

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.570 

we<00:01:35.450> have<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.750> learn<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:35.990> lot<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.920> actually<00:01:37.130> for

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
we have to learn a lot so actually for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.160 
we have to learn a lot so actually for
us<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:38.030> very<00:01:38.240> important<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.659> have<00:01:38.840> many

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
us it is very important to have many

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.700 
us it is very important to have many
many<00:01:39.439> fantastic<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:41.240> get<00:01:41.420> ready<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.259> far<00:01:42.530> we

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
many fantastic to get ready so far we

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.070 
many fantastic to get ready so far we
only<00:01:42.740> use<00:01:43.159> two<00:01:43.369> races<00:01:43.759> for<00:01:44.330> us<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.570> learn<00:01:44.750> and

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
only use two races for us to learn and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.279 
only use two races for us to learn and
we<00:01:45.740> did<00:01:45.890> learn<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.100> lot<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.369> quickly<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:47.360> still

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
we did learn a lot and quickly but still

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.070 
we did learn a lot and quickly but still
we<00:01:48.530> feel<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.490> there<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:49.940> more<00:01:50.180> potential<00:01:50.810> and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
we feel that there is more potential and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.279 
we feel that there is more potential and
therefore<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:52.100> we<00:01:52.610> use<00:01:52.940> this<00:01:53.149> little<00:01:53.689> break<00:01:54.049> in

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
therefore we we use this little break in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.490 
therefore we we use this little break in
from<00:01:55.250> second<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.030> third<00:01:56.119> race<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:58.420> explore

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
from second to the third race to explore

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.889 
from second to the third race to explore
our<00:02:00.850> potential<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.030> find<00:02:02.390> better<00:02:02.720> solutions

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
our potential and find better solutions

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.680 
our potential and find better solutions
in<00:02:03.679> all<00:02:03.890> areas<00:02:04.340> who<00:02:04.789> playing<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.450> car

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
in all areas who playing with the car

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.759 
in all areas who playing with the car
and<00:02:06.640> there<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:08.660> know<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.259> many<00:02:09.440> possibilities

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
and there you know so many possibilities

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.190 
and there you know so many possibilities
to<00:02:10.670> improve<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.360> car<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.049> to

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
to improve on the car and we have to

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.080 
to improve on the car and we have to
learn<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.620> basics<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.910> see

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
learn the basics we have to see

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000 
learn the basics we have to see
sometimes<00:02:14.660> some<00:02:15.260> changes<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.560> we<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.709> do

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
sometimes some changes that we can do

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.120 
sometimes some changes that we can do
now<00:02:16.299> they<00:02:17.299> need<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.230> much<00:02:18.380> time<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.890> very

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
now they need so much time it's very

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.490 
now they need so much time it's very
difficult<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.580> achieve<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.989> during<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.319> race

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
difficult to achieve that during a race

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500 
difficult to achieve that during a race
weekend<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.299> perfect

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
weekend so this is the perfect

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.309 
weekend so this is the perfect
opportunity<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.549> done<00:02:25.819> also

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
opportunity to get this done also

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.440 
opportunity to get this done also
evaluate<00:02:28.249> tires<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.120> know<00:02:29.209> different

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
evaluate tires you know different

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.199 
evaluate tires you know different
compounds<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.530> see<00:02:30.859> what<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.189> is<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.060> race

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
compounds and see what it is in the race

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.569 
compounds and see what it is in the race
weekend<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.810> are<00:02:32.930> limited<00:02:33.379> in<00:02:33.680> time<00:02:34.219> you're

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
weekend you are limited in time you're

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.170 
weekend you are limited in time you're
limited<00:02:34.999> in<00:02:35.180> tires<00:02:35.659> so<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:37.280> makes<00:02:37.489> sense<00:02:37.639> to<00:02:37.969> do

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
limited in tires so it makes sense to do

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.510 
limited in tires so it makes sense to do
that<00:02:38.329> now
