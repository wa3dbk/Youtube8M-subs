after<00:02:29.819> we're<00:02:30.150> done<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.660> typically<00:02:31.140> what<00:02:31.739> we

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
after we're done here typically what we

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.199 
after we're done here typically what we
would<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.310> stare<00:02:32.519> down<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.849> engine

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
would do is stare down the engine

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.520 
would do is stare down the engine
inspect<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.780> make<00:02:33.989> sure<00:02:34.019> everything

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830

down<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.989> line<00:02:40.140> just<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.769> all<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.040> other

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
down the line just like all the other

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.690 
down the line just like all the other
engines<00:02:41.549> get<00:02:41.970> installed<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> truck<00:02:46.700> now

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
engines get installed in the truck now

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.030

miles like this on an engine you might

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.530 
miles like this on an engine you might
think<00:02:52.200> that's<00:02:52.920> proof<00:02:53.220> enough<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.239> we're<00:02:54.390> just

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
think that's proof enough but we're just

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.309 
think that's proof enough but we're just
getting<00:02:54.810> started<00:02:56.569> because<00:02:57.569> we're<00:02:58.080> going<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
getting started because we're going to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.400 
getting started because we're going to
take<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.860> same<00:02:59.220> engine<00:02:59.720> out<00:03:00.720> into<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> real

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
take this same engine out into the real

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.300 
take this same engine out into the real
world<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:03.480> some<00:03:03.630> real<00:03:03.870> torture
