00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.290
 Of course it should celebrate the clear America 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.759
 that he must be happy and they must 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.980
 to be having a very nice night 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.680
 in montreal but also of being 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.690
 realistic and they must also have 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.180
 the exact assessment of what they have 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.830
 got a tournament a tournament that has 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.650
 the obligation the Mexican soccer of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.720
 always win it in any of the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.090
 editions with any of the rivals 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.380
 I would not have to suffer football 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.180
 Mexican as he has suffered in the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.800
 This has been the last years 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.680
 greater suffering with it 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.539
 inoperance for the same inability to 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.420
 many footballers who must 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.100
 to value continuing or not continuing in 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.719
 the america on the part of Ricardo Peláez and 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.899
 of Roman pepe and of course yon de 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.690
 Luisa is worth a shame to see 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.309
 players who do not have the highest delivery 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.920
 the lowest competitive level and that 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.809
 there were so many thousands of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.799
 dollars I mean here you have to say 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.920
 things as they are 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.329
 I mean Darwin Quintero, I mean 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.429
 to paolo goltz that today he did not play to be 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.079
 suspended because it bursts or almost 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.230
 capita him a football player 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.510
 Heredian 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.850
 pablo aguilar no a paul aguilar a pablo 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.370
 aguilar I also mean some 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 others like cristian pellerano players 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.100
 that they were supposed to score 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.840
 difference and that's why they came to the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.790
 american or have not served at all not 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 it serves to damn the thing the friend 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.390
 he has time to reinforce himself and he does not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400
 the piece of paper they have made 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 blue cross he has made in Monterrey that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 has done the pachuca and themselves in the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.830
 club world the units have to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.000
 go to compete the soccer vicars because 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.610
 it would have to be much more than the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.080
 South American but much more and it would have 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.300
 that being always playing will be the final 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.450
 against European teams that would 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.990
 to be natural but not born that way 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.180
 because they take things for a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.400
 very little planning to be able to 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.970
 get to japan in December as it will be 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.760
 this year the concacaf should not be a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.010
 rival only that of concacaf should not be 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.320
 then some rivals that worry the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.750
 Mexican football at club level today the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 monte team played with a goalkeeper 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 who was surely a cook or 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.480
 surely he was a baker or surely 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.610
 He was a carpenter but he was not a goalie 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.750
 no idea and if nothing else check the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 goals in short 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.270
 This will be America that can more than 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.830
 celebrate but also reconsider what 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.450
 what he has been doing in these first 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
 months the most winning team of the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 history of mexico without a doubt the team 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.410
 that today has marked with gustavo matosas 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.030
 another immediate success in this era of 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.300
 ricado peláez pp román y yon de luisa 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.860
 three months ago a little more than three 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.390
 months winning the league title with 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 antonio mohamed today 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.950
 matosas in four months in the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.480
 institution has already won a degree a lot 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.580
 faster than he did 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.170
 kill me sorry that he did mohamed and that 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.940
 he did the same miguel herrera yes that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.770
 Well, you're talking about the great 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.200
 football institution the moment in 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.239
 mexico why the demand is much 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.770
 There are also many detractors of the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.410
 Americanism of course there are 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.450
 many and will be slaughtering more 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.220
 taking out the managers that's why 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.810
 envy only for the living 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.810
 we start is this sport is total
