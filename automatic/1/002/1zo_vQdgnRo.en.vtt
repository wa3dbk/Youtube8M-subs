00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 we now take a look at ours 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 neighbors in the north in denmark has ours 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.980
 shoot a big contractor 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.710
 visited his heart beats for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.120
 Large tractors of the company Massey Ferguson 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.929
 but a new model that comes to them 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.929
 not in the stall 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 a steady wind blows over the flat 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.020
 land the sun lets the infinite 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 far even larger seem here at the top 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.650
 in the north of denmark at danish 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.379
 Ostseeküste is no matter where others 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.860
 make holiday pons had its teller 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.989
 he has 55 hectares of land from his farm 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.390
 inherited father but now has the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.129
 64-year-old one of the biggest 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.129
 contractor of the region 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.670
 this is my first tractor to have 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.470
 In 1982 I bought this 1200 solid layer 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 It always had to be a press at first 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.500
 pull 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.909
 the tractor always overheats us constantly 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.530
 had to come up with something 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.450
 That's why we have the grille 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 but now he could but at 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 backwind came the straw always in the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.630
 engine and therefore the driver has one 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.970
 own grille developed and with 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.509
 This edge was finally here 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.359
 solved translation problem and be 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.609
 first 1200 he still has money 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.210
 therefore deserve it even today 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.869
 commitment 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.789
 according to serial number this tractor is the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.079
 27 of his kind by massey ferguson 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.170
 was built 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.509
 He had 100 ps when he left the factory 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.289
 but Bastel app has a turbo 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.909
 built-in 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:51.179
 and now it brings his first on proud 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:55.109
 150 hp the first really big tractor 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.960
 the m 11 48 80 came used from england 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:03.329
 two more will follow soon 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.819
 one 48 40 and another 48 80 and 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.869
 also these two buying tips needed as 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:13.459
 So far, every one of his tractors in Canada 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.290
 he finally found the big one 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.440
 4900, of course, was not anymore 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.420
 very new and found poncher had him 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.069
 even with a danish dealer 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.150
 who does his business in north america 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.310
 it became a fruitful one 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.459
 business relationship because even today 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.260
 buy tip there his spare parts his 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.690
 newest used come however 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:44.120
 once again from england the coincidence 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:45.849
 it wanted such an English mf dealer 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.349
 called me and said I have 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.739
 248 80 who are no longer with me 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.329
 business 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.640
 Do you want to buy them and I have 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:57.980
 Of course, yes said so drove his son 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.650
 with a container going on and has this 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.620
 Mass ferguson brought in items 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.200
 And from this iron heap they should 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.760
 now again his two new ones are born 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:15.980
 not a single tractor or trailer 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.680
 Looks in this payroll company like this 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.739
 from how he left the factory here 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 Everything will be your own needs 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.530
 customized welded and tinkered 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.500
 fiddled 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.109
 This workshop is still a real one 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.669
 Workshop 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.060
 besides, everyone has their own 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:39.709
 tractor lays out are quite teller 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.989
 special value that is ours 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.970
 company policy everyone has their tractor 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.560
 He first has to diverge 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.419
 take and then reassemble 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.799
 after that it is one and so it is 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.799
 rather connected with him 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.489
 this mass ferguson has a 465 ps 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.099
 Panzer engine as a new heart has before 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.609
 a few years ago the danish army 7 of 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.739
 bought these engines and despite the 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.440
 higher performance is the work 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.850
 with the big one 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:18.340
 Schöbel the absolute limit for the mf 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:21.220
 4900 because the mf4 1909 has 465 hp 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.260
 he has too high a torque and 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.900
 by the enormous trailer load of the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.360
 skull of almost 15 tons is the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.890
 rear axle actually still too 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.250
 far too high if the writing wrong 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:53.680
 is the fjord are only 4 km h at 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:55.630
 465 ps and that's why there always is 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.150
 work again in the workshop 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.900
 because apps tractor tuning survive 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.760
 axles and gears seldom have it around 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.710
 the danish wage earner, too 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.470
 four spare gear to go there 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.780
 peter hansen in his 11 4900 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.180
 meanwhile, a wet spot should open 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.310
 drain this blow by the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.590
 laser control produces 1 10 per mil 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.430
 fall with it the water again 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.430
 can drain away 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.340
 and then it happened the massey 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.199
 Ferguson has to go to the workshop 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.479
 the big kink tractor has to kink 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.430
 joint will be taken apart 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.099
 have to go fast because the next day 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.530
 the over 20 years old giant is already 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.569
 be back in action 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.759
 In just under two hours, Peter has 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.580
 hansen disassembled his tractor 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:56.120
 he is already working for it for ten years 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.909
 and the mf 4900 he has already several times 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.620
 have to take apart 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:04.750
 and again, despite all 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.750
 made caution the material limp 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.680
 the little mass ferguson stood on 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:16.099
 beginning of monza life as a farmer 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.460
 and at the end of his life when his 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:22.750
 time has expired this 1200 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.750
 also stand 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.069
 I'll be fine if I'm not 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.279
 my son is supposed to be with me on the earth 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.349
 the first 1200 I bought in 1982 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.150
 have to go to funeral and on the 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.680
 cemetery he is supposed to say then 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.680
 to cover two straw bales 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:50.479
 but who still tips his 1200 himself 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:55.719
 here in beckedahl his birthplace there 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:55.719
 where everything started at 150 ps
