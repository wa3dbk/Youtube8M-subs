Ryback<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.650> absolute<00:01:13.650> huge<00:01:14.270> entity<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Ryback was an absolute huge entity and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.719 
Ryback was an absolute huge entity and
WBE<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:17.630> Mark<00:01:18.630> Henry<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.140> he<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.409> big

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
WBE and Mark Henry you know he was big

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.920 
WBE and Mark Henry you know he was big
but<00:01:20.930> when<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.170> year<00:01:22.409> passes<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:23.159> had<00:01:23.869> these<00:01:24.869> two

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
but when a year passes we had these two

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.440 
but when a year passes we had these two
at<00:01:25.290> WrestleMania<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.790> seemed<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.210> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
at WrestleMania and it seemed like this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
at WrestleMania and it seemed like this
was<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> guarantee<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> Ryback<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.950> beat

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
was the guarantee that Ryback would beat

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.319 
was the guarantee that Ryback would beat
Mark<00:01:29.369> Henry<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:29.939> kind<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> put

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
Mark Henry and that would kind of put

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
Mark Henry and that would kind of put
him<00:01:30.420> back<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.770> swing<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> things

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
him back into the good swing of things

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.670 
him back into the good swing of things
and<00:01:32.689> Mark<00:01:33.689> Henry<00:01:33.810> ends<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.200> winning<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> we
