00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.200
Now that we have taken a look at the basics
of HD index painting, we can delve further

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.930
into its practical uses.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.990
In this video, I want to share with you 7
tips to get a better hang of HD index painting

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.700
and its power.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.330
Tips number one: start with a painting.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.310
You should generally start with a quick painting
in grayscale or in color, without worrying

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.009
about the final pixel art.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.359
At this point, what matters the most is to
prepare the composition of your image, but

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.199
also to have a pleasant time.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.290
Actually, the HD Index technique gives us
the freedom to draw the way we want to, with

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.370
any resolution, as we will always be able
to transform our creation in pixel art later.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.360
Tips number 2: the 4 steps to change a painting
into pixel art.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.390
Here’s how I proceed to transform a painting
into a pixel art:

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.040
First of all, you can prepare your color palette
on a new layer.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.850
We have to sample the main colors of every
key element in our painting one by one.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.729
After that, it is sometimes necessary to remove
the characters and other gameplay related

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.420
sprites, which are hard to draw properly using
HD Index painting.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.060
It is more interesting to redraw them by hand
in order to make them pop.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.960
Then, we downscale our painting, to adapt
its scale to pixel art.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.450
To do that in Krita, we have to go to the
image menu, and select the Scale Image to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.090
New Size option.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.399
We can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl
Alt I.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.909
In general, I use a value of less than 200
pixels for the image’s width and height.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.310
The 4th step is the most tedious of all: we
have to desaturate the image, and then cut

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.920
a piece of it for each color palette or layers
we want.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.649
We then have to create multiple layer groups
with the index colors filter, as we have seen

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.540
in the previous video.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.909
And once this is done, we can paint freely
and benefit from the real-time color indexing.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.750
Note that this process also works with textures
and other photos.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.080
Tips number 3: Ctrl Alt Click to sample the
right colors.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.480
When we are painting with indexed colors,
if we sample a color or a dithering pattern

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.690
on our layer using the control key, you’ll
notice that we can’t really paint with it.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.130
This manipulation fetches a color from the
screen.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.320
Instead, we want to select the grayscale value
that is contained inside our painting layer,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.400
not a screen color.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.060
Krita provides a shortcut to grab a color
from the active layer: we have to press the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.650
Ctrl and Alt keys, and click on the canvas.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.550
For this to work, we need to select the layer
on which we are painting.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.430
Thanks to this tool, we can sample the value
corresponding to a dithering pattern and paint

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.000
with it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.600
Tips number 4: groups limit the scope of filter
layers.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.980
By default, a filter is only applied to the
group it belongs to.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.930
Thus, you can put as many filters as you want
inside of a group, they will not affect the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.820
rest of the painting.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.740
If you want a filter to affect the entire
image, you have to put it outside of the group,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.480
at the top of the layer stack.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.180
Or you can activate the Pass Through option
on its group in the layer docker.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.010
Tips number 5: use gradients to quickly add
shadows and light on your painting.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.980
Gradients synergize really well with the preserve
alpha option.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.820
I always work with the default gradient type,
which applies your foreground color with transparency.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.100
You just have to pick a dark gray to add shadows
to the painting, and a lighter tone to add

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.100
light.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.760
You can also combine gradients with selections
to add shadows and lights to specific portions

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.820
of your composition.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.900
Tips number 6: Draw silhouette fast with the
Outline Selection Tool.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.430
Speaking of selections, the Outline tool is
very efficient to plot the silhouette of your

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.120
trees, your clouds, or simply to add details
to your creation.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.691
You just have to draw a selection, and then
fill it either using the fill tool, or by

00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:13.220
using the Shift Backspace key combination.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.790
This shortcut fills the selection with your
foreground color.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.220
By pressing the Backspace key alone, you can
fill the selection using the background color.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.520
This technique is good for the creation of
silhouettes, but not only!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.340
It also allows us to draw sharp details over
a layer, or to add shadows and lights to specific

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.099
areas using soft brushes or the gradient tool.

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.710
And tips number 7: you can stack filters.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.139
There are many painting techniques I haven’t
shown you yet on the channel.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.689
Thus for some of you, the HD index painting
technique may look a bit limited.

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.020
The small layer stack I showed you in the
previous tutorial is only the base upon which

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.870
you can build freely.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.550
In Krita, you can pile up as many layers and
filters as you need to.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.850
As I have a hard time controlling my color
palette with the index colors filter alone,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.300
I use other filters like Levels or Color Balance
to fine tune or even radically change the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.539
look of my pixel art.

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.699
All of the filters I use the most are basic
ones as far as digital painting is concerned.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.870
You will find them in most image editing software.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:27.379
In the add filter window, you can find them
all under the first category, called Adjust.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:32.160
On top of this week’s pixel art example,
I’ve prepared an HD index painting template

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
for you.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.169
Credit goes to Amadiro for all of the dithering
textures.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.999
This file gives you a basic structure as well
as a few predefined filters to facilitate

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.819
the creation of a pixel art illustration.

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.550
You can find the download link in the video
description.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.340
This week, I invite you to head over to the
Pixel Dailies twitter page.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.710
There, you will find a daily pixel art exercise
to sharpen your skills.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.969
The themes sometimes come with some stylistic
or size constraints, but most of the time

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.520
you should be able to use the HD index painting
technique.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.969
Don’t hesitate to tweet your creations using
the #pixelart hashtag, and @pixel_dailies

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.639
for everyone to see it!

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.020
