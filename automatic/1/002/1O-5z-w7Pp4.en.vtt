00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610 

I<00:00:00.060> I<00:00:00.359> think<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.290> most<00:00:01.580> significant<00:00:02.580> change<00:00:02.970> is

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
I I think the most significant change is

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.930 
I I think the most significant change is
the<00:00:04.819> development<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.359> computer<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.940> just

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
the development of the computer I just

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.320 
the development of the computer I just
didn't<00:00:09.740> dream<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.550> would<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:12.030> so

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
didn't dream that it would be so

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.220 
didn't dream that it would be so
influential<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.910> remember<00:00:14.910> at<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.020> beginning

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
influential I remember at the beginning

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.570 
influential I remember at the beginning
there<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:18.619> neighbors<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.859> ours<00:00:20.010> were

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
there was the neighbors of ours were

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.540 
there was the neighbors of ours were
worked<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.390> computers<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.910> they<00:00:23.910> were<00:00:24.529> big

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
worked on computers and they were big

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.780 
worked on computers and they were big
rooms<00:00:26.550> where<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.570> had<00:00:28.849> maybe<00:00:29.849> hundreds<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
rooms where you had maybe hundreds of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.500 
rooms where you had maybe hundreds of
individual<00:00:32.790> cells<00:00:34.250> very<00:00:35.250> complicated<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
individual cells very complicated and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.840 
individual cells very complicated and
then<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> heard<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.690> university<00:00:39.690> was

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
then I heard that the university was

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.569 
then I heard that the university was
establishing<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.239> department<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.350> computers<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
establishing a department of computers I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260 
establishing a department of computers I
couldn't<00:00:45.510> understand<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.710> importance<00:00:47.340> but

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
couldn't understand the importance but

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.439 
couldn't understand the importance but
the<00:00:48.510> computer<00:00:49.230> has<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:50.070> seized<00:00:50.789> control

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the computer has really seized control

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.099 
the computer has really seized control
of<00:00:51.809> our<00:00:52.289> lives<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.690> has<00:00:54.690> become<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
of our lives and has become a

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
of our lives and has become a
transforming<00:00:58.430> tool<00:00:59.430> which<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.359> different

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
transforming tool which is different

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.950 
transforming tool which is different
from<00:01:01.910> anything<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.390> had<00:01:03.690> before<00:01:04.670> just

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
from anything we had before just

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.399 
from anything we had before just
astonishing<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.530> permits<00:01:08.330> results<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:10.170> we

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
astonishing it permits results which we

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.700 
astonishing it permits results which we
never<00:01:10.710> dreamed<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.049> remember<00:01:13.049> towards<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
never dreamed of I remember towards the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.429 
never dreamed of I remember towards the
beginning<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.760> development<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
beginning of the development of the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.920 
beginning of the development of the
computer<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:19.310> John<00:01:20.310> Hancock<00:01:20.670> building<00:01:21.030> was

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
computer the John Hancock building was

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.249 
computer the John Hancock building was
being<00:01:22.259> erected<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.450> someone<00:01:24.450> told<00:01:24.689> me<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
being erected and someone told me that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.819 
being erected and someone told me that
the<00:01:25.890> architects<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.560> John<00:01:28.560> Hancock

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the architects for the John Hancock

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
the architects for the John Hancock
willing<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.119> required<00:01:30.890> two<00:01:31.890> years<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
willing would have required two years to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.130 
willing would have required two years to
do<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.290> drawings<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.140> calculations

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
do all the drawings and the calculations

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.350 
do all the drawings and the calculations
necessary<00:01:37.939> but<00:01:38.939> thanks<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> computers

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
necessary but thanks to the computers

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
necessary but thanks to the computers
they<00:01:42.360> were<00:01:42.450> able<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.930> complete<00:01:43.590> them<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.009> two

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
they were able to complete them in two

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
they were able to complete them in two
months<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:46.140> course<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:47.390> much<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.750> less

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
months and of course now much much less

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.990 
months and of course now much much less
yes<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.770> think<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.520> most

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.319 

transforming<00:01:57.000> element<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
transforming element of

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.950 
transforming element of
of<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.689> century<00:02:00.320> I've<00:02:00.560> lived
