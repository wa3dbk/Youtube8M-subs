I'm<00:03:08.239> just<00:03:08.480> left<00:03:09.079> this<00:03:09.319> one<00:03:09.709> right<00:03:10.190> because

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
I'm just left this one right because

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.220 
I'm just left this one right because
they<00:03:11.390> don't<00:03:11.420> want<00:03:11.629> to<00:03:11.690> make<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.959> any<00:03:12.110> other

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
they don't want to make it any other

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.830 
they don't want to make it any other
color<00:03:12.519> here's<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.670> soup<00:03:13.940> in<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.180> bowl<00:03:14.209> the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
color here's the soup in the bowl the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.140 
color here's the soup in the bowl the
soup<00:03:15.079> is<00:03:15.230> very<00:03:15.349> simple<00:03:15.980> very<00:03:16.010> basic<00:03:16.549> but<00:03:17.090> I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
soup is very simple very basic but I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.120 
soup is very simple very basic but I
think<00:03:17.420> sometimes<00:03:17.989> that's<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> best<00:03:18.650> kind<00:03:19.010> of

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
think sometimes that's the best kind of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.770 
think sometimes that's the best kind of
soup<00:03:19.370> just<00:03:19.790> because<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.239> looks<00:03:20.389> pretty<00:03:20.630> nice

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
soup just because it looks pretty nice

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.059 
soup just because it looks pretty nice
and<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:21.970> basic<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.769> think<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.040> looks

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
and it's basic and I just think it looks

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.800 
and it's basic and I just think it looks
good

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
good

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.690 
good
here's<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.079> mushrooms<00:03:27.859> again<00:03:28.220> from<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
here's the mushrooms again from the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.390 
here's the mushrooms again from the
snowpack<00:03:29.230> here<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.650> water<00:03:30.859> particles

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
snowpack here is the water particles

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.819 
snowpack here is the water particles
also<00:03:31.730> are<00:03:31.970> used<00:03:32.180> many<00:03:32.420> times<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.290> fire<00:03:33.590> is

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
also are used many times the fire is

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.370 
also are used many times the fire is
pink<00:03:34.130> it's<00:03:34.430> low<00:03:34.730> fire<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.510> as<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.079> can<00:03:36.230> see

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
pink it's low fire and as you can see

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.420 
pink it's low fire and as you can see
it's<00:03:36.500> pink<00:03:36.709> right<00:03:36.859> there<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.190> very<00:03:40.190> low

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
it's pink right there and it is very low

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.789 
it's pink right there and it is very low
so<00:03:40.940> that's<00:03:41.090> good<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.299> PDP<00:03:41.720> with<00:03:41.900> its<00:03:42.530> flowing

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
so that's good to PDP with its flowing

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.039 
so that's good to PDP with its flowing
lava<00:03:43.040> flowing<00:03:43.489> water<00:03:44.470> here<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:46.959> what<00:03:47.959> we

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
lava flowing water here is the what we

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.979 
lava flowing water here is the what we
call<00:03:48.200> fire<00:03:48.790> pink<00:03:49.790> because<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.540> theme<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.810> this

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
call fire pink because the theme of this

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.150 
call fire pink because the theme of this
pack<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.380> pink<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:53.290> now<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.709> particles

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
pack is pink and now on to the particles

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.770 
pack is pink and now on to the particles
so<00:03:55.910> whoops<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.370> these<00:03:58.669> are<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:58.970> traits<00:03:59.299> they

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
so whoops so these are the traits they

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.120 
so whoops so these are the traits they
are<00:04:00.049> just<00:04:00.440> speak<00:04:01.569> English<00:04:02.650> almost<00:04:03.650> purple<00:04:04.069> I
