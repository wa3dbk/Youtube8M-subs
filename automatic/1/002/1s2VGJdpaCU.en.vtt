00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.530
They crunchy, and delicious, and
good for me googly eyes.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.930
But that not mean that--

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.330

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.700
He loves cookies.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.040
In fact, I'm baking him
cookies right now.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.755

A singing competition

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.510

only using their superstar

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.830
Casey, you should have
been more careful.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.230

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.430
TRAIN: [SINGING]

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.230
We were counting, finding
the amount then.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.630
We counted up to five.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.430

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.930
