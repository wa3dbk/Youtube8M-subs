00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.760
 Let's go the ingredients 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830
 first to set up a frying pan 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.900
 I use the smart bullet. 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.100
 thanks for the sad for the product 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:40.800
 now the leaders of the war in 2001 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.840
 usually I use a million cook has 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 no problem 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 Durango but the taste of each one 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 four eggs, four of which are one 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.239
 Palocci gem already cooked I use mine 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.239
 any 50 grams 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.190
 but there are people who can use 100 grams 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.940
 depends on your diet depends on the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.130
 amount you use a spoon 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:13.530
 such as I like the wine and let it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 it's own and has two ingredients in it. 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 today's stage of pleasure that is the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.970
 cinnamon powder you can use a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 coffee spoon and ten drops of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 vanilla essence that I love 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:35.930
 I do not know but this one puts everything in 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.930
 order has nothing just left 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.580
 just like I do here in the enchanted fire 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.670
 How did you guys leave and not very tall? 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 seem a bit when any one of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.320
 new the whole thing in this you go of today 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.650

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.650

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.010
 i 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.670

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:04.020
 two with land and to finish 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:08.110
 who is going to make this delicious low already in a 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.420
 month the college did not go to have one more 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.420
 to america and together with us 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.790
 the order was made looks more beautiful 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.790

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:47.080
 there we respect one loves the island gives a 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:50.920
 look at this panel as far away will 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:56.830
 of eating candy supplies much much more than 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:59.680
 true if you want if you can 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.850
 You can put a banana on a banana too. 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.120
 makes an excellent wonder 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:10.560
 I really do love it, but unfortunately. 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.780
 I can not put a current diet there. 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.780
