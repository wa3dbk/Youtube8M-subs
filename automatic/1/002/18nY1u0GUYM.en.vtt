particular<00:00:28.919> ratio<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.769> use<00:00:31.919> either

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
particular ratio in you can use either

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.350 
particular ratio in you can use either

that se or the SEL the one the only
difference<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> long<00:00:37.230> wheelbase

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
difference there is the long wheelbase

difference there is the long wheelbase
they<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.989> 3.7<00:00:39.989> rear-end<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
they all have the 3.7 rear-end but it is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.110 
they all have the 3.7 rear-end but it is
a<00:00:42.809> 1:08<00:00:43.170> chassis<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.940> v8<00:00:45.920> 4.5<00:00:47.120> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
a 1:08 chassis and it's the v8 4.5 you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.400 
a 1:08 chassis and it's the v8 4.5 you
don't<00:00:48.359> want<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> pick<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> car<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.230> air

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
don't want to pick a car with air
suspension<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.609> different

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
suspension because they have a different

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.930 
suspension because they have a different
rear<00:00:51.539> axle<00:00:52.019> and<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.410> interchangeable

rear axle and it's not interchangeable

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.310 
rear axle and it's not interchangeable
so<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.359> to<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.480> careful<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.019> get<00:00:55.289> a

bought for a donor thoroughly reasonable

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.550

but<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.590> couldn't<00:01:16.590> quite<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:17.490> myself<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.560> part

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
but I couldn't quite get myself to part

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.730 
but I couldn't quite get myself to part
it<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.790> may<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> fixed<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it out so it may get fixed but this is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.630 
it out so it may get fixed but this is
the<00:01:22.920> model<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.400> looking<00:01:23.760> for

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420 

these<00:01:27.030> VA<00:01:27.650> differentials<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.860> problem

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
these VA differentials have a problem

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.630 
these VA differentials have a problem
the<00:01:29.550> v8<00:01:29.820> engine<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.720> much<00:01:30.870> more<00:01:31.140> torque

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the v8 engine has so much more torque

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
the v8 engine has so much more torque
even<00:01:32.640> though<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:32.910> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> bigger<00:01:33.750> ring<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
even though it is a bigger ring and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.490 
even though it is a bigger ring and
pinion<00:01:34.590> gear<00:01:34.980> the<00:01:35.670> yoke<00:01:36.450> assembly<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.380> the

pinion gear the yoke assembly with the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.010 
pinion gear the yoke assembly with the
pin<00:01:37.910> will<00:01:38.910> actually<00:01:39.330> wear<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.260> you'll<00:01:40.470> have

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
pin will actually wear so you'll have

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.950 
pin will actually wear so you'll have
way<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.080> much<00:01:43.320> slop<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.790> unit<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
way too much slop in the unit now here I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.050 
way too much slop in the unit now here I
have<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.290> wheel<00:01:46.500> jacked<00:01:46.830> off<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> ground<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
have one wheel jacked off the ground the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.310 
have one wheel jacked off the ground the
other<00:01:48.240> wheel<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.869> ground<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.260> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
other wheel on the ground and the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.740 
other wheel on the ground and the
driveshaft<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:50.490> moving<00:01:50.940> -<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.420> plays

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
driveshaft not moving - all this plays

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.500 
driveshaft not moving - all this plays
in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> differential<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.060> rear<00:01:54.240> ends

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
in the differential and in the rear ends

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.570 
in the differential and in the rear ends
not<00:01:54.690> winding<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.440> don't<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.130> gear

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
not winding so I don't think it's gear

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:11.780 
not winding so I don't think it's gear
where<00:02:08.149> see<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> drive<00:02:09.479> step<00:02:10.220> yeah<00:02:11.220> drive

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
where see the drive step yeah drive

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.410 
where see the drive step yeah drive
shafts<00:02:12.120> are<00:02:12.330> moving<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.959> got<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:14.150> slop<00:02:15.150> like

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
shafts are moving you got a slop like

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.620 
shafts are moving you got a slop like
that<00:02:15.690> yeah<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.410> have<00:02:16.680> where<00:02:20.270> yeah<00:02:21.270> there's<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that yeah you have where yeah there's a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.290 
that yeah you have where yeah there's a
speck<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.260> manual<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.430> when<00:02:24.209> you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
speck in that manual for this when you

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.140 
speck in that manual for this when you
put<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> wheel<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.140> even<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> lot<00:02:25.650> more

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
put the wheel on it's even a lot more

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.180 
put the wheel on it's even a lot more
some<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.330> too<00:02:27.540> much<00:02:27.690> yeah<00:02:28.050> yeah<00:02:28.560> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
some of this too much yeah yeah but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.699 
some of this too much yeah yeah but
you're<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.550> find<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.750> when<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.140> open<00:02:31.500> up

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
you're going to find is when you open up

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.090 
you're going to find is when you open up
the<00:02:31.860> differential<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:34.049> casting<00:02:34.860> will<00:02:34.980> be

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the differential the the casting will be

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.180 
the differential the the casting will be
worn<00:02:35.340> around<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.730> yolk<00:02:35.970> assembly<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
worn around the yolk assembly so this is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
worn around the yolk assembly so this is
the<00:02:41.370> yolk<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.790> spider<00:02:42.060> gear<00:02:42.390> assembly<00:02:42.690> off

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the yolk and spider gear assembly off

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.070 
the yolk and spider gear assembly off
the<00:02:43.260> standard<00:02:43.799> axle<00:02:44.430> which<00:02:44.640> would<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.080> 113

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the standard axle which would be on 113

here so what you're seeing when I on

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.810 
here so what you're seeing when I on
that<00:03:09.630> car<00:03:09.930> over<00:03:10.230> there<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.560> actually<00:03:11.489> it's

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
that car over there is actually it's

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.280 
that car over there is actually it's
been<00:03:12.030> moving<00:03:12.360> back<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.750> forth<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
casting it's worn probably quite a bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.319 
casting it's worn probably quite a bit
more<00:03:15.269> than<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.690> one<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.940> would<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:18.150> be

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
more than this one so this would not be

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.569 
more than this one so this would not be
a<00:03:18.510> good<00:03:18.690> donor<00:03:18.959> car<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.980> something<00:03:20.370> should

a good donor car that something should
be<00:03:20.670> checked<00:03:21.000> before<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:22.370> purchase<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.579> rear

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
be checked before you purchase a rear

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.229 
be checked before you purchase a rear
end<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.810> put<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.290> your<00:03:25.410> car

end and put it in your car

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.870 
end and put it in your car
these<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:28.019> be<00:03:28.049> repaired<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.670> that's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
these can be repaired but that's

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.840 
these can be repaired but that's
something<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.329> have<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.540> consider<00:03:31.850> normally

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
something you have to consider normally

something you have to consider normally
the<00:03:33.030> quick<00:03:33.239> fix<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the quick fix is a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.800 
the quick fix is a
viii<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.209> out<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.720> find<00:03:37.050> someone<00:03:37.670> welding

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
viii it out and find someone welding

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.589 
viii it out and find someone welding
castings<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.410> weld<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.099> solid<00:03:41.599> the

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
castings and just weld it in solid the

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.360 
castings and just weld it in solid the
correct<00:03:42.870> way<00:03:43.050> maybe<00:03:43.349> to<00:03:43.500> take<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.950> all<00:03:44.040> apart

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
correct way maybe to take it all apart

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.369 
correct way maybe to take it all apart
and<00:03:44.519> machine<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.239> weld<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.260> that's

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
and machine it out weld it up but that's

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.229 
and machine it out weld it up but that's
so<00:03:47.010> being<00:03:47.220> expensive<00:03:47.580> where<00:03:48.000> you're<00:03:48.120> gonna

so being expensive where you're gonna

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.710 
so being expensive where you're gonna
find<00:03:48.300> a<00:03:48.599> gear<00:03:49.140> ratio<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.310> rear<00:03:50.670> axle<00:03:51.180> Alex

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
and that's the most important thing the

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.189 
and that's the most important thing the
rubber<00:07:12.069> axle<00:07:12.490> boot<00:07:12.669> right<00:07:12.909> here<00:07:13.180> a<00:07:13.300> lot<00:07:14.080> of

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
rubber axle boot right here a lot of

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.700 
rubber axle boot right here a lot of
times<00:07:14.349> the<00:07:14.500> boodle<00:07:14.830> still<00:07:15.069> be<00:07:15.219> good<00:07:15.490> but<00:07:16.710> the

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
times the boodle still be good but the

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.200 
times the boodle still be good but the
clamps<00:07:18.039> will<00:07:18.159> get<00:07:18.339> so<00:07:18.490> old<00:07:18.729> that<00:07:18.939> they'll

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
clamps will get so old that they'll

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:25.219 
clamps will get so old that they'll
break<00:07:19.449> in<00:07:20.520> like<00:07:21.520> that<00:07:21.849> and<00:07:22.529> and<00:07:23.529> they<00:07:24.279> make<00:07:24.520> a

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229 
break in like that and and they make a

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:30.269 
break in like that and and they make a
split<00:07:26.229> boot<00:07:26.529> it<00:07:28.409> doesn't<00:07:29.409> work<00:07:29.529> as<00:07:29.710> well<00:07:29.949> it's

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:30.279 
split boot it doesn't work as well it's

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.600 
split boot it doesn't work as well it's
like<00:07:30.400> a<00:07:30.849> temporary<00:07:31.589> repair<00:07:32.589> most<00:07:32.860> people<00:07:33.250> feel

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610 
like a temporary repair most people feel

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.060 
like a temporary repair most people feel
but<00:07:35.099> the<00:07:36.099> solid<00:07:36.460> boot<00:07:36.699> is<00:07:37.000> the<00:07:37.810> best

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.070 
but the solid boot is the best

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.480 
but the solid boot is the best
solution<00:07:40.060> but<00:07:40.540> is<00:07:40.660> a<00:07:40.690> lot<00:07:40.930> of<00:07:41.080> work<00:07:41.490> but

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.490 
solution but is a lot of work but

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.650 
solution but is a lot of work but
basically<00:07:43.420> pretty<00:07:43.690> straightforward<00:07:44.410> job

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 
basically pretty straightforward job

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.660 
basically pretty straightforward job
essentially<00:07:46.660> that's<00:07:47.530> it<00:07:47.860> everything<00:07:48.130> else<00:07:48.460> is

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:48.670 
essentially that's it everything else is

00:07:48.670 --> 00:08:05.080 
essentially that's it everything else is
a<00:07:48.700> direct<00:07:49.240> changeover

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.090 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.150
