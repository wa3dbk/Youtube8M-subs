00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.700
 and anthony together talking about keyboards 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.349
 today we talked a lot about 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 touch on mobile phones and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.380
 well the good old keyboard with keys on 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.630
 thought they were going to disappear 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.289
 they came here they are there I have 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 I must be happy that ends I have one 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.680
 little tired touch keyboards I know 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.029
 not if you're like me but there is the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.910
 famous fat fingers effect you know 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 when you write a text and that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 plants completely because you are 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 miss a letter on two finals on Tuesday 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.110
 so here's the solution that's it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.610
 what's called a projected keyboard 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
 it's a little cube that will be clipped 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 to your phone and who will project a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 virtual keyboard on any 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.110
 surface and you're going to be able to type 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 on it much more comfortably than 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.230
 on your little phone screen it's 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.610
 nice and it makes the same noise 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.510
 than when you type on a keyboard 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.649
 computer 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.030
 so there is this little effect then it's 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.160
 very colorful it's very festive I like 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.829
 well no we also have the trick their role to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.329
 bhl here is the real nightmare at all 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.320
 break the rhythm it works like a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.030
 post or as a sheet of paper 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.769
 actually we can we can roll it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 and it comes to life from the moment it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.380
 imposes on a solid surface so on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.210
 a table for example on his knees little 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 then imports it can we can use it 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 like that like a keyboard so that can 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.610
 to be practical when you want to write a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 long message for example when one is 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 in a train we do not want to go out 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.990
 laptop is proof of this as the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 young girl there who is writing 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.070
 a text in the restaurant yes it's not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 very is not very nice for her friend 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 not one here on the other hand when we 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.509
 is in a train we can afford 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 actually take his time from 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.630
 take out his little keyboard to unroll it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.600
 and to roll when we finished then we 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.460
 always gives the inflatable keyboard 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.630
 in inflatable while for it works 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.549
 the inflatable keyboard is actually a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 prototype I'm explaining you have a 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.619
 plastic film that you place on a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.960
 touch screen and under this movie you have 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 a young special that will inflate 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.530
 that will make some parts come out 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 precise screen for example 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.310
 it's amazing then you go 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.750
 want to type a number for example a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.000
 phone number makes you spring 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.360
 the keys like that to the envy and that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.710
 market 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.909
 this is for the moment it's a prototype 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.590
 will now have to convince 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.939
 obviously nokia samsung apple 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.469
 to install her but maybe tomorrow 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.350
 we will have this and then now I am 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.500
 always wet 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.580
 we see it even more this keyboard 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.720
 I just wanted to show it to you because 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.990
 it is very beautiful it is a keyboard 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.580
 computer but who actually mixes 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.900
 hyper design is very very beautiful 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.370
 no real keys suck him the same 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 it's a plastic film and under the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.460
 keyboard you're going to have a little 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 camera system that will spot on 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.270
 what key are you typing and who is going 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.960
 give the indications on the screen 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.010
 computer 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.150
 that's what I just wanted you 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.620
 show because he is very very handsome 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.820
 and that this may be what we will 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.870
 will have tomorrow for his computer 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.610
 and all that can be in the trade 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.140
 just then the last laces of the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.760
 prototypes the first the projected keyboard 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.170
 already exists in the trade and it costs 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.930
 about 150 euros on the sites 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.440
 specialized 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.440
