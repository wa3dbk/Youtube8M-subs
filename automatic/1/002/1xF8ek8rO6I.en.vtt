00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
us a direct look at your brain so we can

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720

psychiatric illness so for example a DD
does<00:05:45.020> not<00:05:45.290> look<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.590> same<00:05:45.770> on<00:05:46.190> spec<00:05:46.550> for

does not look the same on spec for

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.909 
does not look the same on spec for
everyone<00:05:47.150> or<00:05:47.330> depression<00:05:47.900> does<00:05:48.050> not<00:05:48.260> look<00:05:48.680> the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
everyone or depression does not look the

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.090 
everyone or depression does not look the

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
same on a SPECT scan for everyone but

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.610 
same on a SPECT scan for everyone but
you<00:05:52.160> know<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.610> is<00:05:52.820> precisely<00:05:53.479> the<00:05:53.750> reason<00:05:53.960> to

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
you know that is precisely the reason to

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.550 
you know that is precisely the reason to
order<00:05:54.830> scans<00:05:55.460> and<00:05:55.760> individual<00:05:56.419> patients<00:05:57.080> it's

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
order scans and individual patients it's

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.510 
order scans and individual patients it's
useful<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.310> know<00:05:58.729> in<00:05:59.270> your<00:06:00.080> situation<00:06:00.520> how

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
useful to know in your situation how

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.150 
useful to know in your situation how
your<00:06:02.210> specific<00:06:02.479> brain<00:06:03.110> works<00:06:03.440> so<00:06:03.710> we<00:06:04.130> can

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
your specific brain works so we can

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.450 
your specific brain works so we can

category<00:06:07.940> like<00:06:08.210> depression<00:06:09.200> but<00:06:09.650> what<00:06:10.370> is

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
category like depression but what is

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.580 
category like depression but what is
your<00:06:10.669> brain<00:06:11.090> look<00:06:11.390> like<00:06:11.600> does<00:06:12.020> your<00:06:12.290> brain

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
your brain look like does your brain

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.000 
your brain look like does your brain
work<00:06:13.070> too<00:06:13.550> hard<00:06:13.820> does<00:06:14.450> your<00:06:14.780> brain<00:06:15.080> not<00:06:15.590> work

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
work too hard does your brain not work

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.659 
work too hard does your brain not work
