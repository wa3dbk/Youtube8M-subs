00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.480 
course your items just in case something
goes<00:01:56.030> wrong<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.630> map<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:59.770> again<00:02:00.770> all<00:02:01.189> this

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
goes wrong in the map and again all this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.690 
goes wrong in the map and again all this
can<00:02:01.789> be<00:02:01.820> found<00:02:01.969> behind<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:02.929> wall<00:02:03.170> at<00:02:03.409> spawn

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.250 

so<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.909> map<00:02:08.060> itself<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.950> map<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.720> spent<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.870> lot

coop<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.320> play<00:03:27.530> with<00:03:27.739> friends<00:03:29.200> now

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
coop and if you play with friends now

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.350 
coop and if you play with friends now
that<00:03:30.410> really<00:03:30.950> about<00:03:31.130> sums<00:03:31.640> up<00:03:31.880> what<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.090> wanted

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
that really about sums up what I wanted

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.470 
that really about sums up what I wanted
to<00:03:32.480> talk<00:03:32.690> about<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:33.170> map<00:03:33.489> all<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.790> rules<00:03:35.090> and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
to talk about this map all the rules and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.420

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
beginning of this map so there's

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.140
