 this is also the reason for the vote of 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.430
 free relationships with each of them 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.340
 expense instead earns a contribution 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.590
 important look in the planet's voice of the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 your life totally is not in fact a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.039
 in the event that this is the subtitle of this 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.509
 book and that is the revolution in the kitchen 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.939
 when we are not transformed 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.710
 from consumers to consumers not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.989
 we can really make the biggest one 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 of the parts therefore our one of 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.739
 consumer often says but what do you want 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.399
 that can change if I change to do 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.960
 shopping for groceries and an act 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.969
 political is an extremely serious act 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.429
 militancy but in the most beautiful sense 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.469
 of the term is a compassionate act a 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.059
 other that can allows 12 billion 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.339
 exactly twice as many people 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.339
 we are now able to eat because the 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.379
 problem is the Amazon forest has been 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.539
 deforested to make room for crops 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.100
 of cereals not for human use and not there 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.170
 would be the largest for 12 billion e 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.699
 people but the use of cattle that we will go 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.170
 to eat us therefore whenever 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.610
 we do the shopping 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.110
 we are the first generation of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.729
 adults who lost the idea of ​​the supply chain 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 food my mother would never have 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.210
 served tomatoes on the table of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.520
 Christmas would wait for the beauty 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.280
 season has never call you 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.789
 analyzed we have said throw it all away 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.439
 the year 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.670
 we have lost the relationship with the 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.899
 earth with healthy products then to 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.630
 moment when we regain our possession 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.549
 of sociality already changes very much the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.200
 my dream that we all become vegans but 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.850
 actually the most important thing for me 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.920
 is that cir acquires an awareness 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.899
 of food because the moment we 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.039
 we become aware of where you are 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.039
 let's eat can do 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:07.540
