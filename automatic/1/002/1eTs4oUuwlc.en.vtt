you can attach three different things if
you<00:04:21.070> need<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.430> do<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.870> will<00:04:23.410> be

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
you need to do so and that will be

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.920 
you need to do so and that will be
touched<00:04:23.890> from<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.490> crane<00:04:24.760> which<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.540> just<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
touched from the crane which is just a

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.680 
touched from the crane which is just a
hook<00:04:26.260> underneath<00:04:27.040> which<00:04:27.370> will<00:04:27.550> attach<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
hook underneath which will attach to the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.090 
hook underneath which will attach to the
top<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:29.200> we<00:04:29.290> have<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.590> landing<00:04:29.890> gear

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
top of there we have the landing gear

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.640 
top of there we have the landing gear
which<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.120> ski<00:04:31.600> style<00:04:31.990> landing<00:04:32.500> gear

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
which is the ski style landing gear

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.040 
which is the ski style landing gear
because<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.130> does<00:04:33.340> have<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.729> land<00:04:34.419> on<00:04:34.630> snow

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
because this does have to land on snow
