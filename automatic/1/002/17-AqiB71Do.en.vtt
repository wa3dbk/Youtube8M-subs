stacks<00:03:41.510> at<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.750> moment<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.829> have<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.280> say

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
stacks at the moment and I have to say

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.160 
stacks at the moment and I have to say
I'm<00:03:43.549> enjoying<00:03:43.849> it<00:03:43.940> quite<00:03:44.150> well<00:03:44.329> my<00:03:44.569> heels<00:03:44.810> do

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'm enjoying it quite well my heels do

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.190 
I'm enjoying it quite well my heels do
hit<00:03:45.769> for<00:03:46.099> quite<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.700> bit<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:47.810> my<00:03:48.079> only

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
hit for quite a bit but my only

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.839 
hit for quite a bit but my only
complaint<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.620> course<00:03:48.859> is<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.190> do<00:03:49.310> go<00:03:49.430> out

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
complaint of course is that I do go out

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.970 
complaint of course is that I do go out
of<00:03:50.150> mana<00:03:50.450> sometimes<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.290> when<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:51.950> happens

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
of mana sometimes and when that happens

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.309 
of mana sometimes and when that happens
that<00:03:52.519> pretty<00:03:52.849> much<00:03:53.000> felt<00:03:53.329> struggle<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.290> I

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
that pretty much felt struggle so I

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.920 
that pretty much felt struggle so I
really<00:03:55.280> prefer<00:03:55.430> quick<00:03:56.239> fights<00:03:56.569> but<00:03:56.810> that

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
really prefer quick fights but that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.890 
really prefer quick fights but that
usually<00:03:57.079> isn't<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.680> case<00:03:57.889> because<00:03:58.669> in<00:03:58.900> 1920

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
usually isn't the case because in 1920

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.599 
usually isn't the case because in 1920
Nina's<00:04:00.470> usually<00:04:00.950> want<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> healer

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
Nina's usually want to have a healer

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.490 
Nina's usually want to have a healer
with<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.150> pretty<00:04:02.599> much<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:03.049> what

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
with you and that pretty much is what

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.559 
with you and that pretty much is what
the<00:04:03.590> situation<00:04:03.889> is<00:04:04.250> eighty<00:04:04.910> percent<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.450> the

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
the situation is eighty percent of the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.170 
the situation is eighty percent of the
time<00:04:05.769> sometimes<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:07.010> get<00:04:07.130> dual<00:04:07.340> DPS<00:04:07.700> classes

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
time sometimes you get dual DPS classes

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.479 
time sometimes you get dual DPS classes
but<00:04:08.389> when<00:04:08.900> we<00:04:09.019> do<00:04:09.169> we<00:04:09.410> pretty<00:04:09.590> much<00:04:09.680> have<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.069> lot

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
but when we do we pretty much have a lot

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.809 
but when we do we pretty much have a lot
of<00:04:10.519> fun<00:04:10.790> taken<00:04:11.090> them<00:04:11.239> down<00:04:11.680> if<00:04:12.680> becoming<00:04:13.639> oom

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
of fun taken them down if becoming oom

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.170 
of fun taken them down if becoming oom
becomes<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.660> problem<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:15.980> future

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
becomes a problem in the future

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.009 
becomes a problem in the future
consistently<00:04:17.180> then<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.599> will<00:04:17.810> definitely

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
consistently then I will definitely

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.589 
consistently then I will definitely
change<00:04:18.530> up<00:04:18.769> my<00:04:18.889> 30<00:04:19.130> spell<00:04:19.370> power<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.729> chant<00:04:19.970> to
