00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.950
 very good there is a tragic news that 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.320
 are giving the whole world 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.020
 could say and is that whatsapp has left 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.510
 to work and this may be due to 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.670
 that has recently been acquired by 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.529
 the facebook company and is giving 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.289
 some mistakes some can see some 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.179
 images not in which when 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.970
 comentéis por whatsapp things of the typical 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:28.480
 little watch that is loading a message 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.220
 and never upload the news to you because the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.079
 instant messaging application 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.270
 multiplatform newly acquired by 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.930
 facebook is having problems with your 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.059
 servers 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.920
 although they have not yet spoken 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.500
 respect through the social network 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.050
 'twitter' of your whatsapp user is 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.000
 manifesting the same fault that is 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.710
 but equally affecting all the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.690
 messages we send are not received and 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.059
 they go and likewise we do not receive 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.370
 no type of message without notification 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.350
 the last time whatsapp communicated 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.850
 officially problems of this type with 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.310
 your instant messaging service 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.290
 last day was December 7, 2007 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.080
 here no longer having to two things first 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 is that whatsapp has the same problem 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.830
 that even though this service 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 messaging is so and is extended to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.340
 global level as whatsapp continues 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.130
 having problems sometimes with their 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.520
 servers not good this the truth is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.940
 that you do not know when it's going to be fixed 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.860
 the same is arranged within a minute 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.080
 that the same thing within a week does not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 I think it's so much but let's go I think 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 to do what to do with what is I think 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.510
 that will have to be fixed fast already 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.580
 that many people depend on this 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.460
 and I do not think they can leave it that way 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.140
 time because I think more than one 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.710
 it would be the heads without whatsapp of that 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 there is a certain addiction to it but 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.760
 Well, I hope that the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010
 platform as soon as possible that 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.440
 fix the servers and that works 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.810
 everything perfectly good I leave you here 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 Chávez I hope you liked the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.310
 video if the line has not been reported 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.110
 because the truth helps a lot 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.930
 otherwise you can subscribe that 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.930
 it also helps a lot bye bye
