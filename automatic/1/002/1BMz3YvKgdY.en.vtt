00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.160
 beneficial properties that the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.340
 ingredients that make up this water 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.769
 It is composed of orange lemon and pineapple 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.659
 we give abortion rich to the water that already 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.999
 there is no excuse to drink us the amount 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:27.029
 recommended daily subscribe to my channel 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.039
 and find me on social networks is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 great because we're going to need a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.780
 lemon an orange a pineapple water well 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 cold and a wide neck bottle for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
 that fits the pieces of fruit both at 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.129
 lemon like orange we are going to leave you 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.449
 the shell but we removed the nuggets 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.550
 we cut a few slices and 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.530
 We reserve to fit better to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.019
 through the neck of the bottle is better 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 that we cut them in half and the pineapple 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.420
 if we are going to peel it, we cut slices and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.399
 We divide into quarters once the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 We are going to put fruit in the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.290
 empty bottle I have chosen this order 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 so that it is more showy but as 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.440
 you already know the order of the factors not 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.690
 alter the product 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.850
 so that the water accepts the properties and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.440
 the flavor of the fruit we must leave 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.930
 macerate about three hours 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.730
 approximately and also better if 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 we make in the refrigerator so that 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.750
 be cool and in summer we 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 it's easier to drink once 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.980
 we have all the fruit we are going to fill 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 what's left with water like you are 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.990
 seeing and we have our water ready 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.610
 of all that you think this idea I think 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.040
 that it was for summer comes in handy 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.930
 to take care of ourselves inside and out 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.090
