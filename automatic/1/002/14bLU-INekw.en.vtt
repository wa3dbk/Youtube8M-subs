00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 today we meet for us 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
 very particular a very epic place 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.330
 video what the fuck since we are going to troll 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.680
 legend is going to dump the general's cat and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.000
 it works also for the clan cat 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.779
 so that already you do a little 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.490
 demonstration 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.349
 here you see that everyone is talking 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 in the general and we're just going 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.870
 emptied the clan cat so the guy like 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.879
 it's tac tac I'm doing that and boom I'm aiming for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.739
 leader of the clan ben here we take people 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.760
 the we will see that what say 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 people 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 we will see what how 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.340
 react people simply 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 and then I will explain 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 how to simply do this 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 little troll this little bug here are people 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.820
 how do you do that actually they have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.829
 not understand that it was a hold title 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.890
 explain to you how you see there so 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.890
 I am a hacker 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.689
 we will type that and then I will 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.610
 remake 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.600
 so there he understood how when he 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.770
 wants how I was doing where 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.210
 unfortunately this is something that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 dictated a little bit known right now who 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.490
 which is not that much anymore 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 everyone knows but here is everything 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.700
 case he does not know and so we're going 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 continue to the troll is a little bit 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
 hop there boom heart cat 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 so that's actually what am I doing 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.259
 it's simply 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.090
 I copied glued something a good 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.770
 application and I put several 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 spaces then obviously like you 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.659
 can see here I put a little point 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.520
 they go out of bounds and the end so 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 he too understood how he was doing 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.049
 that's actually it's really 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.800
 very simple thing to do but we do not 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.650
 do not delete the cat 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.240
 general we are doing here we do not 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.390
 do not know we do not remove the head of the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.980
 general we simply do a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.700
 space that makes you no longer see the 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.640
 previous messages 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.080
 but if we go down we see them again we see 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 what has been written previously 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.390
 so in fact it's pretty funny to do 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.460
 so it's pretty epic 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.020
 so now I want to explain so 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.340
 here stop talking for nothing 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.780
 I will explain how to do it 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.320
 so we end up on the screen 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.150
 Home 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.890
 and what is he going to need so he goes 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.440
 you need it's your little application 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.390
 here that is clipping so this little 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.490
 clip application will allow you to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.000
 copy paste things to anyone 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.770
 what moment 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.840
 so it's just going to take you 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.140
 put it in louis throws in the bar of 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.670
 notifications like this I kids you 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.940
 still do not jailbreak 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 to make this little bug this little troll 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.730
 So, but how does it sound like that? 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.250
 is called a widget in the bar of 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 notification and then we go into the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.530
 scratch pad 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.410
 so we can simply write everything 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.270
 what we want since the title there to 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.330
 writing 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.190
 it does not mean anything 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 so once we have the scriptures and 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.480
 here I was looking for keyboard to wear 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.170
 hands here we go down do we write this 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.630
 that you want and we go down and we do 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.239
 50 spaces like these have made 50 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.940
 spaces and we know we put a little point 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.489
 in the end for unlimited power all 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.440
 just here the end here we can 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.000
 really but a pea here for 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.040
 delimit the end and we do well 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.270
 obviously 50 spaces I repeat myself but 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.090
 because it's very important if you 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.810
 do it 51 it will not work 49 is not 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.300
 not 51 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.060
 so here and then once you have 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.080
 that you go in the settings you 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.660
 so do general you go in 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.010
 keyboard and a keyboard you all do 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.290
 the keyboards and you add the keyboard 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.239
 clipse you have to buy the clip 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.390
 you press you make allow 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.950
 full access and so here's once 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.990
 I heard luigi happen to you have you 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.750
 selected everything in the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.430
 in the notepad it's at this 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.930
 technical ocean walking on android 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.610
 it prepared me without similar training 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.530
 I will do it on ipad because more 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.080
 in addition to partitions on ipad in point 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.730
 on ios but it also works on those 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.260
 rando raid copy you short we're going 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.840
 stop saying anything to talk 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.880
 to say anything here you copy ah yes 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.800
 it did not work because it's 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.130
 why pop have deleted 1 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.490
 we select not everything we copy 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.460
 glue 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.130
 so here's a copy and then there he goes 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.830
 say where the new new things Coptic 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.320
 you can add it you can the 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.240
 put in the clip that you make to 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.250
 little more than that boom and he adds 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.550
 then so you go in flank clash 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.320
 So we'll let go of the plan like these are 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.080
 not necessarily restarted just on the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.930
 company is present as it restarts 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.580
 the game and once you are 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.620
 to taint plan you go in the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.900
 general that's it and you press the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.190
 little planet who is here a family 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.500
 also knew planet here you have 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.090
 all your cat customers will in any case 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.610
 your thing with you your career 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.080
 your message you want you with 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.560
 which role you have and the general 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.300
 quite simply 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.460
 here's the second because it's the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.030
 only who has 50 spaces so here you are 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.390
 do text up and that's it removes the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.160
 cat 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.470
 finally it troll people so that's it 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.600

 jailbreak for the green it works 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 also on android and on ios it works 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.770
 all platforms but that's enough 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.090
