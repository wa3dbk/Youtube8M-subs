00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 We're going to work at a meniscus. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.270
 It was with him that you can create any 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.239
 thing garments as much as clothing 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.720
 bed linen carpets and the like 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.080
 you can use line and supreme leftovers 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:06.900
 in novel acrylic yarn leftovers 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 and leftover acrylic yarn with the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 The central part of our piece can 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.550
 be done using the small works that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 you have 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.670
 how small is any 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.700
 little you have to do 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.040
 a large amount of the casters 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.410
 union you will make using only one in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.560
 body 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.560
 The tip is you use the separation of the wires 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 any separation whatsoever which 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.390
 you have the same thread the larger part the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.869
 movie you have in greater quantity 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.100
 You will leave to make the meetings and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.570
 a finish around the piece 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.670
 We can also use string 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.020
 francisco multicores for the part 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.890
 center of our piece with the union made 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.450
 in raw string to use acrylic yarn 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.830
 We're going to work with needle with love. 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 love three points 75mm 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.420
 This mini motif we are going to start is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.980
 a cooler today 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:17.430
 so we'll do a two three 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.950
 four five chains introduce 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.110
 needles in the first chain made and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.920
 close with a low point do a two 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.390
 three chains needle loop inside the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 formed a high point or your 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.340
 needle a high point 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.930
 Here we have three point one two 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.340
 loop chains within the same space a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.340
 high point 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.459
 23 high points 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:07.239
 watch two chains what I think 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.239
 within the same space a high point 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.260
 two points high three points high 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:26.209
 two chains 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:28.780
 I find in the same place a point 23 points 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.780
 high 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.700
 one contained a two currents in the two 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.180
 third current first point all 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.569
 needle and closes with the lowest point 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.180
 we then have four groups with three 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:52.519
 high points in each 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.099
 separated by two chains made this 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.160
 we'll pull a little pass 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:03.919
 needle inside that way let's 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.370
 pull the cut piece is made 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:11.359
 just finish the piece you will catch 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:18.289
 one upholsterer needle we pass 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:20.859
 end up casting the wrong side of the 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.930
 Wire Tip 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.289
 now you are a facilitator at the time of 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.460
 hide the line from the line you go 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:34.240
 to do all the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:40.450
 reasons that you do hiding right in the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:45.130
 between the points and cut the net 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:50.500
 The current cutter contained this 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:56.080
 the beginning tip is also ready 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.570
 the first part of our play that is 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.450
 today here is our first reason you 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:05.280
 will work several texts for us 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.280
 join together
