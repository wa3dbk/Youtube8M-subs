this kind of gets it straight but not

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.549 
this kind of gets it straight but not
too<00:00:34.960> straight

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
too straight

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.850 
too straight
so<00:00:36.340> I'll<00:00:36.460> just<00:00:36.580> rush<00:00:37.000> through<00:00:37.330> my<00:00:37.690> hair<00:00:37.989> so

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
so I'll just rush through my hair so

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.500 
so I'll just rush through my hair so
your<00:00:38.920> hair<00:00:38.980> will<00:00:39.250> look<00:00:39.280> kind<00:00:39.700> of<00:00:39.790> frizzy<00:00:40.270> and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
your hair will look kind of frizzy and

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.430

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840 

but<00:00:47.440> if<00:00:47.559> I'm<00:00:47.680> using<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:48.040> one-inch<00:00:48.309> curling<00:00:48.489> rod

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
so if you don't have one just use a

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.049 
so if you don't have one just use a
small<00:00:50.860> curling<00:00:51.190> iron<00:00:51.400> at<00:00:51.519> home<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:51.940> don't

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
and then I pull on it to kind of loosen

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.469 
and then I pull on it to kind of loosen
the<00:01:15.100> curls<00:01:15.370> so<00:01:15.520> they're<00:01:15.670> not<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:16.000> tight<00:01:16.240> and

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
the curls so they're not so tight and

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.800 
the curls so they're not so tight and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
then for the next piece I curl it in the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.630 
then for the next piece I curl it in the
opposite<00:01:20.230> direction<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.890> first<00:01:21.100> one<00:01:21.430> so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
opposite direction of the first one so

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.590 
opposite direction of the first one so
they<00:01:22.270> don't<00:01:22.450> all<00:01:22.600> go<00:01:22.750> in<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.900> same<00:01:22.990> direction

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
they don't all go in the same direction

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.870 
they don't all go in the same direction
again<00:01:25.600> leaving<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.900> ends<00:01:26.110> straight<00:01:26.730> and<00:01:27.730> when

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880

what<00:01:41.260> we're<00:01:41.410> doing<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:41.920> curling<00:01:42.310> one<00:01:43.300> piece

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
what we're doing is curling one piece

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.140 
what we're doing is curling one piece
going<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.260> way<00:01:44.470> backwards<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.880> next

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
going this way backwards and the next

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.240 
going this way backwards and the next
piece<00:01:46.300> going<00:01:46.900> forward<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:47.620> it's<00:01:47.740> all<00:01:47.920> kind<00:01:48.190> of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
piece going forward so it's all kind of
