00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.799
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.849
 here in my hands they brought me here a 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.240
 roasted oven of the brand oster este 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.240
 it's the model 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.370
 this is the model and this is the problem that 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.360
 have 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:29.190
 this roasted oven is that it 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.490
 turn on I have it here connected to the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.950
 and electric current 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.510
 and I'm going to show you that I have 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.230
 current 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.809
 there is current who he 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 in the in the plug 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.530
 we have current 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.890
 and it does not turn on then I will proceed to 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.900
 open it to see that in trouble 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.720
 I meet and share with you the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.640
 problem because maybe one day the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.640
 problem that I have today in this 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.750
 roasted oven maybe that problem what 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.900
 can you someday have this 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.390
 oven seems to be digital then what 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.810
 I'm going to uncover to start doing 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.810
 some tests 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.039
 ok friends then from here and uncover 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.039
 I uncovered the toaster oven 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:40.450
 the first step to follow should always be 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.450
 find the thermal fuse that you have 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.479
 here we have what is the card 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.430
 electronics has three relays 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.830
 some capacitors some resistors 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.830
 two three-legged transistors 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.060
 here here I found what is possible 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.440
 thermal 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.160
 I do not know if I'm going to do it 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 approach in this part of here is 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.950
 the thermal fuse for me is always the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.930
 first objective to review in any 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 electronic device whatever the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.010
 possible 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.760
 regularly 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.629
 in the in ovens and heaters in 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.629
 in the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.620
 this portable heaters or in these 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.210
 ovens 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.550
 roasted or in rice cookers 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.250
 regularly always in what is damaged 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.450
 many times is the possible 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.820
 thermal then what I'm going to do 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.800
 Now I'm going to remove this fuse 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.140
 thermal to review it and I'll tell you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 if it is the problem or not 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 the step to follow here is going to be cut 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.060
 very carefully the clamps that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.060
 they have cables in their place 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.430
 the next thing is going to be 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.560
 and follow the line of the fuse cable 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.230
 that is here connected to the card 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.040
 electronic which we are going to try to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.040
 disconnect 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.620
 of removing a protective plastic towards 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 behind 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.180
 he's pretty hard he does not want to leave 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 in the cane terminal it is possible that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 have insurance then I'm going to look for something 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.750
 to be able to remove it 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.000
 to remove the cable from the fuse 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.159
 you must also remove this cable and already 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 I have marked and also the 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.940
 photography for the time to connect not 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.700
 wrong because if I'm wrong I'll 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.520
 causes problems to the electronic card 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.739
 to remove this many times 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.819
 in order to remove the terminals 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.260
 It requires 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.919
 a clip 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.910
 or a screwdriver with needle stitch already 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.130
 who have insurance 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.710
 you have to chop where the safety is 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.710
 so they can leave 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.080
 or more 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.580
 now yes I have the freedom 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.729
 of power this remove this fuse 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.749
 thermal that is attached to a clamp 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.749
 Now I must 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.230
 I have to 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.230
 unfold a small insurance 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.720
 the wind 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.920
 I do not know if you look 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.070
 here where he was caught is going to be a 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.070
 close up 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.530
 is that the part where he was held 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.530
 the possible thermal 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.710
 now we are going to cut the cable here 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.720
 to do a test 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.300
 Well, I have here in my hands already 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:51.760
 which is the possible thermal which was 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.810
 covered with this bandage 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.290
 and then effectively the thermal fuse 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.290
 it's bad 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.040
 this thermal fuse has already a little 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.510
 deleted his description which I'm going to 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.690
 try to see if I can look at it with a 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.690
 magnifying glass
