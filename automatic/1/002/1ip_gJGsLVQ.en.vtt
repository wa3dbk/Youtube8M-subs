00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.450
 hello to all and all these stefan 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 twitter but today we find ourselves 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.900
 in the company of janis dead for a 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.580
 new glitch on bootleg i 'm just going 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.700
 put in the general melee I can 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.620
 why I put it so it's the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.200
 same principle as the glitch of the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.000
 last time by whatever I do not know 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.220
 if they are invincible or not the radars 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.370
 portable and all read I would say 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:58.620
 still on arrival and firm there he 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:01.450
 told me we'll see john murray ok then 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.770
 so you take a class the weapons 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.000
 you do not mind it's a 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.200
 class like that with for example as well 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.610
 only to you portable radars 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.060
 you know where to go to talk in the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.660
 garage and then here I discovered it all 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.920
 only yesterday 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.649
 attention not virgin black because I 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.509
 tried to undo it in fact if we can 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.530
 destroy it 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.950
 yeah but it's still a good 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.830
 hide it yeah that's that the guy the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.789
 see what and so yeah bah it takes 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.810
 that they have a relationship there is no 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.280
 a lot of people playing with 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.590
 report yeah so that's it so we 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.130

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.080
