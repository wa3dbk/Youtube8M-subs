00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.439
 So today I would like to have text animation using presets of piste 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.310
 I think 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:13.750
 It's a text preset but it should be fine for after effects 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:16.170
 Please try using it by all means 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.170
 Please 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:30.640
 I 'm feeling the brain Today is using the text preset 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:36.430
 Well I want to make a text animation like this 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.280
 There is a lot of work with text presets, but how to apply them 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.420
 I think I want to do it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.440
 I was making a skylight text 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.840
 So I have this animation preset but I will open it there 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.390
 When 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:57.280
 It is raised and opens the Tteyuu back support is I think that has become something like 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.040
 Over there to open me this turn off and is in the folder that say pre-set in the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 To give 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:08.409
 There are so many different things, for example 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.080
 Leave there I nest presto guy Art in the animation and the members but is on the top 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.090
 It is such a feeling when we first arrive 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:24.570
 Guest animation will be made automatically, so it's a fake preset 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.040
 However, it is a viewpoint of this list, but if it is hard to try one by one if it goes well 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.960
 It has the Tteyuu animation presets win of a place called the animation 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.010
 Click it but is 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.230
 Hmm 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 In this way, adobe's Blick starts up 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.570
 I also say that this is a baby 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.960
 I have to download at first, but from adobe's official site 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:55.280

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:58.580
 Because here has been to free it, including the prefectures is try to put Do Iddde in the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.210
 I have a folder along 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:09.470
 It feels like this when I open it 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:13.930
 A list of the previous folders will be displayed and you can open it and add more 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.180
