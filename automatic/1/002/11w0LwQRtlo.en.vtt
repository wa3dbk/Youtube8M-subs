00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
today so you know I guess they're okay

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.789 
today so you know I guess they're okay
it's<00:01:14.369> bright<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> UM<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it's bright you know just have to UM I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
it's bright you know just have to UM I
just<00:01:17.460> moved<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.939> table<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
just moved to this table so I don't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
just moved to this table so I don't
really<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.259> lot<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.369> we'll<00:01:20.580> just

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
really know a lot about it so we'll just

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.920 
really know a lot about it so we'll just
have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.600> table<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
have to see and I think this table is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
have to see and I think this table is
breaking<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:23.220> tables<00:01:23.580> anyways<00:01:23.939> okay

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
breaking into two tables anyways okay

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
breaking into two tables anyways okay
and<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.530> obviously<00:01:25.950> limit<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> your<00:01:26.549> game<00:01:26.759> your

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and so obviously limit to your game your

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
and so obviously limit to your game your
last<00:01:27.299> bracelet<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> World<00:01:28.409> Series<00:01:28.470> was

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
last bracelet for the World Series was

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.890 
last bracelet for the World Series was
in<00:01:29.130> limit<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.210> you've<00:01:30.479> even<00:01:30.570> written<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
in limit and you've even written a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260 
in limit and you've even written a
chapter<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.740> book<00:01:31.880> teaching<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> feel
