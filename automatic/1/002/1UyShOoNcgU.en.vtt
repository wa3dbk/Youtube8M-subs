however that takes a lot of different
dvds<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.550> never<00:01:41.819> efficient<00:01:43.069> best<00:01:44.069> if<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
dvds and is never efficient best if you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.570 
dvds and is never efficient best if you
get<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.959> USB<00:01:45.959> Drive<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.410> something<00:01:47.280> else<00:01:47.459> that

you could upload your image to in this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.380 
you could upload your image to in this
case<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.360> lucky<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:53.119> another<00:01:54.119> one

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
case I'm lucky to have a another one

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.350 
case I'm lucky to have a another one
terabyte<00:01:54.750> drive<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.910> it's<00:01:56.910> still<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
terabyte drive and it's still going to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
terabyte drive and it's still going to
ask<00:01:57.539> me<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:57.780> recreate<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.440> CD<00:01:59.009> once<00:01:59.369> I'm

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
ask me to recreate a CD once I'm

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.150 
ask me to recreate a CD once I'm
finished<00:01:59.819> so<00:02:00.479> let's<00:02:00.690> click<00:02:01.080> on<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.530> f<00:02:01.979> drive

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
finished so let's click on the f drive

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.020 
finished so let's click on the f drive
as<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:03.289> secondary<00:02:04.289> drive<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.950> hit<00:02:05.429> next<00:02:08.030> okay

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
as my secondary drive and hit next okay

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.930 
as my secondary drive and hit next okay
so<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.020> following<00:02:10.319> will<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.340> backed<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so the following will be backed up to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.830 
so the following will be backed up to
the<00:02:11.970> f<00:02:12.180> drive<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:13.440> your<00:02:13.530> drive

it's ready then it's going to ask for a
DVD<00:02:36.349> or<00:02:36.379> CD<00:02:36.860> in<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.489> system<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:39.379> would

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
DVD or CD in the system and that would

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.180 
DVD or CD in the system and that would
be<00:02:40.370> your<00:02:40.610> Buddha<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:42.590> boot<00:02:42.769> up<00:02:42.799> and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
be your Buddha so it will boot up and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.050 
be your Buddha so it will boot up and
look<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.690> dis<00:02:45.140> recovering<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.739> ever<00:02:46.069> need

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
look for a dis recovering we ever need

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.520 
look for a dis recovering we ever need
to<00:02:47.209> restore<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.480> make<00:02:50.630> sure<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.959> label<00:02:51.230> that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
to restore so make sure you label that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.050 
to restore so make sure you label that
correctly<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:52.579> not<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.910> take<00:02:53.030> a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
correctly and it's not going to take a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.410 
correctly and it's not going to take a
lot<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:54.280> space<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.670> packin<00:02:56.060> up<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.390> a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
lot of space if you packin up to a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.039 
lot of space if you packin up to a
physical<00:02:57.140> track<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:59.120> best<00:02:59.329> thing<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.569> do<00:02:59.780> I

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
physical track so the best thing to do I

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.210 
physical track so the best thing to do I
suggest<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.640> only<00:03:01.790> have<00:03:02.629> a<00:03:02.890> file<00:03:03.890> recovery

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
suggest is not only have a file recovery

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.979 
suggest is not only have a file recovery
setup<00:03:05.060> also<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.709> raid<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:08.329> know<00:03:08.450> set<00:03:08.720> up<00:03:08.840> a

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
setup also is to raid you know set up a

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.190 
setup also is to raid you know set up a
wave<00:03:09.290> nearing<00:03:09.769> rate<00:03:10.640> one<00:03:10.970> at<00:03:11.269> least<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.110> you

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
wave nearing rate one at least so you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.860 
wave nearing rate one at least so you
come<00:03:12.349> near<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.920> disc<00:03:13.549> I'm<00:03:14.360> sure<00:03:14.629> there's<00:03:14.840> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
come near the disc I'm sure there's a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.150 
come near the disc I'm sure there's a
lot<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.019> other<00:03:15.230> videos<00:03:15.590> on<00:03:15.769> YouTube<00:03:16.129> that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
lot of other videos on YouTube that

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.400 
lot of other videos on YouTube that
tells<00:03:16.519> how<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.940> do<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.360> but<00:03:17.840> basically<00:03:18.079> what

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
tells how to do that but basically what

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.199 
tells how to do that but basically what
you<00:03:18.560> need<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:18.950> actually<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.370> raid<00:03:19.549> driver<00:03:19.819> and

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
you need is actually the raid driver and

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.110 
you need is actually the raid driver and
your<00:03:20.389> virus<00:03:20.780> has<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.170> support<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.760> bowels

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
your virus has to support it the bowels

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.610 
your virus has to support it the bowels
is<00:03:23.389> definitely<00:03:24.079> part<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.590> your<00:03:26.319> system<00:03:27.319> so<00:03:27.500> you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
is definitely part of your system so you

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.379 
is definitely part of your system so you
know<00:03:27.829> different<00:03:28.040> vendors<00:03:28.519> use<00:03:28.790> different<00:03:29.150> bio

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
know different vendors use different bio

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.140 
know different vendors use different bio
so<00:03:29.750> I'm<00:03:30.650> not<00:03:30.950> going<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.130> go<00:03:31.280> down<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.549> def<00:03:31.849> into

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
so I'm not going to go down and def into

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.120 
so I'm not going to go down and def into
it<00:03:32.299> but<00:03:32.690> at<00:03:32.840> least<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.170> gives<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.530> idea<00:03:33.920> what

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
it but at least that gives you idea what

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.720 
it but at least that gives you idea what
to<00:03:34.250> look<00:03:34.370> for<00:03:35.019> ok<00:03:36.019> I'm<00:03:36.470> gonna<00:03:36.620> pick<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> up<00:03:37.370> in<00:03:37.579> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
to look for ok I'm gonna pick it up in a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.099 
to look for ok I'm gonna pick it up in a
few<00:03:37.940> seconds<00:03:38.739> why<00:03:39.739> now<00:03:39.920> looks<00:03:40.190> like<00:03:40.280> is

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
few seconds why now looks like is

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.460 
few seconds why now looks like is
