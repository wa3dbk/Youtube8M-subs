rails and it's really cool and all

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.899 
rails and it's really cool and all
you'll<00:00:50.140> need<00:00:50.229> is<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.760> things<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:51.879> my

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
you'll need is the things in my

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.549 
you'll need is the things in my
inventory<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:52.629> make<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.930> but<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.320> only<00:00:53.409> need

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
inventory to make it but you only need

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.219 
inventory to make it but you only need
one<00:00:53.830> powered<00:00:54.070> rail<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.430> start<00:00:54.640> out<00:00:54.760> with<00:00:55.229> so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
one powered rail to start out with so

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.869 
one powered rail to start out with so
how<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:56.530> make<00:00:56.739> this<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.159> that<00:00:57.309> you<00:00:57.400> put<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.610> block

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
how to make this is that you put a block

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.270 
how to make this is that you put a block
down<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.239> any<00:00:58.390> kind<00:00:58.690> put<00:00:59.440> three<00:00:59.650> torches<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.159> it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
down of any kind put three torches on it

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.079 
down of any kind put three torches on it
put<00:01:00.970> three<00:01:01.239> blocks<00:01:01.510> on<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.900> torches<00:01:02.909> put<00:01:03.909> two

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
put three blocks on the torches put two

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.870 
put three blocks on the torches put two
blocks<00:01:04.360> off<00:01:04.690> here<00:01:05.019> put<00:01:05.979> redstone<00:01:06.159> here<00:01:06.700> and

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
blocks off here put redstone here and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.270 
blocks off here put redstone here and
then<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.299> this<00:01:07.540> side<00:01:07.690> on<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.619> left<00:01:08.650> side<00:01:09.010> of<00:01:09.070> it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
then on this side on the left side of it

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.280 
then on this side on the left side of it
and<00:01:09.430> this<00:01:10.060> will<00:01:10.270> make<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.540> so<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.810> starts<00:01:11.170> going

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
and this will make it so it starts going

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.230 
and this will make it so it starts going
rapidly<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.369> off<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.760> that's<00:01:12.909> what<00:01:13.060> makes

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
rapidly on and off and that's what makes

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.510 
rapidly on and off and that's what makes
the<00:01:13.330> Pistons<00:01:13.720> go<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.140> off<00:01:14.260> so<00:01:15.250> you'll<00:01:15.400> put

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
the Pistons go on and off so you'll put

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.090 
the Pistons go on and off so you'll put
a<00:01:15.550> piston<00:01:15.880> on<00:01:16.000> there<00:01:16.240> put<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:16.870> lever<00:01:17.110> on<00:01:17.380> this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
a piston on there put a lever on this

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.150 
a piston on there put a lever on this
block<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:20.110> then<00:01:20.230> you<00:01:20.350> can<00:01:20.470> toggle<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:20.950> and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
block so then you can toggle it on and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.660 
block so then you can toggle it on and
off<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.990> from<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.350> right<00:01:24.340> off<00:01:24.550> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
off and then from that right off the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.060 
off and then from that right off the
side<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:24.910> this<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.330> go<00:01:25.480> one<00:01:25.750> two<00:01:26.140> three<00:01:26.860> and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
side of this you go one two three and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.150 
side of this you go one two three and
then<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:29.140> right<00:01:29.290> in<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.410> middle<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.680> put<00:01:29.950> one

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
then I'm right in the middle you put one

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.040 
then I'm right in the middle you put one
block<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.820> glass<00:01:31.300> block<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:31.900> another

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
block a glass block and then another

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.170 
block a glass block and then another
block<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.650> then<00:01:33.250> on<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.520> end<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:33.970> you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
block and then on the end of this you

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.260 
block and then on the end of this you
put<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.390> sticky<00:01:34.870> piston<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:36.490> under<00:01:36.910> this

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
put a sticky piston and then under this

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.230 
put a sticky piston and then under this
part<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.660> piston<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.050> put<00:01:38.230> a<00:01:38.260> block<00:01:39.240> put

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
part of the piston you put a block put

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.060 
part of the piston you put a block put
the<00:01:40.330> rescue<00:01:40.600> redstone<00:01:40.990> around<00:01:41.260> here<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:41.980> it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
the rescue redstone around here so it

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.210 
the rescue redstone around here so it
empowers<00:01:42.370> this<00:01:42.610> 33<00:01:43.390> rails<00:01:43.600> here<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.830> you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
empowers this 33 rails here and then you

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.720 
empowers this 33 rails here and then you
can<00:01:45.370> turn<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.450> on<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.190> then<00:01:48.190> hold<00:01:48.430> down<00:01:48.490> right

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
can turn it on and then hold down right

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.290 
can turn it on and then hold down right
click<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.010> can<00:01:51.130> see<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.370> got<00:01:51.760> tons<00:01:52.180> of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
click and as you can see I got tons of

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.020 
click and as you can see I got tons of
extra<00:01:52.600> wit<00:01:52.750> rails<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:54.310> doesn't<00:01:54.610> do<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.700> every

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
extra wit rails it doesn't do it every

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.870 
extra wit rails it doesn't do it every
single<00:01:55.210> time<00:01:55.620> which<00:01:56.620> kind<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:56.920> stinks<00:01:57.400> like<00:01:57.580> I

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
single time which kind of stinks like I

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.730 
single time which kind of stinks like I
had<00:01:58.330> seven<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.020> then<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.680> got<00:02:00.210> 11<00:02:01.210> x<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.600> mean<00:02:01.840> 11

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
had seven and then I got 11 x I mean 11

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.490 
had seven and then I got 11 x I mean 11
now<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.550> only<00:02:03.580> got<00:02:03.880> four<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.450> time<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.440> it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
now so only got four that time so it
