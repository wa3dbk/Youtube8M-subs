 Milanese chicken breast then 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.850

 chicken cut in milanesa and breadcrumbs 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.710
 let's boil our water in 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.750
 which we are going to consider our 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.310
 spaghetti and we're going to put a little 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.470
 olive oil 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.899
 extra virgin so you have much more 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.560
 taste a little salt salt always 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.560

 and we're going to leave it cooking for 12 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.170
 minutes and it's going to be the perfect time 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.010
 so that it is in its point to pass it to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.010
 the sauce 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.920

 because I want to finish cooking 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.520

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.720
 olive oil 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.720
 and I'm going to let it warm up a little bit 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.700
 let's stop a little butter 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.370

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.840

 and I will be putting a little 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.379
 high chopped so that it takes more flavor 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.379
 fried steamer 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 and before the tacos are put on 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.030
 I'm going to cook 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.030
 green pepper 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.170

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:11.580

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 who is choosing you can also serve 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.750
 very good for a vegetarian dish 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.610
 but for vegetarians if you take 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.639
 dairy because it is not carrying meat 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.020
 and we're going to let it cook fast as 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.849

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.389

 I can be saving our Milanese 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:25.539
 and putting a pinch of pepper 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.539

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.280

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.560

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.560
 and I 'm going to put a little garlic 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.850

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.870

 two minutes on each side and with that 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.670
 material because the Milanese mine is very 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.510
 thin and the chicken breast is 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.510
 very fast kitchen 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.889
 and it is already cooked by the other side and 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:22.520
 is hitting the chicken lens 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.900
 I'm going to leave it on the other side, almost 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.449

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.449
 and I have my breast ready to serve 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.809

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:37.039

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.830
 little bit of fresh cilantro on the 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.830

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.110
 and decorate with some lemons 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.559
 and here is my spaghetti already ready that does not 

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:59.689
