00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.189
 this first event I want to show a 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.140
 very big news to the market 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.270
 Latin American and unveil our 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.160
 new commentators fernando palomo 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.349
 mario that instead of siero proposes a 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.269
 team of three quality commentators 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.489
 proven accuracy in their 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.290
 excellent comments and that for the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.180
 feedback team is an addition 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.949
 extremely important and that we 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.659
 he's very excited because we believe 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.750
 that is going to be a big difference our 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.469
 public has really been first a 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.969
 surprise that has been chosen to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.039
 integrate this important group to 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.770
 the fifa braid really never me 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.070
 I imagined that I live to excite so much 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.220
 when you really have to live it 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.440
 without seeing anything on the court in the background but 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.140
 it went well there have been many hours of 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.020
 work but one does it with such pleasure 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 that in the end, one thing happens very fast 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.080
 is to see it and another thing is to try 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.640
 somehow put yourself in a situation 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.380
 that you think that shortly 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.300
 with a lot of people a lot of people are going to 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.470
 be listening to our voice I hope that 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.360
 everything I like because the truth can 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 be part of the biggest football club 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.770
 of the world 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.859
 from the first contact until 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.530
 what has now been the presentation 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.789
 surprised from the first moment 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.189
 grateful to the jay sports group 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.530
 for having taken us into account for thinking 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.659
 in us and that we can be 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.520
 vehicle to raise the quality of 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.689
 game that for me in particular is a 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.329
 Huge honor is a level of anxiety 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.950
 great also for knowing the 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.770
 result of working hours and of 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.299
 integration of the game with our voices 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 so I think there are still steps 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.119
 for giving in this process but it has been a 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.579
 unique experience wanting to repeat it 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.810
 It has also been wonderful, I can help you 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.610
 say what 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.290
 a curiosity is presented I said 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.300
 a lot of times and I do not feel sorry 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.010
 me my first game of first narration 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.090
 game in front of a video game before 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 a video console without a doubt and it's what 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.530
 organize my own tournaments that 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.349
 it was part of me of my illness to be 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.360
 sports commentator took me to that 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.610
 my first stories were in front of a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 video console and good now that it 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.420
 presents that advances the technology and that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.430
 will be this resource to include 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.680
 narration comments and reporter's 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.040
 court can be in this mix me 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 love 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.959
 with gerardo torrado 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.900
 9 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.150
 If i were 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.040
 good 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.410
 I have enough danger 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.930
 every day 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.930
 burdisso has to escape 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.340
 the wonder of marquez 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.420
 all right 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.430
 a little bit late 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.430
 ahead 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.500
 in exchange we are doing and you change 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 parts of all evolution we had 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.620
 seven years working with pleasure and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.510
 very successful with the pringue and with 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.670
 riccardo but it was time after 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.069
 seven years of giving a refreshed to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.510
 team even more was a change that 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.900
 our consumers were asking 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.410
 for us the boss here and who has 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.230
 that be 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.560
 the needs of our game in 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.510
 Latin America the consumer was ready 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.630
 the consumer had not asked for them and is 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.250
 that's why we bring it in three hours 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.140
 recording were 25 days or so 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.000
 varied in the number of hours of 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.430
 recording on each of the days but 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.120
 an average of four hours a day 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.120
 during three months 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.050
 I lost count the truth and 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.830
 I did not notice much either because it was like 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.270
 that looked at the total I was going to despair 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.880
 because we did not reach the end 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.370
 then like that 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.990
 and it goes according to the number of sentences that 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.140
 recorded daily was 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.990
 at 600-700 daily phrase between names and 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.990
 others in quantities we talk about one thing 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.139
 because it misplaces you too I am like 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.150
 you take a little orbit 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.230
 you can not talk about the word because 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.180
 there were many repetitions 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.590
 many times we talk about referees 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.200
 many times we talk about the cuts 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.930
 many times they talk about the penal fails 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.320
 of injured players 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.740
 that we talk about so many things that 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.450
 end ends asking what he chose not to 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.950
 the total number I do not know the truth and 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.320
 it would be interesting me my comment 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.140
 it's tremendous I said good this is going to take 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.290
 more than a day not in my case it was not so much 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.910
 like what mario and fernando did 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.920
 but good thing mine fits that to 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.300
 players injured to movements 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.700
 tactics that the technician makes 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.710
 he directed not to his assistant to all that guy 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.300
 of things or incidental that are going 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.310
 occurring in a meeting number of 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.870
 pages I do not know will have been about 50-60 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.970
 phrases I have no idea how many there are 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.130
 four modifications between a number 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.560
 very important there are four that stand out 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.420
 for you and for three the first of them 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.120
 is a 9 is a control of the ball a lot 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.979
 most important when receiving and sending 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.199
 passes our friends will find 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.639
 some important differences the second 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.010
 it's advantages in intelligence 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.720
 artificial players will now see 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.000
 to work together and in 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.830
 collaboration the decisions that the 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.680
 team while only controlling the ball 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.910
 they are much more efficient and strategies 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.650
 the third one is a triple or very 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.440
 particular we just launched 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.060
 fifa suite a few months ago and our 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.250
 team working in carry their 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.320
 collaboration between themselves fifa have 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.580
 implemented some of those very levels 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.560
 very well very important and exciting 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.240
 live they have implemented fixed for 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.160
 that the player can also carry 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.919
 out your sale 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.480
 finally on fifa 12 we saw that the engine 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.730
 of impact 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.680
 it gave an evolution to the game of 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.480
 feedback in the physical interaction that 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.340
 there is between players what we have 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.990
 refined this impact engine now not 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.240
 nothing else in the attack is going to see 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.830
 always in defense in the burden of 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.360
 players and in the interaction that they have 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.070
 among them will give you an experience 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.070
 much more the channel realism 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.350
 Occasionally yes loser too if you can 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.570
 bring to play with my 7 year old son not 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.450
 I never won but I like it because 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.540
 I do not have a lot of practice, I do not have 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.130
 skill with my hand but if I have a 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.170
 son that is a phenomenon for another game 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.420
 I like the sea in the madden 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:40.850
 american football I am a sick 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.850
 also and if I can tell you that the sea 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.710
 arrives at the moment they are winning me because 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:50.100
 here that level of realism the whole part 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:53.070
 strategic tactical technique if you're not 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.230
 well tucked and you do not work well ends 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.820
 winning not then if of my other 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.300
 favorite is evil football 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.300
 definitely
