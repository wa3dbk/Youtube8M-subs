00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hello everyone, Sanya, and today we are with 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.610
 you will consider a new map in qzgu 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.549
 principle map we know and that yes 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.090
 bo beam ball bible different name of this 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.860
 cards 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.380
 after a year and a half finally 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.160
 the developers decided to introduce 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.600
 competitive cs go 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.060
 before that, as you know, there was no map 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.619
 It was at one time very popular 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.690
 especially since 2004 5 6 repentance in the rally 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.610
 because of the imbalance than was 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.950
 imbalance that cantor terrorists 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.980
 recruited a huge part of the rounds 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.500
 thanks so to speak convenient 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.140
 sniper position 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.200
 which sniper cats controlled 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 a huge part of the map right here 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.880
 a bridge like this a scion 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 controlled and almost impossible 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.650
 had to go to b 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.190
 means in this version in counter strike 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.890
 bol on Plenty and basically nothing 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.390
 the same boxes have changed only now this 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.260
 some extension booths brick 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.159
 the only thing that is impossible now is 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 take a seat on the idea here is impossible but 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.190
 still can be controlled 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.880
 under the bridge using a century so the passage 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.840
 on basically complicated enough though 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.360
 the only thing that added the only thing 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.260
 what the developers have added is this 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.460
 junction of the process here under this bridge 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.280
 respectively, if before hauling 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.640
 took it 10-15 seconds and now it's 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.560
 the matter of three seconds is simple and you are already in 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.860
 shoots accordingly plan your 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.080
 attack on a little bit easier though again 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 this passage is in question because 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.899
 sniper will simply not forgive but 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 except point a and point b naturally on b 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:20.400
 there are some positive changes 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:24.400
 namely this passage 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.060
 here is this passage that was added 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.270
 we have a standard output for b 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.400
 who everyone took that just 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.470
 never had a chance but the passage 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 which is added that is from the terrorists and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:50.080
 a chance to fall off like that on you 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:54.910
 from here or even further plan 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:00.570
 your attack come here this earlier 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.570
 was called the ten to fall into the ten and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.300
 fly further in general and go almost 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.810
 longer on 1 outlines all too 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:24.390
 a dozen i.e. exit or from here 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:27.549
 to be or from here therefore tactics principle 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.299
 will plan more attack a bit 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:35.140
 easier but actually will need 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.110
 see more how it all goes it 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.090
 here we have a plan used to understand this bomb 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.690
 put somewhere here with this fountain 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.100
 monuments monument to the creator 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.350
 counter-strike and here everything is the same without 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.790
 chance position is just 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.520
 sniper kills here and principle can 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.640
 control both of these outputs on b 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.540
 so I can say that the Terror 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.790
 there will be some chances but the first time 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.580
 in any will yet many will 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.920
 study all sorts of chips on this card you 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.990
 cape maki and so on because 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.450
 for sure 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.299
 banks fly through the top and here they fly 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.980
 through the top, respectively, and then probably 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:37.240
 you can smoke the roof 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:43.150
 too big but still flies 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.130
 could fly here accordingly 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.890
 you can come up with some make 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.000
 here from such positions that it was impossible 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.980
 kill the guys who are under the bridge 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.440
 Thank you all for seeing 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.440
 this brief overview of new meetings
