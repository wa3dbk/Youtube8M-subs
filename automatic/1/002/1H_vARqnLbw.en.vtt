bit of green stevia powder you can use
the<00:03:57.950> white<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.340> prefer<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.730> green<00:03:58.909> because<00:03:59.329> it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
the white I prefer the green because it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.030 
the white I prefer the green because it

comes from a plant and plans or green so

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.339 
comes from a plant and plans or green so
it's<00:04:01.159> a<00:04:01.219> little<00:04:01.579> less<00:04:01.790> processed<00:04:02.359> then<00:04:03.230> we're

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
it's a little less processed then we're

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.619 
it's a little less processed then we're
going<00:04:03.439> to<00:04:03.499> take<00:04:03.560> this<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.249> grind<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.209> all<00:04:05.359> I'm
