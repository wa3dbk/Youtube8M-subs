00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it on this particular car if you had an

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.859 
it on this particular car if you had an
older<00:01:09.530> discovery<00:01:10.130> one<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.329> steering

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
older discovery one the steering

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.459 
older discovery one the steering
stabilizers<00:01:12.710> attached<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.610> one<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:15.110> what

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
stabilizers attached to that one so what

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.209 
stabilizers attached to that one so what
the<00:01:15.619> usual<00:01:16.100> problem<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:16.700> with<00:01:16.880> these<00:01:17.149> is

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
the usual problem is with these is

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.469 
the usual problem is with these is
either<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:21.100> tie<00:01:22.100> rod<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.520> ball<00:01:22.759> joint<00:01:23.149> gets

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
either the tie rod and ball joint gets

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.649 
either the tie rod and ball joint gets
worn<00:01:23.840> out<00:01:24.020> loose<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.930> boots<00:01:27.140> get<00:01:27.380> torn<00:01:27.680> up<00:01:27.829> and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
worn out loose the boots get torn up and

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.580 
worn out loose the boots get torn up and
you<00:01:29.659> want<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.899> replace<00:01:30.229> it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
you want to replace it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.499 
you want to replace it
and<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.250> have<00:01:31.399> to<00:01:31.520> tell<00:01:31.700> them<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.909> know<00:01:32.030> if

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
and you have to tell them you know if

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.179 
and you have to tell them you know if
you're<00:01:32.750> doing<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.079> track<00:01:33.500> router<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.950> drag

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
you're doing the track router to drag

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.969 
you're doing the track router to drag
link<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:35.390> next<00:01:35.719> problem<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.259> these<00:01:36.500> cars<00:01:36.799> are

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
link the next problem is these cars are

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.660 
link the next problem is these cars are
getting<00:01:37.219> old<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:39.229> pay<00:01:39.439> somebody<00:01:39.799> labor<00:01:40.250> or

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
getting old to pay somebody labor or

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.319 
getting old to pay somebody labor or
your<00:01:40.729> labor<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:42.619> get<00:01:43.130> this<00:01:43.399> out<00:01:43.640> because<00:01:44.000> it's

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
your labor to get this out because it's

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.349 
your labor to get this out because it's
rusted<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:44.929> tight<00:01:45.310> sometimes<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:46.670> just<00:01:46.850> a

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
rusted and tight sometimes it's just a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.749 
rusted and tight sometimes it's just a
smarter<00:01:47.780> deal<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.649> buy<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.859> whole<00:01:49.159> unit<00:01:49.609> I

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
smarter deal to buy the whole unit I

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.910 
smarter deal to buy the whole unit I
mean<00:01:50.329> especially<00:01:50.689> if<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.380> one<00:01:51.530> on<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.770> other

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
mean especially if the one on the other

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.419 
mean especially if the one on the other
end<00:01:52.159> goes<00:01:53.119> bad<00:01:53.420> it's<00:01:54.200> part<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:54.799> whole<00:01:55.100> rod

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
end goes bad it's part of this whole rod

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.849 
end goes bad it's part of this whole rod
so<00:01:55.759> you'd<00:01:55.909> have<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.149> buy<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.390> anyway<00:01:56.869> it's<00:01:57.679> not

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
so you'd have to buy it anyway it's not

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.679 
so you'd have to buy it anyway it's not
that<00:01:58.009> much<00:01:58.100> more<00:01:58.369> money<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.819> get<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.119> adjuster

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
that much more money to get the adjuster

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.289 
that much more money to get the adjuster
the<00:01:59.719> clamps<00:02:00.499> and<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.799> other<00:02:01.009> tie<00:02:01.850> rod<00:02:02.060> ball

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
the clamps and the other tie rod ball

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.200 
the clamps and the other tie rod ball
joint<00:02:02.569> here<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.979> then<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.520> makes<00:02:04.700> doing<00:02:05.090> the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
joint here and then it makes doing the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.730 
joint here and then it makes doing the
alignment<00:02:05.749> a<00:02:05.869> hundred<00:02:06.350> percent

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
alignment a hundred percent

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.830 
alignment a hundred percent
easier<00:02:07.330> this<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.479> can<00:02:08.630> see<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:10.600> drag<00:02:11.600> link

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
easier this you can see is the drag link

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.450 
easier this you can see is the drag link
because<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:12.410> where<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.040> steering

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
because that's where the steering

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.590 
because that's where the steering
stabilizer<00:02:13.730> will<00:02:14.270> go

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
stabilizer will go

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.520 
stabilizer will go
