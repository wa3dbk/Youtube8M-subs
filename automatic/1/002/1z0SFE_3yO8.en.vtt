00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
we will not preparing the pattern which

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.390 
we will not preparing the pattern which
will<00:00:10.430> be<00:00:10.580> used<00:00:10.760> to<00:00:10.850> cut<00:00:11.150> both<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:12.139> cover<00:00:13.040> and

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
will be used to cut both the cover and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.519 
will be used to cut both the cover and
the<00:00:13.670> liner<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:16.490> pattern<00:00:16.880> is<00:00:17.290> printed<00:00:18.290> on<00:00:18.500> the

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
the liner the pattern is printed on the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.900 
the liner the pattern is printed on the
five<00:00:18.910> sheets<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.090> paper<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:20.750> needs<00:00:21.140> to<00:00:21.289> be

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
five sheets of paper that needs to be

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.179 
five sheets of paper that needs to be
cut<00:00:22.910> out<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.300> assembled<00:00:23.779> together<00:00:23.980> we<00:00:24.980> will

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
cut out and assembled together we will

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.560 
cut out and assembled together we will
be<00:00:25.279> starting<00:00:25.609> with<00:00:26.109> first<00:00:27.109> sheet<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:28.390> we<00:00:29.390> will

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
be starting with first sheet and we will

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.880 
be starting with first sheet and we will
be<00:00:29.720> cutting<00:00:30.109> on<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.340> edge<00:00:31.900> along<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:32.960> thin

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
be cutting on the edge along the thin

00:00:33.890 --> 00:01:03.090 
be cutting on the edge along the thin
dotted<00:00:34.820> blue<00:00:35.300> line

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.170 

so<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.900> first<00:01:07.150> side<00:01:08.150> will<00:01:08.810> spam<00:01:09.080> oh<00:01:09.110> let's<00:01:09.619> cut

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
so the first side will spam oh let's cut

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:20.300 
so the first side will spam oh let's cut
moving<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.360> next<00:01:11.509> one

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.889 

all<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.210> panels<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> pattern<00:01:22.619> uh<00:01:22.860> no<00:01:23.040> cut

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
all the panels for a pattern uh no cut

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.139 
all the panels for a pattern uh no cut
now<00:01:24.899> we<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.500> assemble<00:01:25.829> them<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.119> not

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
now we have to assemble them this is not

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.330 
now we have to assemble them this is not
very<00:01:30.450> complicated<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:31.740> arranged<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
very complicated we arranged on the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
very complicated we arranged on the
table<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:33.539> panels<00:01:34.820> starting<00:01:35.820> from<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.630> left

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
table the panels starting from the left

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.679 
table the panels starting from the left

eye to bottom one sometimes the writing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.029 
eye to bottom one sometimes the writing
gets<00:01:45.299> cut<00:01:45.539> off<00:01:45.689> depending<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.679> size<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
gets cut off depending on the size of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.789 
gets cut off depending on the size of
the<00:01:47.159> bellow<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.030> useful<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.439> make<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> note

the bellow so it's useful to make a note

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.880 
the bellow so it's useful to make a note
on<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> panel<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.869> panel<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> is

assuming the writing that off once we

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:58.669 
assuming the writing that off once we

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
have found the position we will be

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.719 
have found the position we will be

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
first we will be cutting the diamond

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.500 
first we will be cutting the diamond
shaped<00:04:31.060> holes<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:36.400> actual<00:04:36.760> cut<00:04:37.000> line<00:04:37.240> is
