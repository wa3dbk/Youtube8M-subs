00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
puncher and make a hole at the top just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.000 
puncher and make a hole at the top just
like<00:03:04.620> that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
like that

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.199

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
dry then you take a little bit of thread

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.670 
dry then you take a little bit of thread
and<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.420> could<00:03:12.569> be<00:03:12.690> any<00:03:12.840> kind<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.230> thread<00:03:13.500> in

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and it could be any kind of thread in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.619 
and it could be any kind of thread in
this<00:03:13.980> case<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.400> using<00:03:14.430> embroidery<00:03:15.299> thread

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
this case I'm using embroidery thread

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.670 
this case I'm using embroidery thread
and<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.860> am<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.819> go<00:03:18.360> ahead<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.959> make<00:03:19.260> kind

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and I am going to go ahead and make kind

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.289 
and I am going to go ahead and make kind
of<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:20.010> little<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:22.799> don't<00:03:23.579> know<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:23.879> call<00:03:24.180> it

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
of like a little I don't know I call it

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.890 
of like a little I don't know I call it
loop<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.780> hang<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.730> caught<00:03:27.690> that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
loop to hang it with so I caught that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.069 
loop to hang it with so I caught that
off<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.680> excess<00:03:29.099> off<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.700> then<00:03:30.450> I'm<00:03:30.629> going<00:03:30.870> to

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
off the excess off and then I'm going to

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.619 
off the excess off and then I'm going to
pass<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:33.360> thread<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:35.359> from<00:03:36.359> one

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
pass the thread just like this from one

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.250 
pass the thread just like this from one
side<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:37.980> other<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.790> then<00:03:39.660> I'm<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.989> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
side to the other and then I'm going to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.009 
side to the other and then I'm going to
pull<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.069> that's<00:03:42.030> basically<00:03:42.480> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019
