00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.050 

and<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.620> can<00:03:45.770> see<00:03:46.099> I'm<00:03:46.340> starting<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.910> get<00:03:47.000> a

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and you can see I'm starting to get a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.699 
and you can see I'm starting to get a
little<00:03:47.420> bit<00:03:47.569> of<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.720> curve<00:03:48.019> here<00:03:48.050> already<00:03:53.709> so

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
little bit of a curve here already so

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:17.340 
little bit of a curve here already so
two<00:03:54.769> more<00:03:55.340> rows<00:03:55.720> slipping<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.870> third<00:03:57.200> stitch

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.560 

and<00:04:17.860> then<00:04:18.130> one<00:04:18.880> row<00:04:20.400> where<00:04:21.400> all<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
and then one row where all of the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.550 
and then one row where all of the
stitches<00:04:23.020> are<00:04:23.290> knit<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:25.320> circulars<00:04:26.320> are<00:04:26.530> a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
stitches are knit and circulars are a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.070 
stitches are knit and circulars are a
little<00:04:26.710> more<00:04:26.950> fiddly<00:04:27.340> than<00:04:27.670> double<00:04:28.630> points

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
little more fiddly than double points

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.990 
little more fiddly than double points
but<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:32.470> like<00:04:32.650> my<00:04:32.860> addi<00:04:33.100> turbos<00:04:33.640> so<00:04:33.850> that's

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
but I just like my addi turbos so that's

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.180 
but I just like my addi turbos so that's
why<00:04:34.180> I'm<00:04:34.330> using<00:04:34.480> these<00:04:34.840> instead<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.500> double

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
why I'm using these instead of double

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.510 
why I'm using these instead of double
pointed<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.170> would<00:04:41.530> just<00:04:41.680> continue<00:04:41.860> in

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
pointed so you would just continue in

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.780 
pointed so you would just continue in
that<00:04:42.820> manner<00:04:43.770> until<00:04:44.770> your<00:04:44.950> eye<00:04:45.070> cord<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.640> as

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
that manner until your eye cord is as

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.230 
that manner until your eye cord is as
long<00:04:46.000> as<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:46.300> want<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:48.280> will<00:04:48.520> begin<00:04:48.880> to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
long as you want and it will begin to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.910 
long as you want and it will begin to
spiral<00:04:49.600> as<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.170> see<00:04:50.380> here<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.650> already

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
spiral as you can see here I already

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.430 
spiral as you can see here I already
have<00:04:51.040> a<00:04:51.220> spiral<00:04:51.670> started<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.450> you<00:04:53.080> might<00:04:53.260> need

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
have a spiral started and you might need

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.560 
have a spiral started and you might need
to<00:04:53.500> help<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.160> out<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> little<00:04:54.610> bit<00:04:54.880> by<00:04:55.120> wrapping

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
to help it out a little bit by wrapping

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.690 
to help it out a little bit by wrapping
it<00:04:55.690> around<00:04:55.840> your<00:04:56.140> fingers<00:04:57.540> but<00:04:59.460> should<00:05:00.460> pretty

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
it around your fingers but should pretty

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.310 
it around your fingers but should pretty
much<00:05:00.820> curl<00:05:01.780> on<00:05:02.080> its<00:05:02.260> own<00:05:02.790> so<00:05:03.790> that<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.570> how<00:05:04.780> to

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
much curl on its own so that is how to

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.570 
much curl on its own so that is how to
knit<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.820> spiral<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:07.000> chord
