00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.330
 well this is a video tutorial for 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:09.880
 install the grade with the nose if you 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.690
 they ask nothing I told them is a hack 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 first they will execute 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:22.119
 then an app gives you a percent of life 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.560
 he takes graft end and now this one they give him 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.900
 Rename 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.900
 real bar 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.030
 real 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.010
 and move this program that when 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.260
 download included the Christians were 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.260
 download and good 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.110
 change a big man min 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.060
 Thank you 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.330
 I think this is one of the few videos 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.390
 to install a do not search in Spanish 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.000
 good after doing that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.140
 good they close us 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.140
 inside the mini cross 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.260
 user input 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.690
 and this is not going to look like this when 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.690
 the multiplayer is added 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.990
 i 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.260
 and well I'm going to get away from the server but 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.980
 I will hide them as in password 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.980
 to all 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.450
 ready now one hour appears and it's going to 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.370
 look like a bar and side only 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.300
 I was 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.300
 that those who rule 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.320
 best sounds 0 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.310
 good 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.470
 when I think it's faster than not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.310
 it's no good imagination to pull that out 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.530
 it's horrible that's why in the one where 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.580
 that appears 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.190
 is a customer to laugh steady 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.200
 to put things from the server they put 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.560
 this type would be to be of 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 day to get the day of banesto 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.310
 back 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.379
 but itching when when with the equestrian 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.709
 on the ground they will apply 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.709
 automatically everything else 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.540
 good 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.850
 well I guess I'll leave next 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.740
 part 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.920
 I'm going to enlarge the songs and it does not look very 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.920
 good 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.460
 to fly would be r 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.600
 I recommend you use this command 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.280
 this case to fly because if not yes 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.590
 it lands in a very high place it starts 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.750
 to take good little nothing but to give them 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 it takes away some life as if they were from a 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.460
 high place so that's the one that's 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.630
 it serves so that you do not fall in a place 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.630
 high does not take away 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.100
 but that I am not with very strong nor very 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.100
 low 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.940
 very strong 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.940
 I do not have much with me 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.800
 today we have all those who can not 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.800
 see you see serves 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.740
 this would be I do not know what it is but not 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.080
 reference this would be for when they see a 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.970
 player does not let him look but they are 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.690
 automatically manages the mouse 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.090
 camera 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:15.269
 and this when they put this and this 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.269
 combined and looks at him and attacks him at once 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.270
 these things are automatic like 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.270
 Automatic automatic mining 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.470
 with the same 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.110
 the trance that is this is the spider 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.110
 you can colors 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.500
 has the corner ceiling a spider 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.500
 of corner figure 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.860
 was today crazy superman 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.720
 good a code a code to fly 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.910
 automatically 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.650
 there are few codes bone shortcuts the r 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:08.310
 one of gifts 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:12.330
 and explain is like a copy of you 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.970
 I would be fine with this server 11.1 but now 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.160
 this turn used for me 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.460
 get arrows in his fish because 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.870
 he played the buttons behind the wall 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.870
 because with this through the wall 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.950
 and since you build and play or paul 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.140
 anka records 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.560
 well I guess in a second part 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.810
 later 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.080
 maybe I'll say the same again 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.080
 so they do not take long to get on 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.080
 they counted
