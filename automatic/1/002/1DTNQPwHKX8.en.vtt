the deals it brings in size it's great
and<00:05:10.250> I<00:05:10.490> think<00:05:10.550> I<00:05:10.970> think<00:05:11.479> Sony<00:05:11.870> had<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.320> charge

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
and I think I think Sony had to charge

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.200 
and I think I think Sony had to charge
for<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:12.889> now<00:05:13.100> because<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.699> know<00:05:13.820> it's<00:05:14.030> gonna

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
for it now because you know it's gonna

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.210 
for it now because you know it's gonna
be<00:05:14.389> so<00:05:14.570> big<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.990> think<00:05:15.050> they<00:05:15.260> need<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.500> get<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.830> bit

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
be so big I think they need to get a bit

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.650 
be so big I think they need to get a bit
of<00:05:16.340> money<00:05:16.460> out<00:05:16.699> of<00:05:16.729> it<00:05:16.910> but<00:05:17.060> people<00:05:17.330> don't<00:05:17.419> care

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
of money out of it but people don't care

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.510 
of money out of it but people don't care
they're<00:05:18.199> already<00:05:18.410> playing<00:05:18.740> they're<00:05:19.220> already
