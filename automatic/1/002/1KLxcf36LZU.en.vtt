00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
I'm actually gonna have to figure out

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.020 
I'm actually gonna have to figure out
how<00:03:37.380> I'm<00:03:37.500> gonna<00:03:37.650> put<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.070> my<00:03:38.160> cabinet<00:03:38.640> my

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
how I'm gonna put this in my cabinet my

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.729 
how I'm gonna put this in my cabinet my
cab<00:03:39.269> knee<00:03:39.450> doesn't<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.959> really<00:03:40.200> good<00:03:40.440> depth

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
cab knee doesn't have really good depth

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.850 
cab knee doesn't have really good depth
I'm<00:03:40.980> hoping<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:42.320> really<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.680> much

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
I'm hoping because really it's not much

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.440 
I'm hoping because really it's not much
bigger<00:03:44.190> than<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.670> triple<00:03:45.030> seven<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.420> think

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
bigger than the triple seven I think

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.500 
bigger than the triple seven I think
it's<00:03:45.780> actually<00:03:45.930> smaller<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> body<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.450> you

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
it's actually smaller in the body so you

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.710 
it's actually smaller in the body so you
know<00:03:48.750> what<00:03:48.840> we'll<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.200> see<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:51.150> comes

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
know what we'll have to see and it comes

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.550 
know what we'll have to see and it comes
with<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.760> standard<00:03:54.209> Gemini<00:03:54.600> just<00:03:54.870> stand<00:03:55.200> this
