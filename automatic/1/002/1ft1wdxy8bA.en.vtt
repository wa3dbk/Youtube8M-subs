00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 Hey everyone, how are you, this face? 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.720
 influence of the new reverend and the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 People are going to talk a little about 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.239
 contain perfect skin 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 They came close, good to me. 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
 Do you know your friend's time in person? 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.309
 has a very large water problem 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:49.289
 When I was younger, it's night. 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:52.649
 I went to visit the monterrey 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.199
 monkey who has a spine in the face 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.469
 You know how much it bothers you and knows me. 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.100
 only knows that before five months ago 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.039
 behind 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 this here on my skin was crowded with 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.770
 red spots very very red and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020
 arrived at a point where he was no longer 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 slow then I say I will not stay like this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 huh 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.799
 time alone including because I 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 I like to see, for example, it goes out on the street at 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.610
 times without makeup because so at 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.540
 sometimes use in the house to overdo it may 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.520
 more 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 I always find it very cool who has a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 very beautiful skin and could 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.020
 go outside whenever there puts a base 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 It's not even and I can not leave the house. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.570
 so base is one thing here 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 I already tried but I could not get myself 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.790
 Bother gets bothered as there is a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.399
 thing that I wanted so much time then 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.770
 I decided to go to a dermatologist and 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.259
 ask a few questions about her 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.680
 All I just did is not take it off. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.750
 It increases and much less doubts, it's me. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 I really wanted to tell you what the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.560
 causes of pimples 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 besides the food that we know 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.040
 also childhood 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.569
 to feed a thing also drink 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.530
 water decreases is greatly improve the skin 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.030
 and one thing that is a product one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.470
 medicine she passed 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.120
 the drug does not even know if can 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.630
 call medicines 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 she passed the video to seed inclusive is 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.760
 Ending and I use a lot is the wind 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 watch for who does not know is a gel is a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.120
 subject and then the first week ever seen 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.680
 a lot of difference what's going to happen 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.110
 in the first few days of my 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.190
 skin to start peeling is to stay 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.340
 red 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.160
 so I was going to work and work and I 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 I was very ashamed because I had 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.989
 started working there now between the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.430
 now enclosed in quotation marks that have 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.860
 time and then I would go with a 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.650
 skin, nothing really cool, I was very 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.920
 old still with that it was peeling 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.560
 turned red were few times 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 who got itchy a little too 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.410
 I even took a picture to put the plan. 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.410
 before and I think he gave a 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.440
 very strong and very fast result. 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.079
 I 'm sure I'm happy with it. 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.769
 but one thing I would like to tell 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:26.340
 the doctor spent two things to buy 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.290
 use beyond vita so I'll say that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.570
 she according to her to use 12 in 12 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.680
 hours that I do not put in two 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.750
 in two hours 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.350
 who puts so always when you leave 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.829
 home can put makeup all life 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.630
 I put everything and what I use hamilton 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.859
 but she's new to this regional 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.859
 passed another one there 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.560
 all life before bed and a digit to 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:55.129
 Save me if I step it's soap that she 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.810
 passed what is cetaf u 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:03.479
 and then I clean slowly not 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:08.520
 very strong and then the habit 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:11.009
 acij with light layers this bastard is 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.680
 not to put a lev call no 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.669
 to put too much because it is strong and 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.150
 inclusive is not indicated for 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:25.020
 pregnant women or children under 12 years 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.370
 years and neither hypertensive nor 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.550
 for people who have injured skin 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.639
 for example only if by chance on your face 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.840
 have a wound not just put 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.780
 there in that cold is so I use 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.690
 whole life before bed, leaving the 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.759
 story is a danger because I always 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.880
 I usually sleep face down in tone 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.099
 I always put on my face like that 8 and it's 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.979
 too complicated for those who do not feel 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.949
 or whoever sleeps so you know how much you 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.319
 It's difficult to stay the night and 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:03.719
 Little face, right? 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:05.969
 on the pillow in bed and in the morning when 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:10.020
 wake up my whole my face with a 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:12.599
 u soap product and strip CETAF 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.590
 step the sunscreen 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.870

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.110

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.800

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:32.020

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:57.280
