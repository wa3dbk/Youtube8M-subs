00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.390
 I'm learning to play the drums 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.390
 to enter a rock group 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 how funny they dress how cool they are 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.560

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.090
 I also think they dress funny 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.330
 here and I liked the battery a lot 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.710
 new billy and touching it seemed very 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.159
 funny 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.500
 good both battery 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.500
 milli 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 Y 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.180
 to play your drums if you already 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.430
 we can 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.430
 Well, I'm afraid I'm not 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.560
 because it's new and you're too small to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.340
 touch it you can break something 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.340
 years 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.050
 it's my battery and those are my rules 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.040
 Batteries are for adults not for children 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.040
 sorry 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.109
 it's not fair we're not so small no 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:31.469
 we are as small as rossi we can 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:34.920
 do things that adults do like 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:40.099
 that we have to demonstrate Americans 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.099
 we are small children and so we go 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.640
 hello mom I'm going to make a sandwich for 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 billy 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:07.700
 and I'm going to take the milk that I was 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.700
 very proud of having poured milk 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.750
 weak and without throwing a single drop here 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.489
 you have that there you can take away the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:28.160
 edges mom also likes to 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:32.349
 sandwiches without them here you have 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.349
 clementa did you do we go call it 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.930
 and pass 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.710
 in fact butter sandwich 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.860
 peanut alone mother has taken him 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.570
 the edges but it's been my idea to take 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.020
 Billy has been careful and I have not thrown 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.530
 nothing 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.940
 you've never brought me the snack before 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.470
 but that's because before we were only 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.630
 small children and now we are big 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.310
 I already understand that you will touch my 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.260
 drums 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.770
 I'm sorry you are not yet enough 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.770
 older though thanks for the sandwich 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.380
 there he wondered how clement ainielle 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:24.300
 could show billy that they were already 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.300
 older to play their drums 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.410
 so I had a fantastic idea 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.480
 past 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.410

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.940

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.940

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.140

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.660

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.660

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.560
 there is a pedal down there but with the foot 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.250
 that's called hype here and I loved it 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.590
 that each drum would sound different but 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.800
 he liked the sound of the cymbal 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.800
 plus 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.790
 Thank you

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:36.250

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.570
 Park swings is where there was 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.280

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:06.819
