00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
huge pro to me and obviously the slide

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.910

pumping<00:01:20.970> cocking<00:01:21.530> which<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.710> saw

pumping cocking which you just saw
eye-shine<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> how<00:01:25.320> does<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> gun<00:01:25.680> work

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
eye-shine so how does the gun work

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.760 
eye-shine so how does the gun work
basically<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.590> some

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
basically what you do is you get some

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
basically what you do is you get some
salt<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.689> chamber

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
salt and you got the little chamber

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.730 
salt and you got the little chamber
right<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:32.100> pop<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> open<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
right here you pop that open and you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.420 
right here you pop that open and you
fill<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.369> salt<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.570> goes

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
fill it with your salt and that goes

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.240 
fill it with your salt and that goes
about<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.670> deep<00:01:38.909> into<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> gun<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.130> can

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
about that deep into the gun so we can

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
about that deep into the gun so we can
hold<00:01:41.460> quite<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.970> 50<00:01:42.360> shots<00:01:42.840> worth<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
