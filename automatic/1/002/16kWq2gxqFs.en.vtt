00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470 

I<00:00:00.620> know<00:00:01.620> everyone<00:00:02.280> says<00:00:02.310> that<00:00:02.610> they<00:00:02.970> won't<00:00:03.210> do

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
I know everyone says that they won't do

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.210 
I know everyone says that they won't do
it<00:00:03.689> but<00:00:04.230> there's<00:00:04.440> going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.710> come<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.920> time

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
it but there's going to come a time

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.870 
it but there's going to come a time
we're<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.819> have<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.150> use<00:00:06.390> high<00:00:06.779> ISO<00:00:07.319> on

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
we're going to have to use high ISO on

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.610 
we're going to have to use high ISO on
whatever<00:00:08.880> camera<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.719> you're<00:00:09.929> using<00:00:10.110> when<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
whatever camera that you're using when I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.180 
whatever camera that you're using when I
mean<00:00:10.889> high<00:00:11.070> ISO<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> mean<00:00:11.790> above<00:00:12.559> I<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
mean high ISO I mean above I so a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.620 
mean high ISO I mean above I so a
thousand<00:00:14.730> or<00:00:14.820> ISO<00:00:15.120> 3200<00:00:15.599> maybe<00:00:16.170> even<00:00:16.410> iso

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
thousand or ISO 3200 maybe even iso

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.550 
thousand or ISO 3200 maybe even iso
12800<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:20.460> ways<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.260> combat<00:00:22.260> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
12800 so there are ways to combat this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.859 
12800 so there are ways to combat this
and<00:00:22.859> actually<00:00:23.340> make<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> footage<00:00:24.150> usable<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and actually make the footage usable and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.170 
and actually make the footage usable and
I'm<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.199> show<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.800> before<00:00:26.580> footage

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
I'm going to show you a before footage

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
I'm going to show you a before footage
right<00:00:27.660> now<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.449> shot<00:00:30.949> on<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.550> gh2<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.989> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
right now this is shot on a gh2 but is

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.400 
right now this is shot on a gh2 but is
applicable<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.540> any<00:00:36.540> camera<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.230> shoots

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
applicable to any camera that shoots

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.299 
applicable to any camera that shoots
high<00:00:37.680> ISO<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.629> 176<00:00:40.410> megabits<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.190> I'm

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
high ISO this is 176 megabits so I'm

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
high ISO this is 176 megabits so I'm
getting<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> most<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.690> super-high

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
getting the most out of this super-high

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
getting the most out of this super-high
soap<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.559> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:47.039> after<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
soap but and this is an after of what it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
soap but and this is an after of what it
can<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.050> fix<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.280> let<00:00:50.430> me<00:00:50.520> tell<00:00:50.700> you

color reproduction is going to be the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.660 
color reproduction is going to be the
color<00:01:24.570> green<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.400> color

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670

might be in your editor of choice the
next<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.570> ran<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> only

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
next thing that I ran on this and I only

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920 
next thing that I ran on this and I only
did<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.159> particular<00:01:44.689> bit<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
did this on this particular bit of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.499 
did this on this particular bit of
footage<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.979> make<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> look<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
footage to make it look different is a

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.560 
footage to make it look different is a
blurred<00:01:51.509> lens<00:01:52.259> flare<00:01:52.649> effect<00:01:53.210> from<00:01:54.210> the

Sapphire effects collection I'm running
this<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.180> Vegas<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.469> GPU<00:01:59.280> effects<00:01:59.729> so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
this in Vegas is a GPU effects so

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.270 
this in Vegas is a GPU effects so
renders<00:02:00.299> fairly<00:02:00.659> quickly<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.219> no<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
renders fairly quickly but no you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
renders fairly quickly but no you
wouldn't<00:02:02.700> use<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.360> scenes<00:02:03.719> but

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
wouldn't use this in all scenes but

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.499 
wouldn't use this in all scenes but
let's<00:02:04.530> sing<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.579> use<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> shot<00:02:06.149> let's

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
let's sing I have to use a shot let's

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.639 
let's sing I have to use a shot let's
say<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> shop<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.380> showed<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
say that the shop that i showed you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.360 
say that the shop that i showed you
before<00:02:07.770> has<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> used<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.920> really

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
before has to be used so if I really

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.910 
before has to be used so if I really
have<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> use<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.349> add<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
have to use it I can add the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490 
have to use it I can add the
effect<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.940> I'm<00:02:15.030> doing<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.569> I'm<00:02:15.750> adding

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
effect what I'm doing is that I'm adding

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.949 
effect what I'm doing is that I'm adding
more<00:02:16.950> color<00:02:17.250> information<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:18.150> top<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
more color information on top of the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.070 
more color information on top of the
image<00:02:19.080> yes<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.680> flare<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.730> helps<00:02:21.080> kind

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
image yes it's a flare but it helps kind

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.150 
image yes it's a flare but it helps kind
of<00:02:22.230> diffuse<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.660> information<00:02:24.660> behind<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.440> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
of diffuse the information behind it so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.059 
of diffuse the information behind it so
I'm<00:02:26.280> playing<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.910> trick<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.680> playing<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.770> trick

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
I'm playing a trick I'm playing a trick

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.670 
I'm playing a trick I'm playing a trick
in<00:02:29.220> order<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.760> fix<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.630> image<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.260> as<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> can

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in order to fix the image and as you can

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.800 
in order to fix the image and as you can
see<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.910> helps<00:02:33.530> mask<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.980> lot<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.430> ugliness

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
see it helps mask a lot of that ugliness

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.120 
see it helps mask a lot of that ugliness
the<00:02:36.810> final<00:02:37.140> step<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.500> i'm<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.800> add<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
the final step that i'm going to add and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.590 
the final step that i'm going to add and
you<00:02:38.190> don't<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.700> use<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:38.970> program<00:02:39.390> is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you don't have to use this program is

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.770 
you don't have to use this program is
something<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.470> i<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.830> pretty<00:02:41.340> often<00:02:41.780> it's

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
something that i use pretty often it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.940 
something that i use pretty often it's
magic<00:02:43.560> bullet<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.130> grain<00:02:44.940> effect<00:02:45.950> you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
magic bullet and the grain effect you

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.670 
magic bullet and the grain effect you
can<00:02:47.100> add<00:02:47.250> color<00:02:47.550> grain<00:02:47.819> i<00:02:47.850> add<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.200> percent

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
can add color grain i add just a percent

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.039 
can add color grain i add just a percent
maybe<00:02:50.220> two<00:02:50.550> percent<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:52.549> grain<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:54.299> footage

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
maybe two percent of grain to footage

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.710 
maybe two percent of grain to footage
and<00:02:55.319> if<00:02:56.010> you're<00:02:56.130> shooting<00:02:56.250> 720p<00:02:57.030> up<00:02:57.299> res<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
and if you're shooting 720p up res it's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.940 
and if you're shooting 720p up res it's
1080p<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.650> add<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.989> grain<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.709> adds

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
1080p and add this grain in and it adds

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.199 
1080p and add this grain in and it adds
in<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.910> little<00:03:03.330> extra<00:03:03.540> detail<00:03:04.200> now<00:03:05.000> why<00:03:06.000> am<00:03:06.120> i

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
in a little extra detail now why am i

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.600 
in a little extra detail now why am i
adding<00:03:06.390> grain<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.080> footage<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.010> ID<00:03:08.190> drained

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
adding grain to footage that ID drained

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.759 
adding grain to footage that ID drained
well<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.330> kind<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.989> better<00:03:10.230> than<00:03:10.440> an

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
well it's kind of it's better than an

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.949 
well it's kind of it's better than an
effect<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.220> an<00:03:11.549> unsharp<00:03:12.060> mask<00:03:12.330> but<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.780> does

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
effect like an unsharp mask but it does

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.110 
effect like an unsharp mask but it does
sort<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.350> same<00:03:13.530> thing<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:14.430> grain<00:03:14.819> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
sort of the same thing that grain is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.979 
sort of the same thing that grain is
adding<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:16.340> contrast<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.700> way<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.060> contrast

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
adding in contrast in a way in contrast

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.949 
adding in contrast in a way in contrast
is<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> eye<00:03:19.590> sees<00:03:19.709> as<00:03:20.430> sharpness<00:03:21.060> so

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
is what the eye sees as sharpness so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.410 
is what the eye sees as sharpness so
it's<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.829> something<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.340> will<00:03:23.730> look<00:03:23.940> I'm

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
it's not something that will look I'm

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.599 
it's not something that will look I'm
pleasing<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.890> not<00:03:26.070> something<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.430> you'd

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
pleasing it's not something that you'd

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.759 
pleasing it's not something that you'd
think<00:03:26.820> necessarily<00:03:27.359> would<00:03:27.630> look<00:03:27.810> good<00:03:28.079> but<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
think necessarily would look good but it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.460 
think necessarily would look good but it
actually<00:03:28.920> does<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.549> little<00:03:29.790> bit<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
actually does that little bit of

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.229 
actually does that little bit of
monochromatic<00:03:31.470> grain<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.760> background

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
monochromatic grain in the background

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.650 
monochromatic grain in the background
gives<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.350> sort<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.980> texture<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.239> glaze<00:03:36.630> over

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
gives it sort of a texture to glaze over

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.780 
gives it sort of a texture to glaze over
all<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.790> ugly<00:03:38.790> blurriness<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:41.670> know

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
all that ugly blurriness and you know

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.520 
all that ugly blurriness and you know
the<00:03:41.940> end<00:03:41.970> result<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.660> something<00:03:42.930> that's<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the end result is something that's a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.289 
the end result is something that's a
whole<00:03:43.709> lot<00:03:43.859> more<00:03:43.980> pleasing<00:03:44.340> than<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
whole lot more pleasing than the

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.770 
whole lot more pleasing than the
original<00:03:45.750> image<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.090> nutshell<00:03:51.120> is

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
original image and that in a nutshell is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.330 
original image and that in a nutshell is
an<00:03:51.989> easy<00:03:53.000> quick<00:03:54.000> way<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.709> make<00:03:55.709> usable<00:03:56.190> footage

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
an easy quick way to make usable footage

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.809 
an easy quick way to make usable footage
