00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to all nico de nicolas down so 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.460
 second video of the day bah yes I 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.889
 am on vacation the little is behind 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.059
 sleeping so I stay for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 take care of it so I take this opportunity to 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.130
 to make some videos today we're going 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.119
 what are we talking about today? 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.170
 of that it's going to be a very very video 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.960
 short but in two words I am very 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.820
 pleasantly surprised by this little trick 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.940
 this little thing huh what is it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.770
 a teflon triptych simply 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.760
 so the Teflon type dribble I'm there 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 come because I find sap 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.399
 aesthetic 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 in fact I find it nice to have a 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.870
 fashion and then to have something 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.879
 who finishes a little fashion 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.460
 and then something that does not convince 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.050
 not so I decided to buy his 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.320
 sweat mash up French pretty famous and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.219
 as soon as it happens and Jeremy 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.750
 Sorbonne elsewhere as much as here and suddenly 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.740
 I started to climb and I got 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.229
 says wow it's black it must cost 4 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.570
 euros 90 anti machin like that in two 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 Teflon words and has several virtues 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 especially the two main ones is that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 it's not sensitive to heat 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 to temperature variations so in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.360
 two words it's very hot he 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.150
 get very cold at the triptych is not going 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.860
 be altered by the temperature so 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 what does that mean 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.189
 what is it and if ever it really does 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.140
 very hot and I put it in his mouth 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.180
 will always have the same temperature as if 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.970
 I'm never under the snow 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 and then that I put it in my mouth this is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.390
 one of the first things and finally the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.119
 last is that it is a very weak 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.180
 in fact the liquid at very withdrawals 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.130
 little on it so I notice a lot 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.170
 much less back up liquid and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 honestly when you put in my mouth 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.110
 who likes well adapted by doing a little 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.110
 of its limits the art 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.980
 forgive me i like claude hrithik 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.010
 actually runs a little bit on my 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.110
 lips and the feeling that this 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.330
 guy there has nothing to do said eric 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 plastic that will heat up after a 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.780
 moment and who are going to have a little bit a 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.460
 rough side on the on the lips 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.810
 it has nothing to do there we are not at all 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.430
 in there it's something smooth 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.730
 pleasant to almost sweet on the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.840
 lips 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.880
 since it's a little bit there 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.290
 the only part out of the hands that in 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.190
 contact a little bit with us so in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.180
 the mouth occurrence 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.980
 I think it's really nice to have 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.670
 a somewhat noble material like this one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.600
 like teflon and that is hyper let's go 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.959
 so 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.450
 in two words it's really a whole 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.880
 little detail but now that I am 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.600
 spent there I still have the mode goes on 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:25.260
 on a video of 6 in the hand once 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:28.040
 that we change nonsense already that it is 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.299
 different not that it's unpleasant 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.600
 but that's all it's me 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.600
 I find 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.180
 I think it has an aesthetic side 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.400
 rather nice I like it so 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.180
 aesthetic side I like the side without 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.440
 way in the mouth does not like so too 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.090
 it's part of the little accessories 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.209
 which I highly recommend 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.290
 it's because being more expensive and me 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.000
 was a revelation 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.680
 I've been going for three weeks 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.720
 buy I can tell you that it's 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.019
 still a significant side besides the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.569
 wave 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.980
 so that's so gonna listen good end of 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.980
 day will not give you
