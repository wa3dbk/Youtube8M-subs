now<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> modified<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.690> technology<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.680> apply

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
now I modified this technology I apply

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
now I modified this technology I apply

can be seen in the dark

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
can be seen in the dark
yeah<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> every<00:01:14.250> day<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.060> make<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.479> unique
