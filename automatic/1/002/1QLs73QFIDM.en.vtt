00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 madam x 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.580
 hello everybody it was a beautiful 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.279
 influence on everything goes for a new 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.739
 body that my pub 1 800 behemoths 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.420
 as specified by his mastodon he did not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.760
 nobody no doubt roanne had 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.940
 mastodon during this video I was in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.629
 harmony shooter and royal company 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.190
 and its causes so in the beginning it was 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 was supposed to just make sleeves for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.290
 make money and be able to deposit 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:58.649
 at the bank and then enter the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.780
 secret so here are the falls to the sun so 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.829
 So here we go 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 previous ones we had found a 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.960
 technical good here it is it actually 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.330
 we put ourselves in the bank there is just 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.880
 spawn of zombies ie in the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.789
 window left to the right pardon excuseez 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.979
 me on my right the double way there and 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:23.360
 in the slope just behind the counter 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.800
 so I'm going to go so here it happens 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.380
 so just be yourself from them to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.429
 200 spectrum is good we could see that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.200
 yesterday with twitter so here and so we 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.030
 also noticed so many things 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 during this part as an asset 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.670
 hidden is available just for a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 Therefore let no 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.270
 special to do the person who will have 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.820
 so the character I currently have 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.750
 that is, whoever hears the voice of 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.380
 richthofen at the grain we all have 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.439
 orders 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 for him and only apple tree I had 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.210
 really you know that all 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.750
 other high characters none 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.280
 possibility 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.550
 so you will see all live at all 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.050
 to recognize him here I pose is born 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 an explosion is the asset of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.230
 counterfeit developers which is so 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.150
 available for the character I could I 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.800
 I could do on the rim is that you 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.459
 describe it I'm with the glasses 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 parliament here so we also noticed 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.030
 so another thing you 're fine 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.250
 now footer surprised barricades 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.380
 on the road and after a while we 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.269
 had barricades and so simple 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:45.450
 our tongue of wood he barricaded 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.860
 kinds of baas and wooden planks 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.319
 hamburg or improve the barricade 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.610
 also metal planks which he 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.610
 sports his visit 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.120
 be careful now here is the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.220
 deviance and metal boards 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.560
 zombies will take a lot more of 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.190
 expected time between the find it rather 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.190
 friendly 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:14.700
 so another technique was that everyone 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:17.999
 take a criminal so the entry 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.870
 house so we did a lot of sleeves 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:24.239
 So I'll 4 500 and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.650
 beautiful actions that fired and 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.290
 still saved especially 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.480
 training already so a round 18 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.030
 and now I have to admit it the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.919
 first we there was no 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.689
 a lot of wind Thursday that summer shooter 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:42.269
 inactive and so they were gone or 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:44.280
 reina paul laplante so royal and her 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.829
 bellemare causes says clark to see all 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.120
 the clues side to get me 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.689
 I'm running out of laser ammo 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.790
 So down I can not help him and 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:56.219
 I would say we can see there now 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.590
 the power of this name of this new 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.909
 laser that he still helped a lot 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.569
 because it rained all the same 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.379
 clean the room in some chargers 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.449
 two chargers I think he told me 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.639
 so there he manages to revive him on this 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.840
 super culture and so the second action 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.569
 so here we can see directly at 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.250
 level of those points that lille starts 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.099
 to have a lot of money so he has 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.380
 really want to keep it but it was 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.010
 still the basic purpose so I him 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.560
 tell 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.690
 go your most all your money the worst we 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.050
 dies it's not serious we'll have done already 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.070
 not bad all and our clubs still we can 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.950
 see the power of this laser level 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.160
 so he'll get to clean everything up and 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.150
 come to resuscitate us so I think that 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.230
 you'll have zoom in at the beginning of this 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.670
 video I intend to send seven this record 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.120
 I think because I had to 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.030
 search it is today so what 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:00.980
 world record 100 mastodon on the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:02.880
 map bild has the good for us and 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.230
 I hope I miss him because 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040
 really that's not the super fact to say 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.480
 because it's chains 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.100
 which must be kept for 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.980
 me so it's real pleasure to see 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.750
 one of my videos of them so here's one 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.520
 arrives at the end of this video for 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.610
 those who would not believe me on the fact 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.170
 I have I have not used juggernaut 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.110
 throughout the party that my colleagues 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.910

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.670
