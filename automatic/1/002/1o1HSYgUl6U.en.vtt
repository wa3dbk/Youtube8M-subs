so they don't swivel but then it's got

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.159 
so they don't swivel but then it's got
this<00:04:11.580> thing<00:04:12.470> which<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.590> really<00:04:13.950> kind<00:04:14.159> of<00:04:14.280> cool

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.289 

then<00:04:19.169> plugging<00:04:19.470> an<00:04:19.680> extension<00:04:20.220> cord<00:04:20.250> onto<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
then plugging an extension cord onto the

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:33.230 
then plugging an extension cord onto the
side<00:04:21.600> here<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:24.180> got<00:04:25.430> these<00:04:26.430> lights<00:04:30.110> as<00:04:32.240> a

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
side here and it's got these lights as a

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:43.340 
side here and it's got these lights as a
little<00:04:33.570> workstation<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:36.510> camera<00:04:42.320> isn't<00:04:43.320> that

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
little workstation the camera isn't that

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.670 
little workstation the camera isn't that
cool<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:45.600> we've<00:04:45.810> got<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:49.580> light<00:04:50.580> up<00:04:50.820> there

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
cool so we've got that light up there

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.400 
cool so we've got that light up there
and<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.190> opposite<00:04:53.669> side<00:04:54.199> we've<00:04:55.199> got<00:04:55.380> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
and on the opposite side we've got to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.500 
and on the opposite side we've got to
that<00:04:55.650> light<00:04:55.949> right<00:04:56.220> there<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.760> these<00:04:57.180> lights

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
that light right there and these lights

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:05.469 
that light right there and these lights
can<00:04:57.720> swivel<00:04:58.820> and<00:05:00.530> they<00:05:01.530> have<00:05:01.820> bright<00:05:03.260> off<00:05:04.340> and

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
can swivel and they have bright off and

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.990 
can swivel and they have bright off and
dim<00:05:07.639> so<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.830> little<00:05:10.860> brighter<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.820> the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
dim so it's a little brighter and the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.120 
dim so it's a little brighter and the
camera<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.570> camera<00:05:12.780> adjusts<00:05:13.349> to<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:13.950> it's

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
camera the camera adjusts to it so it's

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.920 
camera the camera adjusts to it so it's
kind<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.370> hard<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.610> see<00:05:14.849> the<00:05:15.599> difference

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
kind of hard to see the difference

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.370 
kind of hard to see the difference
between<00:05:15.990> bright<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.650> dim<00:05:16.800> but<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.900> got<00:05:19.050> pegs

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
between bright and dim but it's got pegs

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.140 
between bright and dim but it's got pegs
in<00:05:19.740> there<00:05:19.919> so<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.099> can<00:05:20.280> put<00:05:20.430> in<00:05:20.550> some<00:05:20.760> shelving

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
in there so I can put in some shelving

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.310 
in there so I can put in some shelving
in<00:05:21.360> there<00:05:23.300> that's<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.510> it's<00:05:24.750> just<00:05:24.930> really<00:05:25.080> kind

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
in there that's it it's just really kind

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.820 
in there that's it it's just really kind
