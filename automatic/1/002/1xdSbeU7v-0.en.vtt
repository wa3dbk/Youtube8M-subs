into the corner and now all the way up
the<00:01:56.440> hill<00:01:56.470> straight<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.729> next<00:01:57.970> corner

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.669 

riding<00:02:03.520> with<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.880> GT<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.600> very<00:02:05.380> very

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
riding with a GT is very very

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.910 
riding with a GT is very very
comfortable<00:02:06.009> an<00:02:06.899> even<00:02:07.899> bigger<00:02:08.229> advantage

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
comfortable an even bigger advantage

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.610 
comfortable an even bigger advantage
however<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.820> fact<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.360> extreme<00:02:11.050> torques

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
however is the fact that extreme torques

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.699 
however is the fact that extreme torques
are<00:02:11.920> avoided<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.090> system<00:02:13.480> operates<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.380> lot

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
are avoided the system operates a lot

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.340 
are avoided the system operates a lot
more<00:02:15.040> efficient<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.760> therefore<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.989> battery

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
more efficient and therefore the battery

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.310 
more efficient and therefore the battery
capacity<00:02:17.700> gives<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:18.940> much<00:02:19.420> bigger<00:02:19.840> riding

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
capacity gives you a much bigger riding

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.900 
capacity gives you a much bigger riding
