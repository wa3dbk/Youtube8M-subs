00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.420
 and 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.740
 what's new gamers today I bring you 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.110
 a tutorial of the circuit with the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.180
 talking helicopter calls for a subscriber 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.970
 well here I leave it to go explaining a 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.849
 little bit more, the functions of the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.449
 controls but more than anything how to 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.820
 make 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.879
 trick is that you do not have to go through the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.360
 center of the yellow circles but to 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.720
 get close 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.880
 good as you will see - I guess 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.100
 you know how at least the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.350
 controls some tips I will continue giving 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.370
 throughout the video first take off 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.010
 put the view that more comfortable comes me 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.079
 I put this look forward 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 while we accelerate to butt 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.059
 and direct us towards the next 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.290
 point these are roughly straight 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.240
 to go down further we need to give the l 2 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.590
 simply that we do not give in any 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.570
 of the two and go forward is going to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.180
 go down gradually you take certain 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.520
 stability to go holding 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 the altitude we are giving touches to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 accelerator as to climb but neither 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 It is convenient to be all the time pressing the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.170
 around because if you do not come up 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.909
 more it becomes harder to find 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.360
 then it's good to go by giving him touches 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.860
 medium long taps and it's for 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.399
 these turns like this one a little bit 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.049
 closed for good we tip the 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.479
 helicopter in this case towards the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.179
 left and we turn with the tail rotor 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.280
 what would be in this case the l1 and 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.480
 we go down a bridge below 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.250
 controlling around 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the accelerator but that is not 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.030
 all the time with the post 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.790
 and patting soft things 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.680
 we tilt the green with tilt on tour 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.220
 the helicopter back you need more spin 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.050
 and already apply the tail rotor 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.610
 it gets out of control, I guess it's 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 go catching the roll and I do not either 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.750
 be no expert but we are going 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 near in this is one of the most 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.520
 complicated of the turn because it is very 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.730
 closed a bow and we put a lot 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.590
 Tail rotor 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.409
 almost we are left to go back to 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.000
 stabilize and forward here is not 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.760
 well all the time as I said before 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.450
 accelerating, accelerating, lifting, 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.129
 forward because accelerating as such is 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.069
 put the cyclic so-called 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.760
 ahead is worth the other what we were 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.760
 doing is 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.980
 and around if the l2 ascend and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.980
 descend 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.239
 here also, above all, is to look at what 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.239
 A little bit away the points 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.000
 in that direction without problems here 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.239
 we beat the helicopter a lot 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.370
 We put a lot of tail as many are left 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.400
 tails 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.310
 same 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.079
 the tail rotor and that playing with it to 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.260
 the time you play with the inclination of the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.510
 helicopter so you do not get out of control 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.400
 here you are leaving accelerating done in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.050
 nose upwards to brake 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.730
 helicopter the ale 2 to download 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.600
 what I wanted to do a little fast 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.580
 and it has been a somewhat abrupt landing 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.930
 but let's take the roll, either 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.470
 of helicopter trapping 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.090
 less 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.110
 we created gold medal either has 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.110
 cost too much 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.379
 but, well, I guess when you see them, 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.200
 staying more with the roll of how it 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.959
 behave in the helicopter if you have 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.840
 any doubt or with anything about 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.489
 of the video do you think that some other good does not 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.430
 you have more to leave to me in comments 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.860
 by private message as you want and I 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.659
 Well, if I can, I say hello 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.349
 thanks for watching me and continue enjoying 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.349
 the great game
