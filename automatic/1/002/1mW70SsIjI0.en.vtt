 hello to all you would find 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.500
 on the plateau of paris turf tv for 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.990
 your daily received five out of five the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 missions of the quinté plus and 5-5 for 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.320
 accompany me today forgiveness Eric 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.070
 gosselin hello eric sallé philippe 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.810
 mangeard back 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 then direction auteuil in the habit 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's sunday the price jean laumain 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 a test for 5 years and over 4300 m 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 steeples defects we know by heart 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 in this banana let's say it takes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.410
 resume the line in my opinion of the price 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 cocoa we find almost the ten 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.780
 first to date there is only one small flat 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 the terrain will certainly be heavier 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 this time it's clear and we're 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.910
 still at the end of the season 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.170
 it's the last Sunday in auteuil 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 so a little tired a little bit of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 so fatigue the coolness in my opinion a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 certain asset top of the arms renato 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 major accomplishes precisely to have by 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.750
 report to your selection if you have 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 the advertisements the horses that were 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.530
 well cheat listen and listen well me 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.590
 I put in mind the number 15 bobology 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 the xiii which for 2 oklahoma rings 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 seven the 5 coteaux sweety the 8 sir gallo 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.500
 the aforementioned kara 12/13 off the island 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 and the 3 a wave ok regarding your 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.790
 favorite number 15 sailing wolf 100% on 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.930
 the course a victory an accessit and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.000
 this victory was in the price 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.350
 mandara end of september is enough 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.790
 logical to this weight of placing it in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 head down and its shape 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.439
 finally these two form between mid-May 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.670
 these two good races on the course 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.030
 it was precisely these last two 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310
 racing 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.079
 so here we go 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.189
 quality level level because the cases the 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.689
 forms all that we can not too much 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.850
 cards and he just finds love because 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.950
 with four kilos more he is very 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.140
 well placed the last time his last 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.820
 kilometer I liked it a lot I think 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.549
 really it's really here on the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.659
 rising he proved he had nothing to 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.549
 to prove precisely in the big 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.360
 disabilities 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.890
 it's a theoretical first chance 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.149
 this is the basis of the race to points 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.590
 base in the race we will talk about it 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.450
 precisely the second is the xiii 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.579
 people 80% success on the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.640
 course 8 accessits in ten outings but 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.509
 however still not successful 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.920
 can maybe go up there for this 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.909
 it's impressive when it's 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.110
 maybe for this time because the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.819
 last time precisely he was at a 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.709
 neckline bottom of my favorite vauban lodge 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.569
 so it will really be a story 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.549
 course of note that even though 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.610
 Yom Kippur will be favored by 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.599
 the heavier terrain so like 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.160
 you said the steeple d'auteuil 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.060
 it's really a specialist of 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.560
 groups by monitors and he loves it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.540
 last time it was still 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.310
 just his second race after a 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.019
 back so we can really assume 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.540
 that he's really cool he ran 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.120
 that twice this fall he's on the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.230
 rising 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.970
 good before the shot this is a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.129
 print business if you wish 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 to put at the head perfectly the means 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.159
 to win they deserve it need nothing 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.720
 hide you eric placed on November 15 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.250
 thirteen months I placed my thesis in front of 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.840
 cardboard that's how it is 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.879
 really the two shows of the race in 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.709
 third position a female number 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.150
 2 oklahoma seven who stays on a 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.110
 excellent third place was in the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.849
 olry roederer price 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.319
 she was supplemented for the occasion 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.400
 we will not say everything is said or almost 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.420
 but that means a lot 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.519
 to say a lot of things that means 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.319
 many ben good the price léo their 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.970
 mistakes we know it's on them so 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.920
 this time so the man at seven 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.329
 return on the steeple on the style 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.129
 eiffel has more really to do it's 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.019
 to beg her evidence since she had 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.430
 won on the course in May in 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.170
 sticky terrain in front of extreme south 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.000
 extreme south which is still at the beginning 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.769
 of the georges courtois Sunday 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 if I did not know who this is, if you are 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.819
 a bit the level so I think that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.680
 jean louis guay takes full advantage of 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.090
 form 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.609
 oklahoma seven good bah here is course at a 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.579
 week so we can assume anyway 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.239
 that she has recovered well from her efforts 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.950
 braving the curfew 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.329
 supplemented it's true guys no no 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.859
 we're going to dismiss it's a goal 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.260
 it makes sense that she concluded 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.510
 the arrival of this test in the fourth 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.459
 position number 5 hillside sweety who 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 stays on two good successes it was a 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.099
 gain and success auteuil which 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.359
 correspond to its passage in the 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.370
 boxes of yann marie porzier since 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.169
 before he was super jehan bertran of 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.329
 balanda so we'll be wary because 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.879
 the porzier form the section of the machous 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.069
 the form posiez associated with stéphane 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.040
 bourgault hacker a young jockey who 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.609
 maybe show a future crack in 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.699
 coming years 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.500
 um me sweety knife me a lot 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.060
 impressed them just the two 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.220
 last time so certainly it was a 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.319
 lower level it's clear certainly 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.730
 it was courses it was auteuil the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.440
 steeple but on routes less 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.630
 selective so that's it's the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.220
 little flat in quotation marks now 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.549
 I trust that's the form 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.410
 mail to koto wished we know it 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.790
 try a bet but in my opinion he knows this 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.560
 he does and he does not see like that 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.200
 it is clear we will trust him 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.390
 in fifth position number 8 sir 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.980
 gallo his only attempt on the steeplechase 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.330
 d'auteuil resulted in a third 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.190
 place was in the price andré of her 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.300
 it was not the same distance far 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.770
 housing will not be disturbed 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.270
 and especially it's jean paul 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.540
 gallorini there too fund can not 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.280
 remove 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.570
 jean paul gallorini right now with 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.610
 Jacques Ricou it's a little ticket 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.110
 winner of the fall so I saw myself 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.130
 badly still removed sir gallo the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.560
 last time it was the big 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.780
 steeple-chase d'enghien forgiveness inevitably 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.880
 a level a little raised for him all to 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.530
 did when he was third of the price 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.990
 andré adel I believe it was unless 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.160
 of three lengths of a look so a 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.750
 look and depart Sunday 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.740
 I did not keep for a simple and 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.730
 good reason it's going to be his 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.290
 sixth race of autumn 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.430
 it is a veil so soffiati that I 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.840
 closes my logic of freshness for 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.430
 here I preferred to make the impasse 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.630
 now a look makes the finish there 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.400
 there is nothing to say either yes especially 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.440
 that a look was engaged in courteous and 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.390
 the warning so after that but 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.650
 it's true here is my a little doubt about 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.540
 the freshness of a look but it will take 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.860
 close figra millions of games ds that 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.720
 give good luck to Sir Gallo I 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.669
 think ok listen to me why not 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.919
 you must never leave a gallorini 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.660
 from a quinté + 5 5 to auteuil 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.610
 what's that in the minute and reims and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.350
 now with number 3 a wave 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.090
 since gilles ointment to play a 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.010
 phone etienne leenders who we 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.840
 talk about the chances of this number 3 a 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.060
 wave to listen to him sir linder this 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400
 you are going to present a wave in the 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.169
 Sunday quinté at auteuil how 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:50.240
 do you judge his campaign so far? 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:52.540
 of autumn in this kind of race and the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.540
 value 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.849
 ah yes because for you it's going to be a 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.229
 big advantage with the terrain that is 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.580
 became more painful okay I saw 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.139
 as you intend to do 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.229
 to put him blinders 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.229
 Australian 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:26.620
 ah yes okay very well so 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:33.729
 and the fact that she's carrying 72 kg is not 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:36.580
 too disturbing revin okay so 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.319
 so with the Australian blinders and 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.550
 the softer ground you think 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:45.009
 that she can this time show herself 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:47.500
 more percussive talents as we will have 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.889
 understood gilles quite a lot of friends summary them 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.279
 and yesterday a pitch that announces is 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.719
 normally rather heavy 72 kg 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.479
 do not worry his coach 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.099
 we will be wary we do not feel it even 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.330
 to play wins but we will see each other 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.310

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.199
 fifteen fifth place one is author to 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.639
 4300 meters there may be some 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.080
 racing incidents in value 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.610
 intrinsically one can not ban it for 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.240
 a 4th place but better it will be 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.770

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.909

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.710
