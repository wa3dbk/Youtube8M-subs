00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.459
 another new product 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.889
 so he will have a huge impact 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.889
 our way of our communication 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.320
 in 2007 and he himself invented the telephone 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.920
 in 2008 and iphone 3g and 3gs faster work 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 forward same networks and this is a revolutionary ex stor m 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.530
 3 thousand May ninth and another 3 6 became in two 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.000
 times faster and purchased what new 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.020
 features like video recording for two thousand 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.480
 the tenth iphone 4 is the biggest move 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.769
 forward since the first model we 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.570
 present surprisingly likely 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.430
 display and we bring in the video 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.850
 calls in the world 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.140
 we call it and our stein 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 it will change our way of communicating 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 forever and ever 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.450
 the first time I used 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.450
 finestein calls I was shocked 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.790
 if u like this is awesome 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.290
 fascinated disappeared binding people 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.530
 technologies 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.930
 Now I think about my children through 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.740
 seven years will be held in college forest can 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.580
 call and see them look into your eyes and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.220
 see how not really did 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.930
 safe 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080
 what makes it even better is it 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.600
 able to switch with 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.260
 front to the back camera so you 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.070
 can you show that musa is what you see the deputy 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.710
 and since it is mobile to the phone you will have 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.600
 opportunity to talk 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.070
 decades acted files and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.410
 every time i use it i don't 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.070
 I can't stop smiling 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.790
 believe that it is real what it is and 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.160
 the truth is happening 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.910
 another real moment 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.399
 fund disturbing in the new field 4 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.619
 This is a native display and the display is the largest 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.099
 resolution from ever installed on 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.140
 phone plus 20 and six pixels per inch 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.979
 you get four times as much as a third 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.970
 than before 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.930
 so instead of vagueness 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.029
 individual cases 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.969
 you get a smooth shape and tone pleasant 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.619
 as if held in their hands 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.869
 printed page and level of detail 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.619
 just incredible another moment which 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.059
 adds clarity and clarity this points 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.189
 ches lamination is very accurate 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.669
 technical process in which it is laminated 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.129
 glass covering disk thereby 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.289
 excluding both fractions of color on her care 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.079
 this disk them improving it 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.719
 clarity was spent a lot 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.009
 effort besides we used 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.649
 technology a and arrival and analog backlight 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.569
 so that you always have a bright and lively 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.109
 picture despla yanaev he is stunning best 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.409
 details than ever could see on 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.409
 any such device 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.599
 the text is just perfect 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.760
 iphone 4 multi task for all applications 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.659
 we can quickly switch between 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.400
 applications and all the same as it is 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.689
 it was before 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.739
 if you are the same as me then you 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.269
 surely a lot of programs on your 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.030
 choosing a foundation 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.370
 and we would like to conveniently group them 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.880
 finding them that way doesn't work 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.830
 batch select apps and 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.090
 drag it to another folder 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.130
 automatically created and will 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.140
 be called according to the type of application 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.660
 which will transport to 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.010
 Pola tones and iphone 4s amazing 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.319
 effectively you can see all the messages 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.660
 from your knockouts in one folder outgoing 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.880
 also you can group your 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.400
 communication by subjects 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.400
 and work with one topic entirely 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.459
 photos taken on a five-megapixel 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.110
 the camera looks just great 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.780
 also now the phone has 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.800
 be held Parisian so you 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.590
 be able to shoot even in low light 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.190
 all plus the camera shoots 723 3 4 leaders 30 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.429
 frames per second 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.929
 and now you can not only shoot but also 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.489
 edit your video right on your 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.659
 Alphonse A and Sea 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.369
 ah background for the user is 

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:21.589
 just like usability for 

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.910
 which stand strong technology 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.259
 Katya 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.499
 and all these amazing 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.439
 programs handles so 4 chip 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.909
 specially designed 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.659
 small with high speed and 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.080
 efficiency 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.389
 it's really very small 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.050
 turtles 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.409
 the only thing we did was big 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.759
 battery 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.900
 iPhone 4 and works 40 percent more 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.499
 time in talk mode we started 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.659
 completely different goals we wanted 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.559
 make it more powerful we wanted 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:53.910
 add as many features as possible 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.240
 and at the same time we wanted to make it 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.499
 smaller and thinner 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.079
 and this leads us to truly 

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:02.930
 awesome and innovative 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.169
 we have developed a completely new type 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.530
 stainless steel which after 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.820
 The processing remains incredibly durable and 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.850
 at the same time neat and accurate 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.820
 I remember the rest of the framework is he 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.280
 constantly but at the same time it gives us 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.249
 more space inside 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.539
 and above this also we have developed especially 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.539
 expired which is 30 times stronger than plastic 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.009
 This glass is not used 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.009
 only on the front panel but also on the back 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.479
 wants the quality of the material exactly with 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.259
 manufacturing high technology 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.669
 all this will remain relevant when 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.669
 hold it in your hand 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.909
 although the search engines only new 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.629
 function this will be in amazing new 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:55.569
 they are stock 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.240
 but the fact that they appeared diligently display 5 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.099
 megapixel camera recording 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.620
 brown video a 4 chip big fights 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.860
 more subtle and device it and 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.460
 change everything again 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.960
 it will change everything
