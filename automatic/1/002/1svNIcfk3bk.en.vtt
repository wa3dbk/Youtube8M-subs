 it is an indispensable recipe is part 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.210
 of the good speed bump kitchen is simple but 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.129
 that has to be well done with the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.240
 Sausage combines perfectly on 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.240
 everything well seasoned or it could well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.190
 Serve with bread or french fries but 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.180
 I prefer the potato salad here the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.830
 we eat at least once a week 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.940
 culinary discovery 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.480
 I like it a lot but it has a flavor 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.480
 very different from the Japanese food 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.410
 It's a new flavor but I love it 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.579
 in the market located opposite the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.700
 salad the violet variety called bit 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 corn or red emma 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.769
 the first recipe written in German 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.540
 comes from a monastery in austria 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.819
 there the steamed potatoes were cooked 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.310
 dish that is described with a lot 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.230
 detail and it is mentioned as a delight 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.810
 for the palate was the year 1621 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.000
 and back to the restaurant luv in the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
 proprietary Ãºrsula cautiously prepares her 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.209
 salad with vinegar salt oil and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.209
 Pepper 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.440
 the important thing to prepare it the way 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.890
 speed is spraying the broth on the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.890
 salad 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.390
 then the ingredients can be chosen 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.530
 or not 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.030
 perfect 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.580
 The catering service is healthy jor 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.620
 specialized in potato salad provides 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.050
 to restaurants and parties wholesalers 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.600
 private despite being produced in 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.470
 dough his salad was awarded and not 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.470
 just for its taste 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.310
 we do not boil the potatoes like 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.650
 did the housewives until now but 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.180
 that we steam them up so they keep 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.080
 all its nutrients and substances 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.180
 aromatic outgames either at home or 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.800
 homemade the potato salad can not 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.800
 miss at any German party 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.430
 If I really like how I am Peruvian and the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.730
 potatoes come from my country but we do not 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.340
 we eat them in salad like here 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.360
 the recipe is quite a surprise for me 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.360
 It is very good 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.750
 I notice that it has a lemon or lime flavor 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.580
 what makes it very special 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.159
 it's very tasty 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.319
 potato salad an old plate with 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.470
