00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
can understand the reasons why WWE might

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.770 
can understand the reasons why WWE might
force<00:00:44.129> THQ<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> bring<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.149> those<00:00:45.329> changes

force THQ to bring in those changes
especially<00:00:46.649> since<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> meant<00:00:47.160> PG<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
especially since the meant PG and you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.760 
especially since the meant PG and you
don't<00:00:48.329> generally<00:00:48.930> say<00:00:49.079> male<00:00:49.320> versus<00:00:49.739> female

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
don't generally say male versus female

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
don't generally say male versus female
matches<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.670> TV<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.539> surely<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> comes

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
matches on TV but surely when it comes

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.229 
matches on TV but surely when it comes
to<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> video<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.489> should<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.879> able<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.120> do

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to a video game you should be able to do

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.119 
to a video game you should be able to do
those<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.930> matches<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.320> live<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
those kind of matches and live out the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
those kind of matches and live out the
things<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.640> can't<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.360> TV<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.530> if

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
things that you can't see on TV so if

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
things that you can't see on TV so if
the<00:00:58.890> reason<00:00:59.219> behind<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> WWE

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the reason behind this is that the WWE

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
the reason behind this is that the WWE
don't<00:01:01.410> want<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.829> their<00:01:02.070> Superstars

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
don't want to see their Superstars

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.369 
don't want to see their Superstars
beating<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> Divas<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.229> like

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
beating up the Divas then I would like

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.960 
beating up the Divas then I would like
to<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> other<00:01:05.010> gender<00:01:05.339> option<00:01:05.760> brought

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to see the other gender option brought

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.820 
to see the other gender option brought
back<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.080> least<00:01:07.110> create<00:01:07.590> some

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
back in so we can at least create some

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.830 
back in so we can at least create some
custom<00:01:08.100> Superstars<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.939> divas<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
custom Superstars and divas with that of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
custom Superstars and divas with that of
that<00:01:09.990> gender<00:01:10.320> who<00:01:10.680> would<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:10.920> able<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> fight

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that gender who would then able to fight

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
that gender who would then able to fight
any<00:01:11.790> gender<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.540> any<00:01:12.780> belt<00:01:13.080> meaning<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.860> could

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
any gender for any belt meaning we could

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
any gender for any belt meaning we could
finally<00:01:14.280> create<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> likes<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> China<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
finally create the likes of China and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
finally create the likes of China and
have<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.320> against<00:01:16.740> divas<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
have a go up against divas and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
have a go up against divas and
superstars<00:01:18.060> whilst<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:19.229> stopping<00:01:19.619> people

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
superstars whilst also stopping people

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
superstars whilst also stopping people
from<00:01:20.159> using<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.520> superstar<00:01:21.000> in-game<00:01:21.479> models

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
from using the superstar in-game models

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
from using the superstar in-game models
against<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> diva<00:01:22.799> models<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.790> then

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
against the diva models so then

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
against the diva models so then
hopefully<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.290> would<00:01:25.439> satisfy<00:01:25.619> both<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
hopefully that would satisfy both the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.609 
hopefully that would satisfy both the
WWE<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.180> protecting<00:01:27.659> their<00:01:27.810> in-game<00:01:28.200> sounds
