 I 'm giving it away with a free campaign now 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.530
 There seems to be a god ability in this Son Goku 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.620
 If you look at how the back 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.810
 The hero's hero energy of the god 's first round only hits the battle power and improves two or more 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.380
 It has the effect of disappearing 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.250

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.260

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.670
 ラ ッ カ ー Lacquer such feeling at the end of the first round 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.720
 If the round is less than two battles that his team received in that round 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.070
 I power is +5 II a persistent 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.550

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.300
 Like this 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.300
