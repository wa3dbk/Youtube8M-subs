00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.830
 variant for this tablet blog.de we are 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.889
 at the booth of samsung and we have that 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.860
 samsung galaxy note 10.1 the follower 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.090
 the last model last year 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.509
 Presented will be at an event 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.369
 the ifa 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.320
 now have it on the ifa together with 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.439
 shown the note 3 and we want us 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.310
 the reissue of the 10.1 inch tablets times 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.020
 take a closer look 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.060
 We still have a 10 1 inch 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.649
 display, however, is the resolution 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.109
 from 2560 x 1600 pixel is so one 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.329
 pretty high resolution and the display 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.309
 also can be quite nice, we see 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.339
 was mentally well represented the pimples 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.070
 be neat and I like that 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.079
 every case in it we now have a 2 3 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.149
 ghz core processor along with three 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.489
 gigabytes of memory and 16 megabytes 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.499
 but 16 megabyte flash memory can 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.269
 but micro sd card slot arbitrary 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.070
 be extended and possibly will 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.470
 another speaker at the options 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.140
 Give galaxy note 10.1 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.840
 Last summer 32 gb expanded there 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.420
 I'm not sure yet in the calls 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.740
 Articles or in the description 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.659
 as I said also three gigabytes 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 memory runs on it android 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.689
 4.3 jelly bean just like the note 3 and 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.140
 on it the typical places of here 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.840
 samsung with and wisely with and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.679
 switch 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.210
 some of the customization adjustments 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.979
 Collections are of course interesting 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 especially in connection with the style 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.109
 he is independently supplied 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.090
 this includes a few new s not 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.829
 functions, for example, air command 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.319
 if you have the stylus huber over that 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.630
 Display discount and press the button 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.200
 then opens air command and there you have 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.060
 to you a number of possibilities 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.159
 functions that you can complete on 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.159
 best I still find 18 million 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 there will now be a notebook 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.960
 He accepted and just follow you 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 anyone he or she gives you the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.899
 address you want to write it down and 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.429
 then to the take off place and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.220
 you just write the address in 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.900
 I only have one case now 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.070
 berlin but we can also get an accurate 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.350
 give roads 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.610
 together with the house number and so on 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.860
 further discussed 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.140
 on this button here and there you can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.710
 for example the on google maps 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.210
 send 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.370
 but it is also possible if one 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.170
 phone number have written down 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.880
 to send that directly to the phone 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.240
 but maybe also to the contacts 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.180
 the sms or e-mail or mt browser 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.980
 we'll do that with maps and 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.550
 open google maps for that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.610
 and then it will go to berlin or 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.630
 other case after the corresponding one 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.730
 corresponding address searched 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.440
 okay there on google maps on the device 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.200
 never started on paper 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.670
 this will not be done now but me 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.080
 think that must be the same again 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.150
 make so that you also see that there 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.150
 So it really works 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.550
 have here on he will come 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.380
 started was always pick 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.330
 berlin that now have the back 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.330
 then send it off 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.689
 and then the functioning is to 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.329
 you are now looking for berlin 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.900
 and as I said then I would one 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.900
 phone number 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.670
 phones work and so on 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.980
 most interesting features with the stylus 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.560
 what has also been improved is the multi 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.599
 window itself was yes with the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.860
 first galaxy note samples ever 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.390
 first introduced and now a bit 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.970
 it is possible to improve two 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.970
 each open chat for example 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.460
 that again 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.020
 there is at the twice chat side by side 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.040
 and we can now work with two people 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.330
 At the same time, however, they would have to 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.860
 back and forth to move 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.040
 the same applies to the file browser 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.390
 and so on, well that will be some 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.200
 new software features with the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.200
 galaxy 10.1 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.730
 2014/2015 edition has been introduced 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.110
 let's go around the tray we 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.940
 as I said the 10.1 inch display 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.520
 resolution 2,560 x 1,600 2.3 ghz quad 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.990
 processor around here we have a two 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.550
 megapixel webcam 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.340
 we have the three typical ones below 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.989
 have android buttons on this page 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.760
 We only have one speaker and one 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.250
 headphone input i hope that you can 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.250
 so extensions look down there 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.360
 then a micro-usb connection then 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.490
 we have here on the website one in 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.130
 of course, it will be chancellery as well 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.670
 a 3g or Lte variant is 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.710
 19 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.690
 as with the predecessor from then you take 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.340
 micro sd card slot and here again 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.870
 speaker and is located 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.330
 infrared sensor and then we have the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.010
 volume rocker a power button and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.170
 that was the back for his 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.390
 eight megapixel camera together with the 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.390
 led lightning and the design of how the 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.590
 note 3 in such a kind of imitation leather 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.450
 is not a real imitation leather 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.310
 as far as I know 1 800 plastic that one 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.889
 So it was a bit rum design 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.870
 plastic 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.340
 feels a bit artificial leather 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.509
 hand slides as well as at 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.819
 higher quality than the predecessor 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.860
 but it always appears , of course 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.499
 no ipad what the processing 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.860
 but significantly improved that 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.849
 the samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 old 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.590
 tradition 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.249
 I'm attacking tablet blog.de picture 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.249
 to see markus
