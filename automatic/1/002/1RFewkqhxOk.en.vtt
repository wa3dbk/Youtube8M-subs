I'm<00:00:38.870> just<00:00:39.050> gonna<00:00:39.200> wrap<00:00:39.500> this<00:00:39.770> down<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.670> about

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
I'm just gonna wrap this down to about

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.390 
I'm just gonna wrap this down to about
the<00:00:41.989> point<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.530> hook<00:00:42.680> or<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.309> then

the point in the hook or so and then
I'll<00:00:43.520> bring<00:00:43.700> it<00:00:43.879> back<00:00:44.120> up<00:00:44.150> just<00:00:44.690> creating<00:00:45.050> a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
I'll bring it back up just creating a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.650 
I'll bring it back up just creating a
little<00:00:45.230> bit<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.790> thread<00:00:46.790> base<00:00:47.030> there<00:00:47.390> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
little bit of a thread base there and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.270 
little bit of a thread base there and
then<00:00:47.780> I'll<00:00:47.900> leave<00:00:48.080> this<00:00:48.320> at<00:00:48.620> about<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
then I'll leave this at about the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.150 
then I'll leave this at about the
two-thirds<00:00:49.970> mark<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.630> hook<00:00:50.810> shank<00:00:51.100> now<00:00:52.100> I

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
two-thirds mark on the hook shank now I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.510 
two-thirds mark on the hook shank now I
can<00:00:52.460> tie<00:00:52.730> in<00:00:53.050> my<00:00:54.050> body<00:00:54.380> and<00:00:54.829> for<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.280> I'm

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
can tie in my body and for that I'm

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.150 
can tie in my body and for that I'm
going<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.700> use<00:00:55.940> just<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.360> piece<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.840> black<00:00:57.710> foam

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
going to use just a piece of black foam

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.060 
going to use just a piece of black foam
cut<00:00:58.940> into<00:00:59.210> about<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.450> quarter<00:00:59.899> inch<00:00:59.930> strip<00:01:00.500> I'm

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
cut into about a quarter inch strip I'm

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.630 
cut into about a quarter inch strip I'm
going<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.309> trim<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.450> have<00:01:02.780> a

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
going to trim this so that I have a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.020 
going to trim this so that I have a
point<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:05.030> tie<00:01:05.930> into<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:07.220> I'm<00:01:07.310> gonna<00:01:07.490> lay<00:01:07.700> down

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
point to tie into and I'm gonna lay down

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.100 
point to tie into and I'm gonna lay down
just<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.509> little<00:01:08.540> drop<00:01:09.380> or<00:01:09.619> two<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:10.750> zappa<00:01:11.750> gap

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
just a little drop or two of zappa gap

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.730 
just a little drop or two of zappa gap
and<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.610> will<00:01:13.820> help<00:01:14.119> that<00:01:14.619> seed<00:01:15.619> itself<00:01:17.740> so

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
and this will help that seed itself so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.880 
and this will help that seed itself so
just<00:01:19.190> start<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:21.310> tack<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.340> up<00:01:22.819> a<00:01:22.940> little<00:01:23.119> bit

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
just start to tack that up a little bit

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:33.860 
just start to tack that up a little bit
and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:25.700> can<00:01:25.910> tie<00:01:26.209> it<00:01:26.270> into<00:01:26.569> place

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.690 

you<00:01:34.870> know<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:36.180> trim<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.390> back<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:38.200> about

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
you know just trim this back to about

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200 
you know just trim this back to about
the<00:01:39.700> end<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.300> overall<00:01:40.720> hook<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.700> I'll

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
the end of the overall hook and I'll

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.600 
the end of the overall hook and I'll
just<00:01:43.390> set<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.690> on<00:01:44.229> top<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:44.680> it'll<00:01:45.100> start<00:01:45.430> to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
just set that on top and it'll start to

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.990 
just set that on top and it'll start to
set<00:01:45.850> up<00:01:46.060> just<00:01:46.869> makes<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.200> little<00:01:47.380> bit<00:01:47.500> more

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
set up just makes a little bit more

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.680 
set up just makes a little bit more
structurally<00:01:49.000> sound<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:55.030> right<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.570> that

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
structurally sound all right and that

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.719 
structurally sound all right and that
was<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.990> starts<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.560> dry<00:01:56.800> then<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.130> can<00:01:57.430> begin

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
was that starts to dry then I can begin

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.620 
was that starts to dry then I can begin
to<00:01:58.060> make<00:01:58.840> my<00:01:59.670> wing<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.000> for<00:02:01.150> that<00:02:01.300> I'm<00:02:01.509> going

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
to make my wing and for that I'm going

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.279 
to make my wing and for that I'm going
to<00:02:01.690> use<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:03.000> healthcare<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.570> health<00:02:04.780> care<00:02:04.990> I'm

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
to use a healthcare and health care I'm

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.169 
to use a healthcare and health care I'm
just<00:02:05.350> going<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.590> take<00:02:05.830> off<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> clump<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:09.179> little

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
just going to take off a clump a little

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.420 
just going to take off a clump a little
bit<00:02:10.300> different<00:02:10.720> than<00:02:11.380> an<00:02:11.500> elk<00:02:11.800> hair<00:02:11.950> caddis

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
bit different than an elk hair caddis

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.120 
bit different than an elk hair caddis
where<00:02:12.640> you're<00:02:12.850> relying<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.380> elk<00:02:14.650> hair<00:02:14.980> to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
where you're relying on the elk hair to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.710 
where you're relying on the elk hair to
keep<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.430> afloat<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.300> buoyant

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
keep it afloat this is pretty buoyant

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.199 
keep it afloat this is pretty buoyant
with<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.410> foam<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.040> floats<00:02:18.280> better<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
with the foam so it floats better and

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.670 
with the foam so it floats better and
that<00:02:19.330> being<00:02:19.570> said<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.019> don't<00:02:20.140> need<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.470> use

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
that being said you don't need to use

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.699 
that being said you don't need to use
quite<00:02:21.100> as<00:02:21.250> much<00:02:21.510> l<00:02:22.510> care<00:02:22.930> with<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.380> as<00:02:23.590> you

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
quite as much l care with this as you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.810 
quite as much l care with this as you
would<00:02:23.890> for<00:02:24.900> an<00:02:25.900> elk<00:02:26.200> hair<00:02:26.440> katha<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.310> just<00:02:27.640> put

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
would for an elk hair katha so just put

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.520 
would for an elk hair katha so just put
this<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.150> my<00:02:28.269> stacker<00:02:30.030> give<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.150> some<00:02:31.360> taps<00:02:32.140> to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
this in my stacker give it some taps to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.430 
this in my stacker give it some taps to
align<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.040> tips<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.959> then<00:02:34.959> I'll<00:02:35.110> measure

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
align the tips and then I'll measure

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.500 
align the tips and then I'll measure
this<00:02:35.800> out<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.549> want<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.390> a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
this out and I want it to be just a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.610 
this out and I want it to be just a
little<00:02:37.690> bit<00:02:37.959> longer<00:02:39.450> than<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.510> foam<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:41.530> I'm

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
little bit longer than the foam so I'm

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.530 
little bit longer than the foam so I'm
