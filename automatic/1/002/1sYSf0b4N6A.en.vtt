00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.200 

here's<00:00:02.500> how<00:00:02.710> we<00:00:02.770> built<00:00:03.219> our<00:00:03.460> super<00:00:03.850> adobe

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.210 
here's how we built our super adobe

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.980 
here's how we built our super adobe
building

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.260 

we<00:00:08.830> laid<00:00:09.010> out<00:00:09.160> the<00:00:09.190> design

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.200 

we<00:00:17.140> dug<00:00:17.380> that<00:00:17.560> ditch<00:00:17.860> down<00:00:18.310> about<00:00:18.640> a<00:00:18.700> wolf<00:00:18.940> foot

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
we dug that ditch down about a wolf foot

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.120 
we dug that ditch down about a wolf foot
and<00:00:19.420> allowed<00:00:19.960> for<00:00:19.990> our<00:00:20.289> first<00:00:20.560> layer<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:20.830> be

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
and allowed for our first layer to be

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.390 
and allowed for our first layer to be
laid<00:00:22.230> finding<00:00:23.230> dirt<00:00:23.439> wasn't<00:00:23.800> too<00:00:23.920> difficult

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
laid finding dirt wasn't too difficult

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.820 
laid finding dirt wasn't too difficult
because<00:00:24.550> we<00:00:24.849> needed<00:00:25.180> a<00:00:25.240> future<00:00:25.599> pond<00:00:25.900> so<00:00:26.680> we

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
because we needed a future pond so we

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.999 
because we needed a future pond so we
began<00:00:27.160> digging<00:00:27.490> and<00:00:27.910> hauling<00:00:28.300> dirt<00:00:28.480> over<00:00:29.009> we

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
began digging and hauling dirt over we

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.920 
began digging and hauling dirt over we
anxiously<00:00:30.250> awaited<00:00:31.060> for<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.300> continuous

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
anxiously awaited for the continuous

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.420 
anxiously awaited for the continuous
sandbag<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.619> karai<00:00:37.199> roll<00:00:38.199> up<00:00:38.379> our<00:00:38.559> first<00:00:38.860> line

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
sandbag to karai roll up our first line

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.340 
sandbag to karai roll up our first line
got<00:00:39.910> some<00:00:40.090> measurement<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.600> take<00:00:40.809> first<00:00:41.050> but

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
got some measurement to take first but

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:53.070 
got some measurement to take first but
we're<00:00:41.470> pretty<00:00:41.620> close<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:52.210> measured<00:00:52.659> and<00:00:52.809> cut

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
we're pretty close we measured and cut

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.719 
we're pretty close we measured and cut
sections<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.890> be<00:00:53.920> filled<00:00:54.250> with<00:00:54.430> dirt<00:00:56.729> we

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
sections to be filled with dirt we

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.640 
sections to be filled with dirt we
experimented<00:00:58.239> first<00:00:58.690> by<00:00:58.930> dampening<00:00:59.500> the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
experimented first by dampening the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.910 
experimented first by dampening the
water<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.280> trailer<00:01:01.290> later<00:01:02.290> on<00:01:02.500> we<00:01:02.739> found

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
water in the trailer later on we found

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.950 
water in the trailer later on we found
it<00:01:03.100> was<00:01:03.220> easier<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.879> water<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.360> ground<00:01:04.659> before

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
it was easier to water the ground before

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.910 
it was easier to water the ground before
we<00:01:05.229> dug<00:01:05.440> it<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:07.450> tried<00:01:07.869> several<00:01:08.320> different

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
we dug it up we tried several different

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.030 
we dug it up we tried several different
ways<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.490> fill<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.790> bags<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:11.530> determined<00:01:12.010> that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
ways to fill the bags we determined that

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.789 
ways to fill the bags we determined that
coffee<00:01:12.369> cans<00:01:12.790> worked<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.330> best

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.760 

each<00:01:21.490> layer<00:01:21.939> is<00:01:22.270> tamp<00:01:22.719> down<00:01:22.840> after<00:01:23.560> we've

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
each layer is tamp down after we've

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.639 
each layer is tamp down after we've
placed<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.579> wall

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.709 

we<00:01:29.649> laid<00:01:29.860> two<00:01:30.100> rows<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.429> barbed<00:01:31.000> wire<00:01:31.060> down

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
we laid two rows of barbed wire down

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:43.289 
we laid two rows of barbed wire down
between<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.350> layers<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.700> frames<00:01:42.969> that<00:01:43.119> we're

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
between the layers the frames that we're

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.529 
between the layers the frames that we're
going<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.479> be<00:01:43.569> using<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.520> bring<00:01:45.520> our<00:01:45.729> pad<00:01:46.209> or

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
going to be using to bring our pad or

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.319 
going to be using to bring our pad or
are<00:01:47.039> super<00:01:48.039> Adobe<00:01:48.399> right<00:01:48.579> up<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.209> it'll

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
are super Adobe right up to and it'll

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.910 
are super Adobe right up to and it'll
stack<00:01:49.569> right<00:01:49.719> up<00:01:49.840> against<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.619> then<00:01:50.770> we'll

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
stack right up against it and then we'll

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.039 
stack right up against it and then we'll
have<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.039> center<00:01:51.310> section<00:01:51.700> there<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.060> then

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
have a center section there and then

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.679 
have a center section there and then
just<00:01:53.319> continue<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.909> these<00:01:54.909> are<00:01:55.119> some<00:01:55.270> cleaning

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
just continue on these are some cleaning

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.100 
just continue on these are some cleaning
things<00:01:55.959> that<00:01:56.200> we're<00:01:56.349> using<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.950> cleat<00:01:58.110> between

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
things that we're using to cleat between

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.539 
things that we're using to cleat between
the<00:01:59.259> layers<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.799> that<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.009> have<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.220> little<00:02:00.369> bit

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
the layers so that I have a little bit

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.729 
the layers so that I have a little bit
of<00:02:00.640> nailers<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.209> nail<00:02:01.360> whatever<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.200> need<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.619> on

of nailers to nail whatever I need to on
the<00:02:02.770> inside<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.099> the<00:02:03.250> windows<00:02:03.989> we<00:02:04.989> place

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
the inside of the windows we place

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.589 
the inside of the windows we place
cleats<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:05.890> several<00:02:06.159> areas<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.970> levels<00:02:07.390> of

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
cleats it's several areas and levels of

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.089 
cleats it's several areas and levels of
the<00:02:07.929> structure<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.410> be<00:02:08.649> able<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.829> hang

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
the structure to be able to hang

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.819 
the structure to be able to hang
pictures<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.970> attach<00:02:10.869> different<00:02:11.230> sections

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
pictures and attach different sections

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.640 
pictures and attach different sections
of<00:02:11.950> walls<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.720> cleats<00:02:14.019> are<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.349> simple

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
of walls the the cleats are of a simple

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.650 
of walls the the cleats are of a simple
design<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> piece<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.120> ply<00:02:16.390> with

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
design with just a piece of ply with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.030 
design with just a piece of ply with
nails<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.140> would<00:02:17.230> actually<00:02:17.380> come<00:02:17.620> out<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.799> both

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
nails it would actually come out of both

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.220 
nails it would actually come out of both
sides<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.879> block<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.209> with<00:02:19.510> its<00:02:19.690> nail<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
sides and block up with its nail to it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440 
sides and block up with its nail to it
so<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:20.500> all<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.620> solid<00:02:21.160> piece<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:22.090> placed

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
so it's all one solid piece it's placed

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.580 
so it's all one solid piece it's placed
between<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.230> two<00:02:23.260> layers<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:25.120> rows<00:02:25.389> of<00:02:26.139> bags

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
between the two layers or rows of bags

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.650 
between the two layers or rows of bags
therefore<00:02:27.370> giving<00:02:27.609> us<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.819> nice<00:02:27.970> solid<00:02:28.450> surface

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
therefore giving us a nice solid surface

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.610 
therefore giving us a nice solid surface
to<00:02:29.049> nail<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:30.100> hanger<00:02:30.819> or<00:02:31.060> nail<00:02:31.359> up<00:02:31.569> use<00:02:32.319> for

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to nail a hanger or nail up use for

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.580 
to nail a hanger or nail up use for
backing<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:33.609> wall<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:34.810> be<00:02:34.900> able<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.079> go<00:02:35.200> next

backing for a wall to be able to go next

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.770 
backing for a wall to be able to go next
to<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.859> or<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.670> closet<00:02:36.910> area<00:02:37.389> we<00:02:37.600> did

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to it or in this closet area we did

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.599 
to it or in this closet area we did
place<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.380> cleat<00:02:38.709> at<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:38.950> bottom<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:39.459> able

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
place a cleat at the bottom to be able

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.759 
place a cleat at the bottom to be able
to<00:02:39.760> attach<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.389> bottom<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.959> doorway<00:02:41.470> for

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
to attach the bottom of the doorway for

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.430 
to attach the bottom of the doorway for
this<00:02:42.670> closet<00:02:43.209> but<00:02:43.480> I'd<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.750> glad<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.959> put<00:02:44.319> one

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
this closet but I'd be glad to put one

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.740 
this closet but I'd be glad to put one
at<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> top<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.250> there's<00:02:45.430> nothing<00:02:45.760> here<00:02:46.090> to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
at the top so there's nothing here to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.740 
at the top so there's nothing here to
compensate<00:02:47.380> for<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.709> used<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.340> rod<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:49.000> two

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
compensate for that I used a rod and two

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.440 
compensate for that I used a rod and two
threaded<00:02:50.079> bolts<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.829> just<00:02:51.489> kind<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.970> punched

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
threaded bolts and just kind of punched

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.740 
threaded bolts and just kind of punched
a<00:02:52.540> hole<00:02:52.660> right<00:02:52.690> through<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.910> layers<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.269> put

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
a hole right through the layers and put

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.870 
a hole right through the layers and put
two<00:02:55.930> big<00:02:56.079> washers<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.650> squeezed<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.519> right

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
two big washers and squeezed on right

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.069 
two big washers and squeezed on right
together<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.359> I<00:02:58.420> still<00:02:58.630> get<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.750> nice<00:02:58.900> solid

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
together so I still get a nice solid

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.830 
together so I still get a nice solid
surface<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.739> larder<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.489> way<00:03:00.639> though<00:03:00.849> we

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
surface the larder this way though we

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:12.569 
surface the larder this way though we
drove<00:03:02.079> rebar<00:03:02.620> down<00:03:02.650> for<00:03:03.340> added<00:03:03.700> strength<00:03:11.579> we

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
drove rebar down for added strength we

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.160 
drove rebar down for added strength we
put<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> arches

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
put in the arches

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
put in the arches
we<00:03:16.170> did<00:03:16.319> this<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.860> other<00:03:17.040> day<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.370> let<00:03:17.520> it

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
we did this one the other day and let it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.540 
we did this one the other day and let it
harden<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:19.380> we'll<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.650> another<00:03:19.830> one<00:03:19.980> that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
harden then we'll do another one that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.699 
harden then we'll do another one that
goes<00:03:20.700> over<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> top<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.290> I'll<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.530> more

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
goes over the top and then I'll do more

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.640 
goes over the top and then I'll do more
up<00:03:22.830> here<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.510> roof<00:03:30.720> couldn't<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:31.319> set<00:03:31.530> on

for fun we use bottles on the outside of
the<00:05:07.449> structure<00:05:07.749> just<00:05:08.849> get<00:05:09.849> membered<00:05:10.270> out<00:05:10.479> so

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
the structure just get membered out so

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:19.050 
the structure just get membered out so
we<00:05:10.839> can<00:05:11.020> fit<00:05:11.229> our<00:05:12.180> fallen

curiously and then this one here and I

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.770 
curiously and then this one here and I
just<00:05:27.250> what<00:05:27.730> go<00:05:27.880> ahead<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.300> cut<00:05:28.450> out<00:05:28.570> their

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
just what go ahead and cut out their

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.480 
just what go ahead and cut out their
lines<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.200> then<00:05:29.350> we'll<00:05:29.440> just<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:30.280> doesn't

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
lines and then we'll just it doesn't

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.010 
lines and then we'll just it doesn't
matter<00:05:30.760> how<00:05:30.940> big<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.330> get<00:05:31.480> the<00:05:31.600> hole<00:05:31.780> because

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
lines and cutting them out and when we

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.260 
lines and cutting them out and when we
put<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.500> windows<00:05:53.830> in<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.070> frames<00:05:54.430> all<00:05:54.760> that

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
put the windows in the frames all that

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.340 
put the windows in the frames all that
started<00:05:55.660> finishing<00:05:55.930> it<00:06:00.630> we<00:06:01.630> also<00:06:01.780> created

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
started finishing it we also created

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.600 
started finishing it we also created
bottle<00:06:02.950> windows<00:06:07.980> after<00:06:08.980> doing<00:06:09.280> large

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
bottle windows after doing large

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.760 
bottle windows after doing large
sections<00:06:10.180> of<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.450> cob<00:06:10.690> we<00:06:11.050> did<00:06:11.290> find<00:06:11.620> that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
sections of the cob we did find that

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.740 
sections of the cob we did find that
that<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.430> rain<00:06:12.700> that<00:06:12.940> we<00:06:13.090> had<00:06:13.300> during<00:06:13.600> the

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
that the rain that we had during the

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.190 
that the rain that we had during the
rainy<00:06:14.320> season<00:06:14.910> destroyed<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.090> cob<00:06:16.360> causing

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
rainy season destroyed the cob causing

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:26.040 
rainy season destroyed the cob causing
