00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.350 
hey guys next gen redstone here and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.710 
hey guys next gen redstone here and
today<00:00:04.350> I'd<00:00:04.650> like<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.920> show<00:00:05.490> off<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.730> new<00:00:06.029> and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
today I'd like to show off a new and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.810 
today I'd like to show off a new and
very<00:00:06.750> cool<00:00:07.560> invention<00:00:08.220> we've<00:00:08.370> come<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.670> with

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
very cool invention we've come up with

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.930 
very cool invention we've come up with
on<00:00:09.889> Tybee<00:00:10.889> riders<00:00:11.280> world<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.670> redstone

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
on Tybee riders world of redstone

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.550 
on Tybee riders world of redstone
version<00:00:12.630> 2<00:00:12.750> point<00:00:12.990> 0<00:00:13.139> test<00:00:14.070> server<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.560> this

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
version 2 point 0 test server and this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
version 2 point 0 test server and this
is<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.039> 7-segment<00:00:17.640> display<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.210> made<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
is just the 7-segment display we made to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.730 
is just the 7-segment display we made to
show<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.199> off<00:00:19.580> it's<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.939> binary<00:00:21.810> counter<00:00:22.320> but

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
show it off it's a binary counter but

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.320 
show it off it's a binary counter but
not<00:00:23.039> any<00:00:23.279> binary<00:00:23.550> counter<00:00:24.170> is<00:00:25.490> one<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
not any binary counter is one of the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
not any binary counter is one of the
most<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:28.019> not<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> most<00:00:28.500> efficient<00:00:29.340> binary

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
most if not the most efficient binary

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.600 
most if not the most efficient binary
counter<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.420> Minecraft<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:31.460> of<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:35.239> so

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
counter in all of Minecraft as of now so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
counter in all of Minecraft as of now so
what<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.450> simple

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
what you have here is you know simple

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.400 
what you have here is you know simple
clock<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.640> but<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.540> how<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> binary

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
clock right but this is how the binary

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.080 
clock right but this is how the binary
counter<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.190> works<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.579> turn<00:00:44.940> off<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
counter really works you turn off the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.940 
counter really works you turn off the
pot<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> show<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.280> how<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.579> works<00:00:47.719> so

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
pot for you to show you how it works so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.930 
pot for you to show you how it works so
we<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.960> think<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.320> 8-bit<00:00:52.860> Pistons<00:00:53.430> eight

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we have I think it's 8-bit Pistons eight

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
we have I think it's 8-bit Pistons eight
eight<00:00:54.210> Pistons<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.230> represent

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
eight Pistons right now which represent

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:07.539 
eight Pistons right now which represent
eight<00:00:55.920> eight<00:00:56.670> bits<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> does<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
eight eight bits and so what it does is

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.940 
eight eight bits and so what it does is
you<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> line<00:01:10.439> has<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.710> found

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you see here this line has to be found

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.210 
you see here this line has to be found
so<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:13.520> master<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:16.220> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so this is like a master off on you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.460 
so this is like a master off on you
can't<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.549> lever<00:01:20.750> seven<00:01:21.750> trouble<00:01:21.990> rendering

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
can't a lever seven trouble rendering

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
can't a lever seven trouble rendering
but<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:25.220> basically<00:01:26.220> ah<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but so what we have is basically ah a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
but so what we have is basically ah a
bud<00:01:28.500> switch<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.659> every<00:01:31.100> piston<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:32.939> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
bud switch on every piston see if it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.630 
bud switch on every piston see if it's
pushed<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.979> Pistons<00:01:34.979> pushed<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.369> its

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
pushed out the Pistons pushed out its

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.590 
pushed out the Pistons pushed out its
own<00:01:35.790> power<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.210> update<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
own power and then you can update it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.700 
own power and then you can update it
like<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.490> it'll<00:01:41.759> update<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.720> then

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
like so and see it'll update on and then

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
like so and see it'll update on and then
off<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:45.500> sponges<00:01:46.500> only<00:01:46.890> reset<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.670> update

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
off and sponges only reset or update

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.190 
off and sponges only reset or update
other<00:01:48.979> distance<00:01:50.060> when<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.360> retract<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
other distance when they retract and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.580 
other distance when they retract and
they<00:01:53.130> update<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.479> five<00:01:54.509> by<00:01:55.409> five

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
they update in a three by five by five

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.510 
they update in a three by five by five
grid<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.700> sponge<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.310> four

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
grid around the sponge so when this four

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.850 
grid around the sponge so when this four
tracks<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.030> interacts<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> piston<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
tracks it interacts with the piston to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.459 
tracks it interacts with the piston to
the<00:02:01.950> left<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.000> right<00:02:03.170> only<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the left and to the right only when it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.670 
the left and to the right only when it
retracts<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.310> I'll<00:02:06.240> show<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> pattern<00:02:07.500> of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
retracts so I'll show you the pattern of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160 
retracts so I'll show you the pattern of
this<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> watch<00:02:09.360> closely<00:02:09.629> you'll

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this and if you watch closely you'll

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.540 
this and if you watch closely you'll
notice<00:02:10.229> something<00:02:10.800> very<00:02:10.830> interesting<00:02:11.190> on

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
notice something very interesting on

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.770 
notice something very interesting on
have<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> first<00:02:12.120> three<00:02:12.330> bits<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:12.660> enabled

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
have the first three bits here enabled

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.119 
have the first three bits here enabled
see<00:02:14.780> now<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.049> one<00:02:15.170> has<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.379> go<00:02:15.469> up<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:15.980> order

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
see now this one has to go up in order

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.330 
see now this one has to go up in order
to<00:02:16.310> pull<00:02:16.549> this<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:16.790> back<00:02:16.969> but<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.159> one

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
to pull this one back but then this one

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.849 
to pull this one back but then this one
goes<00:02:19.489> up<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.359> one<00:02:20.510> goes<00:02:20.659> out<00:02:22.420> out<00:02:23.859> then

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
goes up so this one goes out out then

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.220 
goes up so this one goes out out then
all<00:02:25.129> them<00:02:25.340> go<00:02:25.519> out<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.939> then<00:02:26.540> they<00:02:26.659> come<00:02:26.810> reset

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
all them go out and then they come reset

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.140 
all them go out and then they come reset
to<00:02:27.439> zero<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.139> you<00:02:30.349> have<00:02:31.219> a<00:02:31.250> little<00:02:32.000> bit

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to zero and so if you have a little bit

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.589 
to zero and so if you have a little bit
of<00:02:32.239> binary<00:02:32.900> knowledge<00:02:34.150> you'll<00:02:35.150> notice<00:02:35.450> that

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
of binary knowledge you'll notice that

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.000 
of binary knowledge you'll notice that
this<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.790> actually<00:02:38.560> binary<00:02:39.560> counter<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:41.120> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
this is actually binary counter and so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.300 
this is actually binary counter and so
using<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:44.019> concept<00:02:45.019> would<00:02:45.439> set<00:02:45.739> today<00:02:45.950> real

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
using this concept would set today real

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.420 
using this concept would set today real
quick<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:46.639> I<00:02:46.669> can<00:02:46.730> show<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.030> better<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:51.430> using

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
quick so I can show you better so using

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.709 
quick so I can show you better so using
this<00:02:52.639> concept<00:02:52.909> of<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:57.519> piston<00:02:58.519> spawns<00:02:59.180> bud

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
this concept of the piston spawns bud

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:05.259 
this concept of the piston spawns bud
switches<00:03:00.519> we<00:03:01.519> have<00:03:01.760> created<00:03:02.689> this<00:03:04.269> freaking

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
switches we have created this freaking

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.509 
switches we have created this freaking
monster<00:03:05.569> here<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:09.549> 64<00:03:10.549> bits<00:03:10.879> of

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
monster here this is 64 bits of

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.780 
monster here this is 64 bits of
Minecraft<00:03:14.590> binary<00:03:16.930> amazing<00:03:18.549> stupidity<00:03:19.549> pneus

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
Minecraft binary amazing stupidity pneus

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:31.020 
Minecraft binary amazing stupidity pneus
and<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:24.639> we<00:03:25.639> kind<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.150> got<00:03:26.269> bored<00:03:26.680> with<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.739> um

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.659 

not<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:33.500> know<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.769> were<00:03:33.919> we<00:03:34.250> were<00:03:34.310> wondering

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
not you know we were we were wondering

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:35.740 
not you know we were we were wondering
how<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.790> was<00:03:34.939> going<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.239> take<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.449> get<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.599> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
how I was going to take to get to the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.879 
how I was going to take to get to the
end<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:37.310> did<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.459> little<00:03:37.669> math<00:03:37.909> and<00:03:41.889> it'll

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
end so we did a little math and it'll

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:43.350 
end so we did a little math and it'll
take

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
take

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.280 
take
take<00:03:43.480> 70<00:03:44.320> times<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.010> length<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.490> universe

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
take 70 times the length of the universe

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.480 
take 70 times the length of the universe
to<00:03:47.290> count<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:48.300> 64<00:03:49.300> bits<00:03:49.570> in<00:03:50.020> Minecraft<00:03:50.770> so<00:03:51.280> I'll

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
to count to 64 bits in Minecraft so I'll

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.330 
to count to 64 bits in Minecraft so I'll
demonstrate<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:53.200> honestly<00:03:53.350> why<00:03:53.830> it's<00:03:54.100> so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
demonstrate but honestly why it's so

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.180 
demonstrate but honestly why it's so
long<00:03:54.690> because<00:03:55.690> every<00:03:56.650> time<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.890> want<00:03:57.130> the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
long because every time you want the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.650 
long because every time you want the
next<00:03:57.400> one<00:03:57.550> update<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.940> have<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.150> update<00:03:58.330> all

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
next one update you have to update all

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:07.770 
next one update you have to update all
the<00:03:58.780> ones<00:03:58.930> before<00:03:59.110> first<00:04:00.840> see<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:04.560> time<00:04:06.780> pretty

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
the ones before first see so time pretty

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.890 
the ones before first see so time pretty
much<00:04:07.900> doubles<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.830> is<00:04:09.209> all<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.270> believe

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
much doubles and this is all I believe

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.560 
much doubles and this is all I believe
single-edged<00:04:11.680> instant<00:04:12.280> because<00:04:12.880> Pistons<00:04:13.450> are

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
single-edged instant because Pistons are

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.000 
single-edged instant because Pistons are
instant<00:04:13.990> retracting<00:04:14.560> if<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.220> watch<00:04:18.870> see

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
instant retracting if you watch see

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.280 
instant retracting if you watch see
instant<00:04:21.060> instantaneous<00:04:22.060> no<00:04:22.300> delay<00:04:22.570> at<00:04:22.690> all<00:04:25.290> so

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
instant instantaneous no delay at all so

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.020 
instant instantaneous no delay at all so
I<00:04:26.320> can<00:04:26.830> demonstrate<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.520> instantaneous

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
I can demonstrate the instantaneous

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.120 
I can demonstrate the instantaneous
effect<00:04:29.430> by<00:04:30.430> turning<00:04:31.180> off<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.390> clock<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.130> then

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
effect by turning off the clock and then

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.180 
effect by turning off the clock and then
hitting<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.490> reset<00:04:34.030> all<00:04:34.150> by<00:04:34.330> 20<00:04:35.190> stands

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
hitting this reset all by 20 stands

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.550 
hitting this reset all by 20 stands
watch<00:04:36.750> mmhmm<00:04:37.750> yeah<00:04:39.570> I'm<00:04:40.570> all<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.169> other<00:04:41.290> bites

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
watch mmhmm yeah I'm all the other bites

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.100 
watch mmhmm yeah I'm all the other bites
already<00:04:41.740> at<00:04:42.010> 0<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.460> didn't<00:04:42.700> really<00:04:42.730> do<00:04:42.940> much

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
already at 0 so it didn't really do much

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.290 
already at 0 so it didn't really do much
but<00:04:44.110> yeah<00:04:44.590> thanks<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:45.669> watching<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.270> don't
