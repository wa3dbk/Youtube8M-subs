maybe or 720 but to me it sounds like
it's<00:00:49.469> some<00:00:49.649> people<00:00:49.980> walking<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.030> some<00:00:51.270> kind

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it's some people walking up to some kind

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
it's some people walking up to some kind
of<00:00:51.690> door<00:00:51.930> some<00:00:52.170> metal<00:00:52.199> door<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.489> hear

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
of door some metal door and you can hear

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
of door some metal door and you can hear
the<00:00:53.699> keys<00:00:54.030> rattling<00:00:54.510> them<00:00:54.719> opening<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> door

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the keys rattling them opening the door

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590

and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:55.949> slamming<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> shut<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> used<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and then slamming it shut now I used to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.209 
and then slamming it shut now I used to
think<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:57.989> some<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.649> giant<00:00:58.920> just

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
think this was some kind of giant just

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
think this was some kind of giant just
because<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> loud<00:01:00.449> footsteps<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.289> I've

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
because of the loud footsteps but I've

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
because of the loud footsteps but I've
been<00:01:01.500> watching<00:01:01.949> some<00:01:02.430> videos<00:01:02.789> lately<00:01:03.120> about

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
been watching some videos lately about

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
been watching some videos lately about
this<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.170> why<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> decided<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:04.979> my

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this and that's why I decided to make my

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.469 
this and that's why I decided to make my
video<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> few

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
video on this because there's a few

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.780 
video on this because there's a few
points<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.080> want<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> point<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
points that I want to point out so I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370 
points that I want to point out so I
used<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.450> actually<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.930> giant

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
used to think this was actually a giant

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
used to think this was actually a giant
you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> could<00:01:10.860> hear<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> footsteps<00:01:11.369> at

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you know you could hear the footsteps at

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520 
you know you could hear the footsteps at
the<00:01:11.880> start<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> saw<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> few<00:01:13.439> more

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the start but then I saw a few more

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
the start but then I saw a few more
videos<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.310> led<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.150> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
videos and I led to the point that it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
videos and I led to the point that it's
you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.049> hear<00:01:16.110> someone<00:01:16.770> walking<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> some

present maybe maybe some prison door or
some<00:01:20.790> metal<00:01:21.060> door<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.659> hear<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960

some metal door then you can hear the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and then the Slammy closed now why would

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
and then the Slammy closed now why would
they<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.250> put<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> end<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> die

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
they actually put this in the end of die

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
they actually put this in the end of die
rise<00:01:27.600> could<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> maybe<00:01:28.229> give<00:01:28.530> us<00:01:28.650> some<00:01:28.829> hints

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
rise could it maybe give us some hints

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.280 
rise could it maybe give us some hints
to<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> next<00:01:30.000> map<00:01:30.180> maybe<00:01:30.479> could<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.079> give<00:01:31.200> us

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
to the next map maybe could it give us

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.749 
to the next map maybe could it give us
some<00:01:31.439> hints<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> Easter<00:01:32.400> Egg<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> know

some hints to the Easter Egg you know

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
some hints to the Easter Egg you know
what<00:01:32.970> could<00:01:33.119> happen<00:01:33.299> later<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.380> it's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
what could happen later on because it's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.109 
what could happen later on because it's
very<00:01:34.829> strange<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.790> why<00:01:35.939> they

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
very strange and I don't know why they

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
very strange and I don't know why they
would<00:01:36.240> put<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> end<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.229> die<00:01:37.439> rise

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
would put this in the end of die rise

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
would put this in the end of die rise
like<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> said<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:38.549> people<00:01:38.939> walking<00:01:39.479> up

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
like I said it's some people walking up

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.420 
like I said it's some people walking up
to<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> door<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.590> someone<00:01:40.860> walking<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to a door or someone walking up to the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.550 
to a door or someone walking up to the
door<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> prison<00:01:42.659> door<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.049> maybe<00:01:43.290> he's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
door like a prison door and maybe he's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830 
door like a prison door and maybe he's
like<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> setting<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.880> prisoner<00:01:45.450> free<00:01:45.689> or

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
like kind of setting a prisoner free or

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
like kind of setting a prisoner free or
something<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.340> he's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
something like that and then he's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
something like that and then he's
slamming<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> door<00:01:48.180> shut<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.630> guys<00:01:48.659> will

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
slamming the door shut you guys will

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
slamming the door shut you guys will
have<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> analyze<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.490> bit<00:01:50.729> further<00:01:51.030> it's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
have to analyze this a bit further it's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.810 
have to analyze this a bit further it's
really<00:01:51.600> hard<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.549> could

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
really hard to make out what this could

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.370 
really hard to make out what this could
actually<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.780> I've<00:01:54.930> said<00:01:55.140> what

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
actually be you know like I've said what

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
actually be you know like I've said what
I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> someone<00:01:56.369> walking<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
I think is a someone walking up to the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
I think is a someone walking up to the
door<00:01:56.939> open<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.750> closing<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> maybe

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
door open it and then closing it maybe

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.260 
door open it and then closing it maybe
it's<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.250> something<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.850> with<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> next

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's got something to do with the next

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
it's got something to do with the next
map<00:02:00.420> maybe<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> next<00:02:00.899> map<00:02:01.200> could<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
map maybe the next map could be in a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
map maybe the next map could be in a
prison<00:02:02.310> leave<00:02:02.640> let<00:02:02.909> someone<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
prison leave let someone out of the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
prison leave let someone out of the
prison<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> now<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> prisoners<00:02:05.219> got

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
prison and now that prisoners got

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.830 
prison and now that prisoners got
something<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> next<00:02:06.540> map<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
something to do with the next map you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
something to do with the next map you
know<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.170> could<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.409> giving<00:02:07.500> us<00:02:07.680> some<00:02:07.950> clues

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
know they could be giving us some clues

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.650 
know they could be giving us some clues
they<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.910> giving<00:02:09.000> us<00:02:09.179> clues<00:02:09.390> on

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
they could be giving us clues on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.630 
they could be giving us clues on
anything<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> said<00:02:11.009> guys<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> think

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
anything and like I said guys I think

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.800 
anything and like I said guys I think
it's<00:02:11.760> very<00:02:11.940> strange<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it's very strange I don't think that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.790 
it's very strange I don't think that
would<00:02:12.870> put<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.470> there

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
would put this in there

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.290 
would put this in there
no<00:02:13.920> reason<00:02:14.160> maybe<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.940> next<00:02:15.150> map

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
no reason maybe it's for the next map

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.660 
no reason maybe it's for the next map
maybe<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> could<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.840> telling<00:02:16.140> us<00:02:16.260> or<00:02:16.580> given<00:02:17.580> us

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
maybe it could be telling us or given us

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.070 
maybe it could be telling us or given us
some<00:02:17.850> idea<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.450> could<00:02:18.630> happen<00:02:18.780> at<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
some idea and what could happen at the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.020 
some idea and what could happen at the
ended<00:02:19.440> our<00:02:19.590> eyes<00:02:19.800> maybe<00:02:20.130> someone<00:02:20.550> setting<00:02:20.820> one

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
ended our eyes maybe someone setting one

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.700 
ended our eyes maybe someone setting one
of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> prisoners<00:02:21.450> free<00:02:21.900> or<00:02:22.080> some<00:02:22.320> kind<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
of the prisoners free or some kind of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.740 
of the prisoners free or some kind of
zombie<00:02:22.770> or<00:02:23.190> something<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.510> can

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
zombie or something that and you can

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.110 
zombie or something that and you can
also<00:02:24.960> hear<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> kind<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.190> crawler<00:02:26.520> zombies<00:02:26.970> as

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
also hear the kind of crawler zombies as

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.790 
also hear the kind of crawler zombies as
well<00:02:27.240> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.450> listen<00:02:27.750> very<00:02:27.780> closely<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.560> again

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
well if you listen very closely so again

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.020 
well if you listen very closely so again
maybe<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.040> got<00:02:29.250> something<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:29.910> that

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
maybe it's got something to do with that

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
maybe it's got something to do with that
it's<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.200> weird<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.770> always<00:02:31.920> say

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it's really weird like we always say

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
it's really weird like we always say
everything<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.850> zombies<00:02:33.240> means<00:02:33.510> something

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
everything in zombies means something

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.750 
everything in zombies means something
they're<00:02:34.170> always<00:02:34.320> mysterious<00:02:34.770> treyarch<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.550> but
