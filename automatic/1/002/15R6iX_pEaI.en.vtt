00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
another video um this time I'd like to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.789 
another video um this time I'd like to
show<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.089> two<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.569> my<00:00:06.720> experiments<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.500> did

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
show you two of my experiments I did

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.629 
show you two of my experiments I did
with<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:09.349> molecular<00:00:10.349> add-on<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.519> is

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
with the molecular add-on that is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.320 
with the molecular add-on that is
currently<00:00:13.040> talked<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> lot<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
currently talked about a lot in the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
currently talked about a lot in the
blender<00:00:15.630> community<00:00:15.859> it<00:00:16.859> actually<00:00:17.279> has<00:00:17.430> been

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
blender community it actually has been

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.670 
blender community it actually has been
around<00:00:17.640> since<00:00:18.240> quite<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> while<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.289> sure

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
around since quite a while I'm not sure

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.939 
around since quite a while I'm not sure
how<00:00:20.010> long<00:00:20.279> exactly<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.779> has<00:00:22.439> been<00:00:22.740> there

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
how long exactly but it has been there

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.480 
how long exactly but it has been there
since<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.310> few<00:00:23.490> months<00:00:23.550> however<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:25.010> just<00:00:26.010> tested

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
since a few months however I just tested

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.300 
since a few months however I just tested
it<00:00:26.550> again<00:00:26.910> today<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.949> had<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.160> pretty

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it again today and I had some pretty

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950 
it again today and I had some pretty
cool<00:00:29.670> results<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.359> thought<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> would<00:00:30.779> show

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
cool results so I thought I would show

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.290 
cool results so I thought I would show
you<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.870> as<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.260> first<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:35.489> which

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you now this here as the first one which

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.500 
you now this here as the first one which
is<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.920> know<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:38.250> exactly<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> looks

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
is I know what exactly this but it looks

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.160 
is I know what exactly this but it looks
pretty<00:00:39.960> cool<00:00:40.280> like<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.670> has<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.540> bit<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.350> fluid

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
pretty cool like it has a bit of a fluid

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.040 
pretty cool like it has a bit of a fluid
fluid<00:00:46.170> ish<00:00:46.440> behavior<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> same<00:00:48.750> time

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
fluid ish behavior and at the same time

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.189 
fluid ish behavior and at the same time
you<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:49.829> jelly<00:00:50.840> parties<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.960> fall

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
you see these jelly parties that fall

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.670 
you see these jelly parties that fall
down<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.820> end<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.260> pretty<00:00:55.410> cool

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
down at the end I think it's pretty cool

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.849 
down at the end I think it's pretty cool
the<00:00:56.399> only<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> shame

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the only thing that I think it's a shame

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.580 
the only thing that I think it's a shame
but<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.329> whole<00:01:00.510> thing<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.410> there

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
but the that whole thing is that there

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.369 
but the that whole thing is that there
is<00:01:01.710> no<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:02.129> good<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> render<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.120> if

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
is no really good way to render it if

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
is no really good way to render it if
any<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.799> knows<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.519> good<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
any of you knows a good way to do that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
any of you knows a good way to do that
please<00:01:07.350> let<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.799> I'd<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.549> love<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
please let me know I'd really love to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
please let me know I'd really love to
know<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.750> course<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> could

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
know of course I know that you could

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.090 
know of course I know that you could
just<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:11.909> kritis<00:01:12.390> fear<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.100> make

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
just you know kritis fear and make

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.719 
just you know kritis fear and make
instances<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.119> every<00:01:15.750> particle<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.580> not

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
instances and every particle but I'm not

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
instances and every particle but I'm not
really<00:01:17.880> happy<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.540> I'd<00:01:18.840> love<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really happy with that I'd love to have

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.109 
really happy with that I'd love to have
something<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.460> um<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.450> mesh<00:01:22.439> generation

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
something like um a mesh generation

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.840 
something like um a mesh generation
actually<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.619> real<00:01:25.920> quick<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
actually so just real quick this is the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
actually so just real quick this is the
second<00:01:27.299> one<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.630> tried<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.439> stick<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
second one I tried to make it stick to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
second one I tried to make it stick to
the<00:01:28.890> wall<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.299> wall<00:01:30.479> also<00:01:30.780> has

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the wall so actually the wall also has

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.330 
the wall so actually the wall also has
particles<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:33.140> which<00:01:34.189> more<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.280> less

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
particles on it and which more or less

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
particles on it and which more or less
make<00:01:35.850> these<00:01:36.509> particles<00:01:36.930> stick<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.380> which

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
make these particles stick to it which

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.910 
make these particles stick to it which
also<00:01:37.890> looks<00:01:38.130> pretty<00:01:38.250> cool<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.680> about<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
also looks pretty cool so about what I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.810 
also looks pretty cool so about what I
just<00:01:41.100> said<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.490> also<00:01:41.960> did<00:01:42.960> some<00:01:42.990> research<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
just said I also did some research and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.499 
just said I also did some research and
found<00:01:44.869> an<00:01:45.869> add-on<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.950> converts<00:01:47.729> particles

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
found an add-on that converts particles

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.810 
found an add-on that converts particles
into<00:01:48.780> meshes<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.070> also<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
into meshes but that's also just a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.170 
into meshes but that's also just a
solution<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.810> based<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.610> those<00:01:53.610> hard

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
solution that is based on those hard

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.649 
solution that is based on those hard
equals<00:01:54.450> meter<00:01:54.689> balls<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.659> wasn't

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
equals meter balls and it I wasn't

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
equals meter balls and it I wasn't
really<00:01:57.810> worried<00:01:58.140> satisfied<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> both

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
really worried satisfied with it in both

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.870 
really worried satisfied with it in both
performance<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.450> quality<00:02:01.399> yeah<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.729> if

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
performance and quality yeah so if

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.770 
performance and quality yeah so if
anyone<00:02:03.299> could<00:02:03.509> tell<00:02:04.079> me<00:02:04.290> how<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.969> solved<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
anyone could tell me how you solved that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.740 
anyone could tell me how you solved that
or<00:02:07.079> how

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
or how

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.770 
or how
our<00:02:07.870> family<00:02:08.830> argues<00:02:09.369> about<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:10.060> I'd<00:02:10.270> love<00:02:10.660> to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
our family argues about that I'd love to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.570 
our family argues about that I'd love to
hear<00:02:10.929> them<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.990> there<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.580> that's

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
hear them and then that there is that's
