00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:14.670
 of many bicycles is difficult for me 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.670
 I look like a little serious 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.810
 for positive good feelings but 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.550
 they go a little with uncertainty of knowing 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.619
 that in the corrido during the last month 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.079
 if you do not look it's always the favorite number 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 one because it showed that normal is 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.619
 Awesome 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.000
 in that race even mantecón and with 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.800
 much better position than me and then 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.760
 I return lover with him is a worker 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.040
 born 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.719
 lejarreta is a talent and has won 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 world championships in categories 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.680
 inferiors and then well we also have 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.760
 a carlos coloma that is a bomb 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.230
 uncertain 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 In a way, it looks a lot like me 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.679
 is what you can do everything you can do what 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.929
 same let's share an experience 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.600
 Olympic this year and I think the three 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.059
 of them very well very good game in 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.140
 roll and with doing something that high but there 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.719
 have to bear in mind that we have 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.219
 mantecón a carlos coloma los tres buenos 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.310
 the two Olympians who will accompany me 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.020
 ease not innate ease through 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.490
 of a small mountain bike like 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.470
 this much what it takes many 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.730
 resources because they take it innate and 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.140
 doubts on paper 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.400
 favorites are also jose antonio 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.370
 hermetic and pantheon but you do not have to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.820
 forget about driving the goalkeeper 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.820
 high level 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.000
 among the top five in the area of 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.890
 the forward lowering thus has left the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.320
 technician can not be confused in any 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.880
 moment with the circuit that is very 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 technical the heat that will tighten 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 very much today we talk about a very burden 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.150
 the circuit that has a lot of erosion lasts 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.640
 and carod and there have been many races 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.190
 a lot of training then they have 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.310
 actually made areas of exactly the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.659
 first round 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.159
 and pretty fast where 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.759
 well you can not make many mistakes 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.200
 in my opinion it lacks a bit of 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.299
 racing to the races and you have to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.710
 add then at the end when you're 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.600
 got into a career, you do not even realize 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.670
 if you're helping from the piles of 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 a risky sport and if between 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.940
 impossible but a medal then there is 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 to risk as we always go to 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.260
 try to do what you can 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.239
 we'll see each other soon
