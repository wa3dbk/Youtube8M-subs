00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
not so much as an aerobatic multi right

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.040 
not so much as an aerobatic multi right
of<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.160> more<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.790> cinematic<00:02:43.269> platformer<00:02:43.810> so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you know you put in gps attitude hold

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.820 
you know you put in gps attitude hold
and<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.049> sort<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.200> sits<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:47.590> doesn't

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830

and it just sort of sits there doesn't
it<00:02:47.890> yes<00:02:48.549> but<00:02:49.239> um<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:50.110> far<00:02:50.290> as<00:02:50.440> flying<00:02:50.650> guys<00:02:50.890> look

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
it yes but um as far as flying guys look

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.740 
it yes but um as far as flying guys look
it's<00:02:51.160> better<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.549> attitude<00:02:51.970> mode<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.390> seems<00:02:52.630> to

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it's better in attitude mode it seems to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.320 
it's better in attitude mode it seems to
be<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.870> lot<00:02:53.049> more<00:02:53.110> flowing<00:02:53.650> doesn't<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.160> um<00:02:54.820> yes

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330
