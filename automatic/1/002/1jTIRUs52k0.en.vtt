00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
core and basically all I got a deal on

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.260 
core and basically all I got a deal on
my<00:01:46.000> heater<00:01:46.329> core<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:47.549> pull<00:01:48.549> down<00:01:48.579> on<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.030> and

my heater core is pull down on it and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.600 
my heater core is pull down on it and
then<00:01:49.390> pull<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.750> out<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.229> comes<00:01:50.380> out<00:01:50.619> simple

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
then pull it out and it comes out simple

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
then pull it out and it comes out simple
as<00:01:51.700> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
as that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.480 
as that
so<00:01:53.560> we'll<00:01:54.280> see<00:01:54.460> what<00:01:54.549> we<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.820> do

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
so we'll see what we can do

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.919 
so we'll see what we can do
well<00:01:57.490> I'd<00:01:57.789> say<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.179> heater<00:01:58.450> core<00:01:58.750> was

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
well I'd say this heater core was

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.370 
well I'd say this heater core was
definitely<00:01:59.530> no<00:01:59.649> good<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:01.049> usually<00:02:02.049> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
definitely no good because usually the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.700 
definitely no good because usually the
hose<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.890> supposed<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.340> come<00:02:03.579> out<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
hose is supposed to come out not the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.240 
hose is supposed to come out not the
hole<00:02:07.440> that's<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.619> whole<00:02:08.739> pipe<00:02:09.009> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
hole that's the whole pipe and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.460 
hole that's the whole pipe and
everything<00:02:10.680> so<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.709> got<00:02:11.890> one<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:13.470> honestly

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
everything so I got one out I honestly

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.940 
everything so I got one out I honestly
don't<00:02:14.680> think<00:02:14.950> these<00:02:15.099> hoses<00:02:15.519> have<00:02:16.620> ever<00:02:17.620> been

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
don't think these hoses have ever been

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.600 
don't think these hoses have ever been
removed<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:20.080> probably<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> factory<00:02:21.069> heater

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
removed it's probably the factory heater

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.460 
removed it's probably the factory heater
core<00:02:21.940> oh<00:02:23.129> well

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
core oh well

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.539 
core oh well
trying<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.560> my<00:02:26.650> best<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.099> stay<00:02:27.310> out<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
trying to my best to stay out of the

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.949 
trying to my best to stay out of the
wind<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:27.940> but<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.209> thought<00:02:28.480> hell<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:28.870> it

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
wind here but I thought hell if it

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.360 
wind here but I thought hell if it
happened<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.380> one<00:02:29.530> side<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.950> might<00:02:30.099> as<00:02:30.220> well

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
happened to one side it might as well

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.809 
happened to one side it might as well
happen<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.880> other<00:02:31.090> side<00:02:31.680> little<00:02:32.819> redneck

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
happen to the other side little redneck

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.960 
happen to the other side little redneck
tip<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.299> mine<00:02:35.340> probably<00:02:36.340> not<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.610> best<00:02:36.819> thing

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
tip of mine probably not the best thing

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.690 
tip of mine probably not the best thing
to<00:02:37.030> do<00:02:37.239> but<00:02:37.739> what<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.799> do<00:02:38.860> when<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.160> have<00:02:39.190> hoses

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700

a<00:02:58.700> little<00:02:58.879> bit<00:02:59.799> with<00:03:00.799> wd-40<00:03:01.629> so<00:03:02.629> I<00:03:02.659> did<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
