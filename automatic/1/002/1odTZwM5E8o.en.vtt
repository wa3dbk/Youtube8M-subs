if they heavy you you just chain it's

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.849 
if they heavy you you just chain it's
really<00:03:39.000> not<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.359> bad<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.560> cars<00:03:40.769> really

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859

protects your trap set plays I think the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.719 
protects your trap set plays I think the
story<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.680> must<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.250> three<00:03:50.549> heavy

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
story is a must with three heavy

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.949 
story is a must with three heavy
especially<00:03:51.629> if<00:03:51.959> you're<00:03:52.049> playing<00:03:52.169> traps<00:03:53.959> this
