00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.840
 - Hey, Bouchard! How are you? - Very good! 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 - Where are you going? - Please take me back to the hotel. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 Why did you start playing tennis? 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.520
 That was 15 years ago, I was only 5 years old. 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.960
 Mom asked me to go to the tennis class. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.400
 About once a week, but most of the time playing games. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 All the children have a good time, only I am not satisfied: 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.320
 "No, I want to play more tennis." My parents found out that I really wanted to play tennis. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.720
 I participated in the first competition at the age of 8! 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.480
 What do you think of the future of tennis? 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.880
 The stadium will have accurate electronic equipment. When the ball goes out of bounds, 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 Can make 100% correct judgment. 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 What about the future of tennis clothing? 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.720
 Magical clothing, when you sweat, it will lick 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.120
 - Sweat and stay dry. - Yes! 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.400
 - I am very sweaty. - me too! 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.400
 My song is like a cat being stretched around my neck. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.480
 Then fell into the river, the sound of drowning. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.960
 We took a friend, he is DJ, his mission is to record 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 The original music of "Road to the Road of Roland Garros". 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 - My name is Adrian. - My name is Eugene. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.760
 I heard that singing is not your specialty. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.720
 My song is terrible! I just told him. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760
 - You want me to do anything, I am ready. - whatever? 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000
 This is not recorded at all. You are really bad! 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.800
 Can you add some effects? 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 Sounds like a car accident! 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.840
 The worse you get worse! It turned out not so ugly! 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.800
 This is just to let you know how good your voice is, no need to add effects! 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.960
 Before the end of each interview, we will 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.880
 - Take a selfie together. - I am a "self-timer queen"! 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 You go back a little!
