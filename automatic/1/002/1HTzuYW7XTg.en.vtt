00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.289
 Hello my love 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 I was back last night 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.949
 fast at dm and there I have a few 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.689
 I found you in the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 then run all the next week 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.149
 but a few things from p 2 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 I then rediscovered them and the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.750
 I've never seen it there 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.489
 always so nice sign on it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 that the colors of the nail polish are new 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 are and as a first tone I have me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.410
 bought this beautiful red that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.010
 the color 650 fifa is a beautiful 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.829
 red with light float inside it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.600
 and he really looks really great 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.000
 Nice and the order is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
 Bombastic easily the Dect in two 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 layers and do it in a few minutes 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.869
 so really dry 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.270
 Recommended for 195 a beautiful 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.010
 sound that fits in the autumn or 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 even if you are already a few weeks 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 wants to think further in the upcoming 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.270
 winter christmas season there I find the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.040
 especially for christmas miracles 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 so have a nice look 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.659
 I really wanted to see you guys today 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.689
 show from the same series namely 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.259
 the p2 color victim series a beautiful 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.979
 green tone that is the number 624 final 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.990
 countdown 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.090
 and here is ultra on the back 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 Fast drying high gloss intensive 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 opacity and flat brush and all that 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.270
 I can really confirm 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.610
 I also like that green tone that fits 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.829
 now in the fall of it too 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.869
 a bit metallic and the order 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.049
 is easy you will like 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.729
 then I have another club alarm and 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.430
 Although exactly from this same series 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.950
 I still have the 693 sets 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.850
 taken and you see her already 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.549
 iuf this is the number of adecco 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.530
 144 costs about seven euros so 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.599
 if you do not spend the seven euros 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.440
 I want and I have two now 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.050
 same sounds but it does not matter 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.010
 twice better holds a beautiful 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.080
 dark purple shade with beautiful 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.700
 shimmer in there no gross glitter 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.730
 Particles and that's what I love too 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.860
 adecco nail polishes that the particles there 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.660
 such things are not that rude 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.180
 I do not really like it at all 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.890
 the more after carnival look and yes 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.390
 then you better take the last one for 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.210
 195 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.130
 then I wanted to show you 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.490
 but I also own and am in the wood 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.410
 I also test just on p2's 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.350
 a new lipstick that calls itself 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.440
 maxi lipstick looks a bit like 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.880
 So these basics of the presentation 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.260
 he looks a bit like that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.270
 statistics i have here now 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.210
 taken a beautiful I almost would 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.560
 say fuchsia tone number 0 50 youtube 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.360
 and I'm just trying on it 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.120
 have applied today is here 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.620
 this is a highly talented long 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.780
 Stick the lipstick with tender 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.250
 melting texture and shiny 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.840
 finish I write you here yet 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.220
 somewhere I hide you an award to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.170
 but I mean he has about three 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.330
 euro and I am very 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.610
 Excited what the order goes to the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.430
 does not smell so pleasant 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.530
 So I had a relatively neutral turn 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.660
 Doing odor I find a lot around 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.700
 very nice order now I am still 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.160
 curious if he still holds a bit 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.400
 or half way stops then I would be with it 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.739
 Satisfied but I wanted you up today 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.410
 show these nail polishes every time 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.570
 because I think the incredibly beautiful and 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.300
 I like that in this metallic look 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.190
 yes, especially there is just not always there 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.500
 so many shades that I like and 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.640
 the essence of that is not mine 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.430
 they always look a bit 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.120
 Carnival out but with these new tones 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.220
 from p 2 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.070
 I have to say, look at them 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.120
 Okay, that's ok 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.670
 getting used to the red suits 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.260
 perfect in the festive 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 season now, then it is already 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.010
 soon in eight weeks, yes in ten weeks 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.690
 it almost has to be christmas again 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.310
 and this dark 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.290
 the long do so can be 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.989
 Apply very well and if you 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.000
 looking for something like that and that 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.680
 red tun is really dark red 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.900
 cheesy so I hope that comes now 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.040
 synonymous in the video over as it is 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.290
 I wanted to intervene today 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.270
 push and now I would be happy 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.250
 if you know me comments because last 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.620
 you already have these shades 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.960
 already at your dm what do you think about it 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.730
 and which is your favorite shade 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.980
 From these three I will tell you now 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.580
 have shown here you can see again 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.200
 this p2 intense maxi lipstick there 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.790
 They also had different colors though 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.080
 we do everything in the course of the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.420
 next week I find that very much 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.820
 interesting in front of everything but you can 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.460
 you apply that very very precisely with 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.980
 this sharp tip of it off 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.560
 I like from the other hire the 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.139
 there was of this statistic of 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.430
 were those of adecco who have yes 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.110
 I'm not so good 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.830
 leaked I'm curious what the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.260
 here can 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.540
 Now I'm curious about your feedback 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.030
 and wish you a nice sunday 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.480
 and I hope to see you soon there 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:38.230
 my love is good 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:38.230
