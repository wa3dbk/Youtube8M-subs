00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
chorus we are going about it by using

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.819 
chorus we are going about it by using
pitch<00:00:50.219> shift<00:00:50.579> technology<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.770> at

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pitch shift technology so right here at

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
pitch shift technology so right here at
the<00:00:52.920> beginning<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> d2<00:00:54.059> knob<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.989> have

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the beginning at the d2 knob you have

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.799 
the beginning at the d2 knob you have
the<00:00:55.199> ability<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> either<00:00:55.949> flatten<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:57.210> or

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the ability to either flatten or or

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
the ability to either flatten or or
sharp<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:59.070> secondary<00:00:59.789> voice<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:05.369> more

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
sharp your secondary voice so the more

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.370 
sharp your secondary voice so the more
you<00:01:05.760> turn<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> control<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:06.840> sharp<00:01:07.200> or

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you turn the control the more sharp or

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.020 
you turn the control the more sharp or
flat<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.860> other<00:01:07.979> voice<00:01:08.250> gets<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.880> gives

flat the other voice gets and it gives

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:20.170 
flat the other voice gets and it gives
you<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> natural<00:01:09.420> coursing<00:01:10.200> sound

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
in order to control the the chorus sound

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.550 
in order to control the the chorus sound
and<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.000> mix<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.510> we<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.870> mix<00:01:24.170> control

and the mix of it we have a mix control
which<00:01:24.740> goes<00:01:24.950> from<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.250> hundred<00:01:25.580> percent<00:01:25.690> dry<00:01:27.190> to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
we also have a tone control that affects

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.529 
we also have a tone control that affects
the<00:01:35.289> affected<00:01:36.289> sound<00:01:36.560> only<00:01:37.149> there's<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.240> little

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
the affected sound only there's a little

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.950 
the affected sound only there's a little
mark<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:38.960> shows<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> flat<00:01:39.799> setting<00:01:40.250> and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
mark that shows you the flat setting and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.090 
mark that shows you the flat setting and
reducing<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.079> from<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.350> setting<00:01:42.649> we'll<00:01:42.890> take

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
reducing it from that setting we'll take

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.800 
reducing it from that setting we'll take
some<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.549> high<00:01:43.700> end<00:01:43.729> out<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.329> sound<00:01:44.600> to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
some of the high end out of the sound to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.789 
some of the high end out of the sound to
give<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.110> warmer<00:01:45.619> chorus<00:01:47.679> reminiscent<00:01:48.679> of

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
give you a warmer chorus reminiscent of

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.700 
give you a warmer chorus reminiscent of
some<00:01:49.039> 70's<00:01:49.579> style<00:01:49.729> choruses<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:53.619> raising<00:01:54.619> it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
some 70's style choruses and raising it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.620 
some 70's style choruses and raising it
up<00:01:54.860> will<00:01:55.039> give<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.340> sharper<00:01:55.969> chorus<00:01:56.329> sound

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
up will give you a sharper chorus sound

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.510 
up will give you a sharper chorus sound
a<00:01:56.780> little<00:01:56.990> bit<00:01:57.110> more<00:01:57.289> bright<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:57.890> your<00:01:58.009> present

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
a little bit more bright in your present

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.580 
a little bit more bright in your present
and<00:01:58.640> your<00:01:58.729> face<00:01:59.119> present<00:01:59.869> tight<00:02:00.079> kind<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and your face present tight kind of a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.089 
and your face present tight kind of a
sound<00:02:04.899> we<00:02:05.899> also<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.289> level<00:02:06.500> control<00:02:06.920> on

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
sound we also have a level control on

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.359 
sound we also have a level control on
there<00:02:07.310> which<00:02:07.549> allows<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.979> set<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.099> pedal

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
there which allows you to set the pedal

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.490 
there which allows you to set the pedal
for<00:02:10.549> unity<00:02:10.910> gain<00:02:11.150> or<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.930> could<00:02:12.079> set<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.410> up

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
for unity gain or you could set it up

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.370 
for unity gain or you could set it up
for<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.860> boost<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:13.970> if<00:02:14.510> you're<00:02:14.660> taking<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.110> little

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
for a boost so if you're taking a little

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.860 
for a boost so if you're taking a little
lick<00:02:16.190> or<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> solo<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.209> want<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.480> pump<00:02:17.690> up

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
lick or a solo that you want to pump up

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.589 
lick or a solo that you want to pump up
a<00:02:17.959> little<00:02:18.200> bit<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.590> could<00:02:19.030> raise<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.060> level

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
a little bit you could raise the level

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:29.289 
a little bit you could raise the level
of<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:26.170> we've<00:02:27.170> also<00:02:27.560> -<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.310> pitch<00:02:28.970> shift

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
of it we've also - that pitch shift

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.059 
of it we've also - that pitch shift
we've<00:02:29.720> also<00:02:30.019> added<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.400> more<00:02:32.030> recognizable

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
we've also added the more recognizable

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.559 
we've also added the more recognizable
controls<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.310> speed<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.790> depth<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.209> adds

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
controls of speed and depth that adds

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.550 
controls of speed and depth that adds
another<00:02:36.440> modulation<00:02:37.069> on<00:02:37.489> top<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.299> pitch

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
another modulation on top of the pitch

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.280 
another modulation on top of the pitch
shifted<00:02:39.560> voice<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:41.269> if<00:02:41.359> you<00:02:41.450> set<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.750> detune

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
shifted voice so if you set that detune

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.470 
shifted voice so if you set that detune
knob<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.799> 12<00:02:43.069> o'clock<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.730> takes<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.269> pitch

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
knob to 12 o'clock it takes the pitch
