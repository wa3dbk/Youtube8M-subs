00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
stick his stick his arms out there to
back<00:01:59.759> Wilder<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> straight<00:02:00.600> line<00:02:00.630> that's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
back Wilder up in a straight line that's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
back Wilder up in a straight line that's
something<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:01.530> doesn't<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.189> if

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
something that he doesn't want to do if

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.130 
something that he doesn't want to do if
it<00:02:02.729> starts<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> stuff<00:02:03.329> into<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> ring<00:02:03.780> against

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it starts to stuff into the ring against

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.789 
it starts to stuff into the ring against
some<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> top<00:02:05.219> 10<00:02:05.640> fighters<00:02:06.060> again<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
some of the top 10 fighters again I

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.800 
some of the top 10 fighters again I
think<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.039> Wilder<00:02:08.520> he<00:02:09.060> came<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.420> relatively

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
think for Wilder he came in relatively

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
think for Wilder he came in relatively
little<00:02:10.140> heavy<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> scales<00:02:10.860> I'd<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
little heavy on the scales I'd like to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.510 
little heavy on the scales I'd like to
see<00:02:11.489> him<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.790> back<00:02:11.970> down

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
see him get back down

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.810 
see him get back down
be<00:02:12.610> roughly<00:02:13.060> another<00:02:13.240> five<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.170> ten<00:02:14.350> pounds

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
be roughly another five to ten pounds

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.450 
be roughly another five to ten pounds
roughly<00:02:15.820> around<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.300> two<00:02:16.590> 22:18<00:02:17.590> mark<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> think

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
roughly around a two 22:18 mark I think

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.310 
roughly around a two 22:18 mark I think
that's<00:02:19.000> where<00:02:19.300> he's<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:20.020> his<00:02:20.230> best<00:02:20.620> body<00:02:21.040> wise

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
that's where he's at his best body wise

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's where he's at his best body wise
as<00:02:23.320> opposed<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.770> Molina<00:02:24.630> Molina<00:02:25.630> was<00:02:26.050> was

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
as opposed to Molina Molina was was

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.780 
as opposed to Molina Molina was was
brought<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.830> make<00:02:26.980> Walter<00:02:27.280> look<00:02:27.430> good<00:02:27.610> he

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
brought in to make Walter look good he

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
brought in to make Walter look good he
did<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> good<00:02:28.210> job<00:02:28.270> making<00:02:28.540> himself<00:02:28.870> look<00:02:29.230> like

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
did a good job making himself look like

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.630 
did a good job making himself look like
a<00:02:29.470> decent<00:02:29.740> competitor<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.540> end<00:02:32.640> everybody

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
a decent competitor in the end everybody

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.730 
a decent competitor in the end everybody
was<00:02:33.820> looking<00:02:34.150> towards<00:02:34.720> him<00:02:35.080> getting<00:02:35.560> knocked

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
was looking towards him getting knocked

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.920 
was looking towards him getting knocked
out<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.730> didn't<00:02:36.970> come<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.390> quickly<00:02:37.660> as

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
out and they didn't come as quickly as

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.920 
out and they didn't come as quickly as
well<00:02:38.170> expected<00:02:38.800> but<00:02:39.790> eventually<00:02:40.150> Walter<00:02:40.660> did

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
well expected but eventually Walter did

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.390 
well expected but eventually Walter did
land<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.560> knockout<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.840> right<00:02:43.840> now<00:02:44.070> or<00:02:45.070> wilder

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
land a knockout and right now or wilder

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.310 
land a knockout and right now or wilder
I<00:02:45.460> think<00:02:45.760> he<00:02:45.910> still<00:02:46.360> has<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> lot<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.990> he<00:02:47.110> needs

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
I think he still has a lot that he needs

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.990 
I think he still has a lot that he needs
to<00:02:47.500> improve<00:02:47.770> on<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.070> think<00:02:48.250> he<00:02:48.490> needs<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.790> work

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
to improve on I think he needs to work

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.540 
to improve on I think he needs to work
on<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.330> high<00:02:49.450> guard<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.530> also<00:02:50.980> think<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.430> he

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
on the high guard I also think that he

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.380 
on the high guard I also think that he
as<00:02:52.150> well<00:02:52.630> needs<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.230> work<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.010> circling<00:02:54.910> out<00:02:55.060> of

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
as well needs to work on circling out of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.330 
as well needs to work on circling out of
guys<00:02:55.780> punches<00:02:56.320> not<00:02:56.650> moving<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.280> straight

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
guys punches not moving in a straight

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.670 
guys punches not moving in a straight
line<00:02:57.550> that's<00:02:58.120> how<00:02:58.210> he's<00:02:58.360> gonna<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:58.660> caught<00:02:58.930> if

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
line that's how he's gonna get caught if

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.650 
line that's how he's gonna get caught if
he<00:02:59.770> fights<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.580> guy<00:03:00.730> who<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:01.030> relatively<00:03:01.450> his

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
he fights a guy who is relatively his

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.250 
he fights a guy who is relatively his
size

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260
