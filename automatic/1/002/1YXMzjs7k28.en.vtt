00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.970
 there and for 3 mm plywood boards 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.100
 decided on the basis of the fact 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.800
 that such a longboard is not straight 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.570
 but so-called convex congress has 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.560
 So it's bent in two directions 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.089
 and vax and concave is bent and that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880
 is the challenge with such a 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:26.859
 longboard to make that and in 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.859
 the appropriate form to press 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 on 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.650
 and now we have the variant 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.210
 decided 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.520
 in that we also have several longboards 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.610
 We have built a base plate too 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.710
 get threaded rods and nuts with you 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.140
 Washers for pressing 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.600
 multiplex 37er multiplex what a very 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.790
 Sturdy, sturdy material is plates 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.530
 from which we then stencil press 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.340
 we have built the board with 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 have pressed
