and but so that's the iPad 2 and this
little<00:01:09.520> beauty<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.889> iPad<00:01:12.609> air<00:01:12.789> now<00:01:13.539> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
little beauty is the iPad air now the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.419 
little beauty is the iPad air now the
first<00:01:13.869> thing<00:01:14.049> I<00:01:14.170> notice<00:01:14.649> when<00:01:14.679> I<00:01:14.859> pick<00:01:15.159> this<00:01:15.280> up

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
first thing I notice when I pick this up

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.429 
first thing I notice when I pick this up
in<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:15.609> Apple<00:01:15.939> shop<00:01:16.119> was<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.569> weight<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.289> it

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
in the Apple shop was the weight of it

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.120 
in the Apple shop was the weight of it
the<00:01:17.709> weight<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:18.729> different<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:20.499> don't

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
the weight is so different and I don't

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.449 
the weight is so different and I don't
think<00:01:21.399> this<00:01:21.670> is<00:01:21.819> particularly<00:01:22.209> heavy<00:01:23.459> but

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:24.459 
think this is particularly heavy but

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.609 
think this is particularly heavy but
it's<00:01:24.579> not<00:01:24.789> really<00:01:25.119> easy<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.749> use<00:01:26.380> with<00:01:26.590> one

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
it's not really easy to use with one

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.160 
it's not really easy to use with one
hand<00:01:26.859> you<00:01:27.399> can't<00:01:27.639> do<00:01:27.819> that<00:01:27.999> but<00:01:28.179> with<00:01:28.389> the<00:01:28.659> iPad

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
hand you can't do that but with the iPad

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.949 
hand you can't do that but with the iPad
air<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.759> can<00:01:30.939> actually<00:01:31.209> hold<00:01:31.329> it<00:01:31.509> very<00:01:31.630> easy

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
air you can actually hold it very easy

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.389 
air you can actually hold it very easy
with<00:01:32.259> one<00:01:32.770> hand<00:01:33.039> it's<00:01:33.759> not<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:33.999> problem<00:01:34.209> at<00:01:34.450> all

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
with one hand it's not a problem at all

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.359 
with one hand it's not a problem at all
so<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.509> lightness<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.349> a<00:01:38.380> thing<00:01:38.679> that<00:01:38.709> amazes

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
so the lightness is a thing that amazes

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.120 
so the lightness is a thing that amazes
me<00:01:39.609> with<00:01:39.939> this<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.240> absolutely<00:01:41.049> it's<00:01:41.859> just

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
me with this is absolutely it's just

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.779 
me with this is absolutely it's just
astonishing

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
astonishing

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.669 
astonishing
but<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:44.049> doesn't<00:01:44.439> feel<00:01:44.679> as<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:46.299> it's<00:01:46.679> plasticky

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
but it doesn't feel as if it's plasticky

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:48.749 
but it doesn't feel as if it's plasticky
or<00:01:47.740> anything<00:01:47.919> like<00:01:48.099> so<00:01:48.369> see<00:01:48.429> it's<00:01:48.639> an

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
or anything like so see it's an

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.690 
or anything like so see it's an
aluminium<00:01:48.999> not<00:01:49.840> aluminium<00:01:50.319> aluminium<00:01:50.700> back

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
aluminium not aluminium aluminium back

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.449 
aluminium not aluminium aluminium back
and<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:52.479> got<00:01:52.599> a<00:01:52.630> very<00:01:52.689> sturdy<00:01:53.079> feel<00:01:53.349> until<00:01:54.310> ox

feel<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.779> and<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.289> fact<00:02:02.439> that<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:03.099> the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
feel of it and the fact that it's the

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.059 
feel of it and the fact that it's the
same<00:02:03.369> size<00:02:03.639> screen<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.200> if<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.679> place<00:02:05.919> this

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
same size screen and if I place this

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.020 
same size screen and if I place this
against<00:02:06.369> my<00:02:06.869> iPad<00:02:07.869> -<00:02:08.550> you'll<00:02:09.550> see<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> actual

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
against my iPad - you'll see the actual

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.760 
against my iPad - you'll see the actual
reduction<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.790> size<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:13.120> not<00:02:13.450> massive

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
reduction in size is not massive

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.460 
reduction in size is not massive
but<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.010> feels<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:16.570> hundred<00:02:16.810> times<00:02:17.200> better

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
but it feels just a hundred times better

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.610 
but it feels just a hundred times better
than<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.580> iPad<00:02:18.940> 2<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:20.230> was<00:02:20.320> my<00:02:20.440> first

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
than the iPad 2 so that was my first

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.670 
than the iPad 2 so that was my first
impressions<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> iPad<00:02:22.180> 2

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
impressions and I do like the iPad 2

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.740 
impressions and I do like the iPad 2
iPad<00:02:23.680> 2<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.220> very<00:02:24.580> good<00:02:24.760> machine<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
iPad 2 is a very good machine but the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.200 
iPad 2 is a very good machine but the
upgrade<00:02:26.170> for<00:02:26.710> me<00:02:26.890> particularly<00:02:27.490> going<00:02:27.910> from<00:02:28.120> a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
upgrade for me particularly going from a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.380 
upgrade for me particularly going from a
2<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.420> an<00:02:28.690> air<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.440> amazing<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
2 to an air is just amazing and the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.160 
2 to an air is just amazing and the
screen<00:02:31.810> itself<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:33.660> brilliant<00:02:34.660> I've<00:02:34.960> got<00:02:35.080> an

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
screen itself is brilliant I've got an

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.440 
screen itself is brilliant I've got an
iPhone<00:02:35.440> 5<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.250> know<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.550> Retina<00:02:36.850> screen<00:02:36.880> and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
iPhone 5 so I know the Retina screen and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.850 
iPhone 5 so I know the Retina screen and
but<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.320> see<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.770> an<00:02:39.130> iPad<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.790> just

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
but to see it on an iPad is just

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.610 
but to see it on an iPad is just
honestly<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.840> amazingly<00:02:43.840> different<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
honestly it's amazingly different and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.240 
honestly it's amazingly different and
and<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:46.960> really<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.620> nice<00:02:47.920> it's<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and it's just really really nice it's a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.970 
and it's just really really nice it's a
real<00:02:48.570> nice<00:02:49.570> screen<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.320> it's<00:02:50.410> very<00:02:50.620> good<00:02:50.770> to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
real nice screen and it's very good to

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.490 
real nice screen and it's very good to
watch<00:02:51.360> movies<00:02:52.360> YouTube<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.110> there<00:02:53.320> looks

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
watch movies YouTube on there looks

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.770 
watch movies YouTube on there looks
particularly<00:02:54.130> better<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:55.540> when<00:02:55.690> you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
particularly better because when you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.810 
particularly better because when you
press<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.080> HD<00:02:56.440> button<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:56.830> actually<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.280> HD

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
press the HD button it actually is HD

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.180 
press the HD button it actually is HD
rather<00:02:58.690> than<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:59.050> fuzzy<00:02:59.320> HD<00:02:59.680> as<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.070> with

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
rather than a fuzzy HD as it was with

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.600 
rather than a fuzzy HD as it was with
the<00:03:00.220> iPad<00:03:00.610> 2<00:03:00.820> for<00:03:01.060> me<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:02.050> one<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.580> first

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
the iPad 2 for me and the one the first

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.060 
the iPad 2 for me and the one the first
thing<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.210> noticed<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.050> when<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.620> actually

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
thing I noticed and when I actually

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.890 
thing I noticed and when I actually
picked<00:03:06.460> this<00:03:06.580> up<00:03:06.760> was<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:09.520> screen<00:03:09.880> it's<00:03:10.630> very

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
picked this up was the screen it's very

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.450 
picked this up was the screen it's very
loud<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.230> me<00:03:11.320> just<00:03:11.500> unlock<00:03:12.150> my<00:03:13.150> iPad<00:03:15.060> um<00:03:17.460> when

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
loud it me just unlock my iPad um when

loud it me just unlock my iPad um when
you'll<00:03:18.610> type<00:03:18.850> in<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.620> lot<00:03:21.430> louder<00:03:21.580> than

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.810 

the<00:03:26.230> iPad<00:03:26.500> 2<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.920> might<00:03:27.310> not<00:03:27.400> pick<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.610> up<00:03:27.760> on

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
the iPad 2 it might not pick it up on

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.400 
the iPad 2 it might not pick it up on
the<00:03:27.880> camera<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:28.330> honestly<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.050> lot<00:03:29.170> lot

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
the camera but honestly it's a lot lot

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.170 
the camera but honestly it's a lot lot
louder<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.890> it's<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.250> strange<00:03:30.520> it's<00:03:31.060> an

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
louder and it's really strange it's an

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.940 
louder and it's really strange it's an
odd<00:03:31.360> thing<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:33.580> speed<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.660> iPad<00:03:35.200> 2<00:03:35.350> coming

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
odd thing the speed of the iPad 2 coming

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.720 
odd thing the speed of the iPad 2 coming
from<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:37.000> iPad<00:03:37.330> 2<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.870> iPad<00:03:38.200> air<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.730> it's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
from the iPad 2 to the iPad air is it's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.550 
from the iPad 2 to the iPad air is it's
just<00:03:39.880> leaps<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:40.480> bounds<00:03:40.780> above<00:03:40.870> opening

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
just leaps and bounds above opening

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.510 
just leaps and bounds above opening
applications<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.420> much<00:03:43.780> quicker<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:45.310> have

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
applications is so much quicker you have

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.190 
applications is so much quicker you have
no<00:03:46.320> particular<00:03:47.320> lag<00:03:47.890> at<00:03:48.100> all<00:03:49.020> whereas<00:03:50.020> with

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
no particular lag at all whereas with

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.350 
no particular lag at all whereas with
the<00:03:50.290> iPad<00:03:50.680> 2<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.220> would<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:51.580> a<00:03:51.610> lag<00:03:51.850> when

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
the iPad 2 you would have a lag when

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.910 
the iPad 2 you would have a lag when
you're<00:03:52.480> doing<00:03:52.780> screen<00:03:53.110> animations<00:03:53.680> and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
you're doing screen animations and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.120 
you're doing screen animations and
that's<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:55.150> lot<00:03:55.420> better<00:03:55.570> a<00:03:55.959> lot<00:03:56.500> quicker<00:03:56.740> the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
that's a lot better a lot quicker the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.040 
that's a lot better a lot quicker the
cameras<00:03:57.580> better<00:03:58.000> although<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.450> never<00:03:58.780> use<00:03:59.020> a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
cameras better although I never use a

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.770 
cameras better although I never use a
camera<00:03:59.350> on<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.800> iPad<00:03:59.920> air<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.600> hate

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
camera on the iPad air and and I hate

camera on the iPad air and and I hate
people<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.200> do<00:04:02.320> use<00:04:02.500> cameras<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:02.950> iPad<00:04:03.160> 2

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
people that do use cameras and iPad 2
