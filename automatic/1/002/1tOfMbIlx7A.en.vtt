00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
flag would suffice it pretty much does

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.500 
flag would suffice it pretty much does
the<00:00:41.070> same<00:00:41.280> thing<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.640> anyway<00:00:41.879> straight<00:00:42.329> up

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510

some<00:00:45.450> danger<00:00:45.840> close<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.860> puts<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> couple

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
some danger close you know puts a couple

kombat<00:00:47.730> x<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.030> 0<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.570> montage<00:00:48.899> clip

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
kombat x is 0 and get your montage clip

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
kombat x is 0 and get your montage clip
this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.829> fairly<00:00:50.070> easy<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.910> other

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this is fairly easy to do the other

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.700 
this is fairly easy to do the other
sides<00:00:51.329> even<00:00:51.780> easier<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
sides even easier because you have a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
sides even easier because you have a
lower<00:00:52.890> elevation<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.760> kombat<00:00:54.120> x<00:00:54.270> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
lower elevation so your kombat x is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.549 
lower elevation so your kombat x is
going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> travel<00:00:54.899> further<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> don't

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
going to travel further so you don't

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
going to travel further so you don't
have<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> throw<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.980> far<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.930> being

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
have to throw it far so with that being

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.310 
have to throw it far so with that being

of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> first<00:01:05.939> block<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.070> straight<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of the first block and straight up to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
of the first block and straight up to
see<00:01:08.729> flags<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
see flags so this one you can get to a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.670 
see flags so this one you can get to a
lot<00:01:10.560> quicker<00:01:10.770> than<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.939> other<00:01:12.090> side<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
lot quicker than the other side and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.600 
lot quicker than the other side and
again<00:01:13.680> i'd<00:01:13.890> recommend<00:01:14.310> putting<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.549> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
about this map and I just found out

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.940 
about this map and I just found out
about<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.959> yesterday<00:02:18.170> keep<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.739> mind<00:02:18.890> that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
about it yesterday keep in mind that

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.470 
about it yesterday keep in mind that
this<00:02:19.130> barrel<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.700> three-shot<00:02:20.120> even<00:02:20.390> with

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
this barrel is a three-shot even with

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.690 
this barrel is a three-shot even with
FMJ<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> DSR<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:22.580> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
FMJ with the DSR but what you can do is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.770 
FMJ with the DSR but what you can do is
straight<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.180> left<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.599> actually

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
straight to your left and it actually

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.600 
straight to your left and it actually
clips<00:02:24.260> away<00:02:24.530> all<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.860> objects<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> maps

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
clips away all the objects in the maps

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.199 
clips away all the objects in the maps
so<00:02:25.819> if<00:02:25.910> you're<00:02:26.030> playing<00:02:26.209> search<00:02:27.170> or<00:02:28.209> dom

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
so if you're playing search or dom

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.240 
so if you're playing search or dom
hardpoint<00:02:29.840> pretty<00:02:30.050> much<00:02:30.140> anything<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.800> can

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
hardpoint pretty much anything you can

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.130 
hardpoint pretty much anything you can
use<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.580> see<00:02:31.880> what<00:02:32.120> direction<00:02:32.540> everybody

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
use that to see what direction everybody

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.470 
use that to see what direction everybody
is<00:02:33.319> moving<00:02:33.560> across<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.580> map<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.330> you've<00:02:35.450> got

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
is moving across the map so you've got

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.030 
is moving across the map so you've got
the<00:02:35.750> Jets<00:02:35.989> here<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> lot<00:02:36.349> of<00:02:36.410> people<00:02:36.590> stand<00:02:36.920> up

headquarter<00:03:21.590> spot<00:03:21.799> over<00:03:21.980> there<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.310> different

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
headquarter spot over there so different

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.849 
headquarter spot over there so different
things<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.030> can<00:03:23.120> use<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.359> for<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:24.620> center

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
things you can use that for the center

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.259 
things you can use that for the center
planes<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.519> get<00:03:25.609> up<00:03:25.640> on<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:25.940> one<00:03:26.090> here<00:03:26.239> I

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
planes you can get up on this one here I

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.039 
planes you can get up on this one here I
don't<00:03:26.420> see<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.570> lot<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.720> people<00:03:26.959> up<00:03:27.019> here

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
don't see a lot of people up here

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.920 
don't see a lot of people up here
because<00:03:27.350> it's<00:03:27.440> not<00:03:27.560> near<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:28.010> much<00:03:28.040> cover<00:03:28.930> but

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
because it's not near as much cover but

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.000 
because it's not near as much cover but
this<00:03:30.590> plane<00:03:31.190> here<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:33.019> can<00:03:33.140> get<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.290> on<00:03:33.470> from<00:03:33.980> a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
this plane here you can get up on from a

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.440 
this plane here you can get up on from a
couple<00:03:34.280> different<00:03:34.400> directions<00:03:34.970> but<00:03:35.269> what's

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
couple different directions but what's

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
couple different directions but what's
really<00:03:35.569> nice<00:03:35.720> about<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:36.109> one<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.590> if<00:03:37.069> you

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
really nice about this one is if you

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.300 
really nice about this one is if you
prone<00:03:37.760> out<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:38.540> kind<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:38.900> concave<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:40.040> you've

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
prone out it's kind of concave so you've

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.129 
prone out it's kind of concave so you've
got<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.850> cover<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.690> your<00:03:41.780> left<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.079> your

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
got to cover for your left and your

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.960 
got to cover for your left and your
right<00:03:42.230> its<00:03:42.950> kind<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.310> protected<00:03:43.670> by<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.790> wing

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
right its kind of protected by the wing

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.430 
right its kind of protected by the wing
so<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.299> good<00:03:44.389> way<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.569> just<00:03:44.690> watch<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:45.230> watch

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
so it's a good way to just watch a watch

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.650 
so it's a good way to just watch a watch
see<00:03:45.739> although<00:03:46.639> you<00:03:46.790> do<00:03:47.000> kind<00:03:47.239> of<00:03:47.299> float<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.600> the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
see although you do kind of float in the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.420 
see although you do kind of float in the
air<00:03:47.690> when<00:03:47.959> you're<00:03:48.049> prone<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:49.100> got<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> little

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
air when you're prone you got the little

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.520 
air when you're prone you got the little
elbow<00:03:49.790> here<00:03:50.060> which<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> little<00:03:50.900> spawn<00:03:51.230> point

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
elbow here which is a little spawn point

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.690 
elbow here which is a little spawn point
and<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.769> know<00:03:51.829> a<00:03:51.920> lot<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.100> people<00:03:52.160> get<00:03:52.400> spawn

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
and I know a lot of people get spawn

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.280 
and I know a lot of people get spawn
