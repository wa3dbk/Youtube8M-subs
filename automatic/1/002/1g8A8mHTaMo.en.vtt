00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
with coach Jones well we you know we

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.910 
with coach Jones well we you know we

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
just got to be a little more effective

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.700 
just got to be a little more effective
than<00:02:16.490> they<00:02:17.030> were<00:02:17.560> particularly<00:02:18.560> at<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
than they were particularly at the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.050 
than they were particularly at the
beginning<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.160> last<00:02:19.340> year's<00:02:19.580> got<00:02:19.760> unusual

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
beginning of last year's got unusual

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.300 
beginning of last year's got unusual
situation<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> think<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.290> guarantee<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.100> and

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
situation I think we guarantee in and

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550 
situation I think we guarantee in and
not<00:02:22.760> getting<00:02:23.090> here<00:02:23.240> till<00:02:23.330> nearly<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.200> season

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
not getting here till nearly the season

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.980 
not getting here till nearly the season
start<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.010> all<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.300> think<00:02:26.840> they

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
start and all that so I I think they

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.440 
start and all that so I I think they
would<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.800> better<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:29.300> from

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
would just get better just from

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.360 
would just get better just from
experience<00:02:29.600> more<00:02:30.410> they<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.800> lot<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.160> young

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
experience more they a lot of young

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.730 
experience more they a lot of young
receivers<00:02:31.940> last<00:02:32.180> year<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.750> oh<00:02:32.990> yeah<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.590> know

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
receivers last year so oh yeah you know

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.140 
receivers last year so oh yeah you know
I<00:02:33.770> think<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.400> going<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.610> improve<00:02:34.700> quite<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
I think it's going to improve quite a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.699 
I think it's going to improve quite a
bit<00:02:35.360> i'm<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.690> going<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.870> try<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> add<00:02:36.470> my<00:02:36.680> two
