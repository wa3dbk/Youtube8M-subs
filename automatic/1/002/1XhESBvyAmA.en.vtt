there<00:02:58.160> might<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.459> plague<00:02:58.790> coming<00:02:59.239> yeah<00:03:00.170> yeah

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
there might be a plague coming yeah yeah

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.590 
there might be a plague coming yeah yeah
yeah<00:03:00.590> yeah<00:03:01.510> yeah<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:03.049> ugly<00:03:03.500> disease<00:03:03.830> saws

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
yeah yeah yeah it's ugly disease saws

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.690 
yeah yeah yeah it's ugly disease saws
bleeding<00:03:05.600> dying<00:03:05.870> generally<00:03:06.769> just<00:03:06.980> dying<00:03:07.190> deaf

now<00:03:08.359> that<00:03:08.570> makes<00:03:08.810> me<00:03:09.049> think<00:03:09.320> that<00:03:09.530> wouldn't<00:03:09.709> be

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
now that makes me think that wouldn't be

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.440 
now that makes me think that wouldn't be
a<00:03:09.859> great<00:03:10.070> time<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.370> live<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.239> could

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
a great time to live in but if you could

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.590 
a great time to live in but if you could
