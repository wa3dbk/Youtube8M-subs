difficult

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.839 

but<00:05:54.550> it<00:05:54.729> does<00:05:54.909> the<00:05:55.060> job<00:05:55.090> it's<00:05:55.719> um<00:05:56.050> very<00:05:56.849> good

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
but it does the job it's um very good

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:04.800 
but it does the job it's um very good
for<00:05:58.120> not<00:05:58.270> clumping<00:05:58.810> which<00:05:59.319> I<00:05:59.469> like

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:39.420 
kind of hard to control you have to
really<00:06:10.210> be<00:06:13.050> aware<00:06:14.050> where<00:06:14.470> you're<00:06:14.620> putting<00:06:14.830> it

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
and the last step in this would just be

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.470
