and<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> limited-edition<00:02:05.220> character

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and this is a limited-edition character

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.460 
and this is a limited-edition character
that<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.360> available<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:07.080> limited<00:02:07.200> time

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
that was available for a limited time

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.310 
that was available for a limited time
and<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.820> think<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.390> only<00:02:09.540> purchase<00:02:10.140> only

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
and I think it was only purchase only

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.160 
and I think it was only purchase only
before<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.250> could<00:02:11.820> be<00:02:11.970> wrong<00:02:12.210> or<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.960> was

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
before I could be wrong or it was

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.110 
before I could be wrong or it was
searchable<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.580> searchable<00:02:15.030> I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
searchable but now it's searchable I

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.410 
searchable but now it's searchable I
know<00:02:15.180> his<00:02:15.450> brother<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.870> think<00:02:16.050> his<00:02:16.470> brother<00:02:16.860> was

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that one you couldn't search for this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.060 
that one you couldn't search for this

here and go over here and we're gonna

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.480 
here and go over here and we're gonna
look<00:02:38.940> at<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.930> dragon<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:43.230> should<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:44.340> they

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
should give me a menu where I can they

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.920 
should give me a menu where I can they
like<00:02:47.340> what<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.940> actually<00:02:48.300> sort<00:02:48.570> out<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
like what I can actually sort out the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.100 
like what I can actually sort out the
Dragons<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.650> mean<00:02:49.890> at<00:02:50.310> least<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.900> they<00:02:51.900> made

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
Dragons I mean at least they they made

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.930 
Dragons I mean at least they they made
the<00:02:52.290> menu<00:02:52.530> bigger<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.550> bottom

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the menu bigger right so the bottom

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.490 
the menu bigger right so the bottom
there<00:02:54.300> should<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.570> something<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.870> sorting

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
there should be something like sorting

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.710 
there should be something like sorting
button<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.310> my<00:02:56.460> opinion<00:02:56.940> though<00:02:57.090> just

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
button that's in my opinion though just

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.810 
button that's in my opinion though just
like<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.020> hangar<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.770> there<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.790> a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
like the hangar but there it is it is a

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.820 
hour for fish and I'm just gonna say 1
million<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:12.209> obviously<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.620> it's

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
million because obviously you know it's

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.979 
million because obviously you know it's
near<00:03:14.100> there<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.520> it's<00:03:15.030> about<00:03:15.150> two<00:03:15.540> hours<00:03:15.570> and

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989

near there and it's about two hours and
five<00:03:16.140> minutes<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:17.550> shoots<00:03:17.910> fire<00:03:18.540> power<00:03:18.900> of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
five minutes and it shoots fire power of

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.020 
five minutes and it shoots fire power of
400<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.630> 77<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:22.190> don't<00:03:23.190> think<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.550> strong

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
400 in 77 I don't think it's that strong

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.300 
400 in 77 I don't think it's that strong
but<00:03:24.270> here's<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.780> baby<00:03:25.050> form<00:03:25.470> we're<00:03:26.190> gonna

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
but here's the baby form we're gonna

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.190 
but here's the baby form we're gonna
feed<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.360> as<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
feed it a bit and as you can see the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.560 
feed it a bit and as you can see the
fish<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.650> hanging<00:03:29.040> off<00:03:29.130> there<00:03:29.459> give<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.390> bit

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
fish is hanging off there give it a bit

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.710 
fish is hanging off there give it a bit
more<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.670> there<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.209> ring<00:03:33.390> cutter

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
more and there it is so the ring cutter

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
more and there it is so the ring cutter
it's<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.440> release<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:35.070> know<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.640> have<00:03:35.850> another

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
it's a release you know we have another

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.210 
it's a release you know we have another
ring<00:03:36.330> cutter<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.720> believe<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.980> ring

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
ring cutter I believe and that ring

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.580 
ring cutter I believe and that ring
cutter<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:38.790> about<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.300> same<00:03:39.480> size<00:03:39.750> it's

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
cutter is about the same size it's

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.130 
cutter is about the same size it's
really<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.520> small<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.600> think<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.959> gets

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
really really small and I think it gets

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.740 
really really small and I think it gets
in<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.470> way<00:03:43.709> easily<00:03:44.640> let's<00:03:45.000> go<00:03:45.150> back<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.510> here

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
in the way easily let's go back in here

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.750 
in the way easily let's go back in here
yeah<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.860> what<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.220> dragon<00:03:47.580> looks

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
yeah so this is what the dragon looks

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.130 
yeah so this is what the dragon looks

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
image this is the sketch this is the 3d

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.690 
image this is the sketch this is the 3d
render<00:03:52.640> of<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.940> game<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.040> it's<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.190> level<00:03:56.459> 3

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
