00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.279
 video-tutorial 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.080
 I'm going to apply how to make a cut of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.020
 steps that follow to do this a little 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.939
 can be applied to cosplay training in 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.280
 one day basically just for what I 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.710
 I know to make this cost of g 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.780
 which he did basically in a day in 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.900
 a few of now for today well let's 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.390
 to start at the beginning point number 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.970
 one the first thing you have to know is 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 a complete level is not to say that 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.989
 they want to make you a super armor a 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.020
 super suit with many meters of 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.620
 fabric there are its foundations at 2 m and super no 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.989
 There is no such 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.550
 I will not say that to me I would like 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.290
 make me a super mega armor that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.790
 can be does not stay as soon as I do not 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.680
 I have the necessary knowledge to 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.949
 can put an armor or wings 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.230
 articulable today such and such or first 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.870
 You must be consistent with what you 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.949
 you know once you know what you 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.140
 you know then you can use those 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.760
 knowledge if you do not know then it will touch you 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.310
 search and search and search and search in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.620
 brief floor then if this one could deny 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.440
 you're looking to make a monster that 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.530
 whether it is not quick to entertain you 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.580
 and such and such you have to know that you have 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.469
 that search a lot by google a lot 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.770
 tutorials many tutorials nobody is born 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.780
 knowing and you can not go to a forum and I'm going 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 to say it gaining buy and say I have never 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 made a complex you can tell how 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.640
 start 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 then the network and the first thing that you have 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.250
 what to do is look for doubt and as a second 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.740
 it is very easy to look for something in English and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.230
 look for concrete words can not say 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.150
 things we have no water left if you're looking 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.790
 in English and search for tutorials and search 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:02.510
 things is breaking down that cosplay by 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.190
 things already armor at home their wigs 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.800
 how to comb a wig like cut a 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.920
 wig when to cut the bangs and goes 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.599
 looking for him here playing English 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.599
 Well you will know many things 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 a series of pages where you can 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.830
 search for tutorials 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.129
 and it will come out a lot and with enough 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.410
 museum so I encourage we continue with the 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.780
 tutorial 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.570
 point number 2 once you know which one is 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.580
 your cosplayers level, check in your 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.280
 house the materials that tend to liquefy 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.460
 at the same time what is it that you can do that 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.620
 I do not know what I do not know how much for example 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.660
 for the cost of the fis as I have 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.610
 commented before what I did was 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.250
 obviously I noticed the point number 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.910
 one the level that I had the point 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.460
 number 2 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.040
 I started looking in the drawers of chests 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.290
 that I started to look like painting that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.660
 had the materials the rubber eva 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 amount of abhisit in some facing the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.370
 that did not want the end are many things 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.520
 the ones that put me to look to know what 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.620
 is what I could do in the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.470
 shortest possible time in order let's go to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.030
 point number 3 point number 3 what 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.300
 we will have to do is choose the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.480
 personal based on point number 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.430
 there are many many personals for example 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.500
 I know what my cosplay level is and what 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.200
 is my monetary level is a very something 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.330
 important to me I love this 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.040
 East Tripoli character 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.140
 I'm super in love with this character 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.730
 and basically of all the characters in 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.160
 triangles and a big fan of having 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.220
 titles and I like everything all the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.920
 characters all bring everything but I could 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.920
 take off my suit if I could get footage 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.050
 but I have the money to buy 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.940
 again 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.890
 I do not have enough money to 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.960
 have virtually none of the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.030
 costumes because I want them with some fabrics 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.740
 very specific I want to put pearls 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.100
 very specific 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.320
 it requires a lot of time invested in 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.600
 that suit are many things that make 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.420
 that I back down to do the 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.590
 try therefore as I said there is 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.470
 that know what is known and have a little 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.630
 of head well once you 've done the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.519
 point between them I have chosen the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.670
 character who is going to do what he has 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.860
 What to do is make a list in order 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.570
 what I usually do his old or as 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.290
 you want to call it, I usually print the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.570
 blue image to print in color and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.040
 next to the image I'm pointing out what 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.870
 I need it and what I do not need 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.010
 what I already have and how I could 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.010
 make duration of a left 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.569
 more or less based on that scheme 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.759
 then I'm applying the knowledge 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:50.810
 or if in case you do not know looking in 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:53.060
 how did I get to point number 4 and 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.979
 is reached number 3 we see and also 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.689
 the printed drawing what you give the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.550
 wins what has to be what less time 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.930
 you liked it now that you have in 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.789
 someone has to make a list of 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.780
 materials that have to be based on 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.419
 point number 2 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.419
 already said that in your house 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.919
 once you have that list what 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.169
 has to do is buy the internal 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:24.470
 obviously when you go to buy at 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:26.570
 Chinese because if not 20 euros 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.150
 here for example my city does not exist 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.889
 it is already Chinese 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.219
 recommendations gestures not to suffer a 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.710
 day is it worth to me to make an armor the advance 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.990
 of a partner can obviously make it 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.680
 word plan and I'm cheaper and I'm going to 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:47.069
 give something bigger I chose the rubber eva with 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.949
 the specific color and such is to say fix 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.840
 here I put again sad image 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.199
 It has a mature type of color 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.099
 gray and red buy me the color gomera 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.860
 gray of red color and then several 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:04.110
 cans or several silicone bags or 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.139
 hot glue and special room 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.779
 of this and that because it is done because 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.479
 if you're going to make a costume in coclÃ© or 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:14.490
 something and will do it in a very short time 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.490
 you have to take into account the time of 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.650
 dried against more Senate time 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.020
 have more time to lose do not lose 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.909
 that time they could but save with the 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.710
 colors of the rubber tail eva with that 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.310
 possibility that you already give that material 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.260
 point number 5 do not make mistakes is very 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.969
 easy to say it very complicated to do it 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.129
 if you are going to do it a little while 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.069
 it's not worth making a mistake that's like a 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:42.559
 advice as something that jahan said already 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.149
 he was asked how he was doing 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.429
 to do that is complete on that face 

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:49.059
 of quality with that career and in so little 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:51.739
 simply do not be wrong 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:53.479
 those are his words if you do not 

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:55.759
 you're wrong and you're not sure what 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.879
 they will do in each case the accomplice 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.409
 will come out only though if you're not 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.479
 sure if they will not know how to do it and such and 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.279
 which of course all this is linked to 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.049
 point number one and you know how it's going to 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.029
 make things back very safely to the 

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:10.249
 do it once you start to make mistakes 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.599
 have another failure I have two years already 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:15.409
 they will take longer than normal and it will 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.029
 turn into a slow project and into a 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.239
 project that you can add more 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:22.729
 Point number 6 is no longer just that you have 

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:24.919
 to start you can not stop in plan 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:27.709
 these are going to be if this does not stop 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.689
 as they do not do the start there 

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:32.330
 I start with the suit 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:33.709
 you get everything rolled really are the 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.679
 advice that I am at the time of making 

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:37.849
 cosplay time or any 

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:41.149
 conflict 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:43.189
 and well this is the the brief explanation 

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:45.439
 tutorial as you want to call it from 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:47.299
 understood with how to make a complex 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:49.129
 whatever you want to call it this applies to 

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:55.969
 the two types how to make a buy and 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:58.689
 buy nubia so it's good to ask 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.689
 down here 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.940
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.940
 goodbye
