00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
has one point five square kilometres so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.350 
has one point five square kilometres so
that's<00:02:14.900> why<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.380> need<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.830> DVI<00:02:16.280> technology<00:02:17.060> to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's why we need the DVI technology to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.070 
that's why we need the DVI technology to
do<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.780> inspection<00:02:18.620> why<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.640> care<00:02:20.480> about<00:02:20.600> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
do the inspection why we care about the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.559 
do the inspection why we care about the
