per<00:02:03.860> day<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.399> really<00:02:05.210> even<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.110> brings<00:02:06.409> in

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
per day and really even that brings in

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.770 
per day and really even that brings in
its<00:02:06.770> own<00:02:06.920> challenge<00:02:07.640> because<00:02:08.000> how<00:02:08.179> many<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.629> us

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
its own challenge because how many of us

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.149 
its own challenge because how many of us
are<00:02:08.869> able<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.379> fruits<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.799> vegetables

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
are able to get fruits and vegetables

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.220 
are able to get fruits and vegetables
that<00:02:10.279> are<00:02:10.340> picked<00:02:10.639> at<00:02:10.879> their<00:02:11.120> peak<00:02:11.870> of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
that are picked at their peak of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.250 
that are picked at their peak of
nutritional<00:02:12.950> maturity<00:02:13.489> how<00:02:14.480> often<00:02:14.779> are<00:02:14.989> they

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
nutritional maturity how often are they

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.640 
nutritional maturity how often are they
not<00:02:15.529> heated<00:02:16.430> or<00:02:16.669> prepared<00:02:17.209> or<00:02:17.650> transported

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
not heated or prepared or transported

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.549 
not heated or prepared or transported
long<00:02:18.829> distances<00:02:18.889> and<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:20.629> it's<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:21.019> careful

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:21.559 
long distances and so it's a careful

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.250 
long distances and so it's a careful
combination<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.790> how<00:02:23.510> we<00:02:23.569> treat<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.109> raw

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
combination of how we treat the raw

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.720 
combination of how we treat the raw
materials<00:02:24.799> where<00:02:25.010> we<00:02:25.129> get<00:02:25.309> those<00:02:25.489> raw

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
materials where we get those raw

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.179 
materials where we get those raw
materials<00:02:26.299> how<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:26.959> blend<00:02:27.409> them<00:02:27.620> together<00:02:27.799> to

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
materials how we blend them together to

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.000 
materials how we blend them together to
create<00:02:28.519> these<00:02:28.790> formulas<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.809> have<00:02:30.439> so<00:02:30.739> many

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
create these formulas that have so many

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.849 
create these formulas that have so many
benefits<00:02:31.699> to<00:02:31.819> offer<00:02:32.059> the<00:02:32.900> essentials<00:02:33.469> product

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
benefits to offer the essentials product

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.170 
benefits to offer the essentials product
is<00:02:33.949> a<00:02:34.510> antioxidant<00:02:35.510> product<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.079> some
