00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.309 
because I've looked at so many forums on
origin<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.030> I'll<00:02:57.359> actually<00:02:57.569> send<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.139> to

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
origin and I'll actually send this to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.020 
origin and I'll actually send this to
origin<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.639> make<00:02:59.669> this<00:02:59.970> a

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
origin and so they can make this a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.599 
origin and so they can make this a
tutorial
