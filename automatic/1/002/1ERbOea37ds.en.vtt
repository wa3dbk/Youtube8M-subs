like to show you our automatic control

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.599 
like to show you our automatic control
valve<00:00:34.659> which<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:34.960> referred<00:00:35.889> to<00:00:35.920> as<00:00:36.249> the<00:00:36.280> ad

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
valve which is referred to as the ad

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.809 
valve which is referred to as the ad
valve<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.989> ad<00:00:38.319> valve<00:00:38.620> has<00:00:38.889> three<00:00:38.920> settings<00:00:39.639> on

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:39.819 
valve the ad valve has three settings on

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.439 
valve the ad valve has three settings on
it<00:00:39.850> one<00:00:40.210> two<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:40.870> three<00:00:41.519> it<00:00:42.519> always<00:00:42.699> goes<00:00:43.120> out

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
it one two and three it always goes out

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.500 
it one two and three it always goes out
on<00:00:43.719> setting<00:00:44.620> number<00:00:44.739> two<00:00:45.069> which<00:00:45.370> we<00:00:45.549> find<00:00:45.819> is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
on setting number two which we find is

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.099 
on setting number two which we find is
much<00:00:46.809> probably<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.469> best<00:00:47.709> speed<00:00:48.010> if<00:00:49.109> your

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
much probably the best speed if your

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.430 
much probably the best speed if your
pump<00:00:50.409> is<00:00:50.589> not<00:00:51.100> very<00:00:51.370> strong<00:00:51.839> you<00:00:52.839> may<00:00:53.019> have<00:00:53.260> to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
pump is not very strong you may have to

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.119 
pump is not very strong you may have to
shift<00:00:53.649> this<00:00:53.859> to<00:00:53.920> go<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.369> number<00:00:55.329> three<00:00:55.359> setting

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
shift this to go to number three setting

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.119 
shift this to go to number three setting
but<00:00:57.129> if<00:00:57.249> your<00:00:57.429> pump<00:00:57.789> is<00:00:58.030> very<00:00:58.839> large<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.889> it's

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
but if your pump is very large and it's

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.949 
but if your pump is very large and it's
like<00:01:00.369> a<00:01:00.399> one<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:00.850> half<00:01:00.879> horsepower<00:01:01.299> pump

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
like a one and a half horsepower pump

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:06.270 
like a one and a half horsepower pump
you<00:01:02.739> may<00:01:02.979> need<00:01:03.279> to<00:01:03.639> slow<00:01:04.469> the<00:01:05.469> the<00:01:05.829> amount<00:01:06.159> of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
you may need to slow the the amount of

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.639 
you may need to slow the the amount of
water<00:01:06.549> going<00:01:06.939> through<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:08.049> actual<00:01:08.320> cleaner

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
water going through the actual cleaner

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.779 
water going through the actual cleaner
so<00:01:09.009> you'd<00:01:09.189> select<00:01:09.460> number<00:01:09.969> one<00:01:11.579> what<00:01:12.579> we're

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
so you'd select number one what we're

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.560 
so you'd select number one what we're
then<00:01:12.939> going<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.270> do<00:01:13.539> is<00:01:13.810> we're<00:01:14.530> going<00:01:14.859> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
then going to do is we're going to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.469 
then going to do is we're going to
adjust<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.770> right<00:01:18.009> amount<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.460> water<00:01:18.729> which

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
adjust the right amount of water which

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.310 
adjust the right amount of water which
will<00:01:19.659> go<00:01:19.869> through<00:01:20.229> your<00:01:20.500> mx8<00:01:21.240> cleaner<00:01:22.320> what

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
will go through your mx8 cleaner what

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
will go through your mx8 cleaner what
the<00:01:23.619> optimum<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.729> we<00:01:25.179> need<00:01:25.390> two<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:26.049> half

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the optimum is we need two and a half

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.249 
the optimum is we need two and a half
it'll<00:01:27.640> read<00:01:27.820> two<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.240> half<00:01:28.450> on<00:01:28.719> this<00:01:28.960> pool

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
it'll read two and a half on this pool

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.039 
it'll read two and a half on this pool
pulse<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:30.149> where<00:01:31.149> we<00:01:31.329> take<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.780> measurement

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
pulse and where we take that measurement

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
pulse and where we take that measurement
is<00:01:32.499> at<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.890> end<00:01:33.039> of<00:01:33.249> the<00:01:33.399> hose<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:34.659> prior<00:01:34.990> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
is at the end of the hose just prior to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.800 
is at the end of the hose just prior to
where<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.090> actual<00:01:37.570> head<00:01:38.439> of<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.740> mx8

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
where the actual head of the mx8

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.050 
where the actual head of the mx8
attaches<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.259> hose<00:01:41.609> it<00:01:42.609> is<00:01:42.670> most

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
attaches to the hose it is most

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510 
attaches to the hose it is most
important<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:44.020> do<00:01:44.350> take<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.920> hose<00:01:45.130> out<00:01:45.490> of

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
important you do take the hose out of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.809 
important you do take the hose out of
the<00:01:45.850> water<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.619> have<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.130> have<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.579> pump

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
the water you have to have the pump

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.330 
the water you have to have the pump
switched<00:01:49.210> off<00:01:49.740> otherwise<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:51.039> going<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.280> be

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
switched off otherwise it's going to be

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:07.029 
switched off otherwise it's going to be
sucking<00:01:51.789> here<00:01:51.999> through<00:01:52.840> your<00:01:53.020> system

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.469 

what<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.060> start<00:02:09.390> your

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
what you do now is then you start your

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.790 
what you do now is then you start your
pump<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.430> then<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.760> read<00:02:12.120> where<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
pump up and then you read where the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.120 
pump up and then you read where the
actual<00:02:14.100> indicator<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.650> what<00:02:16.950> you're

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
actual indicator is so that what you're

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.170 
actual indicator is so that what you're
wanting<00:02:17.489> for<00:02:17.760> perfect<00:02:18.410> suction<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.700> 2.5<00:02:20.700> as

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
wanting for perfect suction is 2.5 as

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.460 
wanting for perfect suction is 2.5 as
you<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.440> there<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.819> now<00:02:24.330> reading<00:02:25.260> too

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
you can see there it is now reading too

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.520 
you can see there it is now reading too
low<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.069> only<00:02:26.370> reading<00:02:26.880> one<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.360> half<00:02:27.600> as

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
low it is only reading one and a half as

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.830 
low it is only reading one and a half as
you<00:02:29.070> saw<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.640> pull<00:02:29.880> pulse<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> reading

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you saw on the pull pulse of the reading

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.100 
you saw on the pull pulse of the reading
was<00:02:30.989> less<00:02:31.230> than<00:02:31.560> 2.5<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:33.330> therefore<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
was less than 2.5 we therefore have to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.440 
was less than 2.5 we therefore have to
increase<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.040> amount<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.459> suction<00:02:35.700> which

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
increase the amount of suction which

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.860 
increase the amount of suction which
passes<00:02:37.019> through<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.440> mx8<00:02:37.980> head<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.600> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
passes through the mx8 head to do that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.850 
passes through the mx8 head to do that
what<00:02:40.769> we<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.670> go<00:02:42.000> from<00:02:42.269> 2<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
what we have to do is go from 2 on the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.890 
what we have to do is go from 2 on the
ad<00:02:44.040> valve<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:45.269> setting<00:02:46.140> number<00:02:46.650> 3<00:02:47.600> as<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.750> can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
ad valve to setting number 3 as you can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.380 
ad valve to setting number 3 as you can
see<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.680> setting<00:02:50.250> number<00:02:50.400> 3

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.720 

that<00:02:56.990> will<00:02:57.140> increase<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.740> suction<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.460> as<00:02:58.580> we

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that will increase the suction so as we

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.880 
that will increase the suction so as we
should<00:02:58.790> be<00:02:59.060> able<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.330> get<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.540> reading<00:02:59.990> of<00:03:00.110> 2.5

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
should be able to get a reading of 2.5

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.949 
should be able to get a reading of 2.5
as<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:02.300> can<00:03:02.450> see<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.140> now<00:03:03.700> 4.5<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.540> ideal

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
as you can see it is now 4.5 the ideal

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.850 
as you can see it is now 4.5 the ideal
setting<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.590> 2.5<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.959> what<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.319> have<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.709> do

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
setting is 2.5 so what we have to do

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.840 
setting is 2.5 so what we have to do
then<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.310> go<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.700> our<00:03:11.080> relief<00:03:12.080> valve<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.820> can

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
then is go to our relief valve you can

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.320 
then is go to our relief valve you can
see<00:03:14.120> number<00:03:14.300> one<00:03:14.450> sitting<00:03:15.020> there<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:17.209> we

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
see number one sitting there and we

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.840 
see number one sitting there and we
change<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.840> from<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.200> number<00:03:18.350> 2<00:03:18.680> setting<00:03:19.100> to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
change it from the number 2 setting to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.510 
change it from the number 2 setting to
the<00:03:19.970> number<00:03:20.300> 1<00:03:20.870> setting<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:24.860> then<00:03:25.130> will<00:03:25.340> then

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
the number 1 setting this then will then

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.050 
the number 1 setting this then will then
give<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.819> 2.5<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.440> pool<00:03:27.650> pulse<00:03:27.940> which<00:03:28.940> is

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
give you 2.5 on the pool pulse which is

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.630 
give you 2.5 on the pool pulse which is
the<00:03:29.209> perfect<00:03:29.660> suction<00:03:30.080> for<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.770> mx8<00:03:31.310> cleaner

when you take it out of the pool you

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.550 
when you take it out of the pool you
have<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.430> disconnect<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.600> hose<00:04:41.840> from<00:04:42.350> the

have to disconnect the hose from the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.219 
have to disconnect the hose from the
cleaner<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.340> keep<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.729> hose<00:04:43.940> straight<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:45.200> I

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
cleaner and keep the hose straight so I

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.990 
cleaner and keep the hose straight so I
hope<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.560> these<00:04:45.950> two<00:04:46.520> tips<00:04:46.820> have<00:04:46.970> been

valuable information for you remembering
that<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.380> must<00:04:51.620> have<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.979> correct<00:04:52.250> flow

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
that you must have the correct flow

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.190 
that you must have the correct flow

out<00:04:58.840> of<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.050> pool<00:04:59.490> make<00:05:00.490> sure<00:05:00.730> that<00:05:00.910> you

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
out of the pool make sure that you

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.240 
out of the pool make sure that you
