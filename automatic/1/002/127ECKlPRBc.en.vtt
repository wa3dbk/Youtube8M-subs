00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.310 
notch top knot okay let's talk about top
notch<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:43.579> first<00:00:44.480> of<00:00:44.660> all<00:00:44.780> what's<00:00:44.989> under<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
notch and first of all what's under the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.319 
notch and first of all what's under the

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
hood because you have got an enormous

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.360 
hood because you have got an enormous
engine<00:00:48.140> in<00:00:48.230> there<00:00:48.379> yeah<00:00:48.949> we've<00:00:49.160> got<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
engine in there yeah we've got the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.139 
engine in there yeah we've got the
coyote<00:00:49.960> Ford<00:00:50.960> Racing<00:00:51.550> illuminator<00:00:52.550> motor<00:00:52.820> and

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
coyote Ford Racing illuminator motor and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.860 
coyote Ford Racing illuminator motor and
that's<00:00:53.780> an<00:00:53.930> all<00:00:54.109> forged<00:00:54.710> internal<00:00:55.309> four<00:00:56.059> crate

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
that's an all forged internal four crate

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.810 
that's an all forged internal four crate
motor<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:57.800> then<00:00:57.920> we've<00:00:58.070> coupled<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:58.519> with<00:00:58.579> a

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
motor and then we've coupled that with a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.900 
motor and then we've coupled that with a
Vortech<00:00:59.660> JT<00:01:00.079> Tran<00:01:00.469> blower<00:01:00.769> which<00:01:01.519> that

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
Vortech JT Tran blower which that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.900 
Vortech JT Tran blower which that
combination<00:01:02.239> equals<00:01:03.230> about<00:01:03.320> 855<00:01:04.280> rear-wheel

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
combination equals about 855 rear-wheel

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.590 
combination equals about 855 rear-wheel
horsepower<00:01:04.940> at<00:01:05.930> only<00:01:06.140> 6,800<00:01:06.920> rpm<00:01:07.280> okay<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:07.910> for

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
horsepower at only 6,800 rpm okay so for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.690 
horsepower at only 6,800 rpm okay so for
a<00:01:08.630> road<00:01:08.930> race<00:01:09.200> car<00:01:09.500> I'm<00:01:09.920> wondering<00:01:10.400> how<00:01:10.550> much

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
a road race car I'm wondering how much

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.400 
a road race car I'm wondering how much
better<00:01:11.090> traction<00:01:11.750> you're<00:01:11.990> getting<00:01:12.170> with<00:01:12.260> that

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
better traction you're getting with that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.840 
better traction you're getting with that
kind<00:01:12.620> of<00:01:12.650> horsepower<00:01:12.800> but<00:01:13.250> we're<00:01:13.610> still<00:01:13.790> in

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
kind of horsepower but we're still in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.490 
kind of horsepower but we're still in
the<00:01:13.910> development<00:01:14.300> of<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.630> car<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:15.290> we've

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
the development of the car but we've

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.250 
the development of the car but we've
revamped<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.550> car<00:01:16.700> for<00:01:16.940> this<00:01:17.030> year<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.630> done

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
revamped the car for this year and done

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.900 
revamped the car for this year and done
a<00:01:18.290> lot<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.590> aerodynamic<00:01:19.130> work<00:01:19.280> with<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> PR

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
a lot of aerodynamic work with a PR

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.790 
a lot of aerodynamic work with a PR
performance<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.050> aero<00:01:21.290> package<00:01:21.500> on

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
performance and so the aero package on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.650 
performance and so the aero package on
this<00:01:21.920> car<00:01:22.100> traumatically<00:01:22.940> change<00:01:23.450> its

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
this car traumatically change its

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.390 
this car traumatically change its
characteristics<00:01:24.050> on<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.470> track<00:01:24.830> with<00:01:25.280> this

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
characteristics on the track with this

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.310 
characteristics on the track with this
coyote<00:01:25.640> engine<00:01:25.790> you've<00:01:26.150> shoved<00:01:26.660> it<00:01:26.840> all<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
coyote engine you've shoved it all the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.620 
coyote engine you've shoved it all the
white<00:01:27.470> back<00:01:27.830> into<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.340> economy<00:01:28.490> yes<00:01:29.390> we

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
white back into the economy yes we

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.210 
white back into the economy yes we
wanted<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:29.990> try<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.230> get<00:01:30.470> 50/50<00:01:31.130> weight

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
wanted to try to get 50/50 weight

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.710 
wanted to try to get 50/50 weight
distribution<00:01:31.400> out<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:31.970> car<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.510> so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
distribution out of this car and so

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.650 
distribution out of this car and so
those<00:01:33.710> are<00:01:33.860> actually<00:01:33.980> 2014<00:01:34.790> Mustang<00:01:35.420> hood

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
those are actually 2014 Mustang hood

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.020 
those are actually 2014 Mustang hood
vents<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.260> we<00:01:36.590> use<00:01:36.860> them<00:01:37.070> on<00:01:37.160> our<00:01:37.340> fenders<00:01:37.760> to
