00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
alright so we are kind of low health and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.990 
alright so we are kind of low health and
I<00:00:57.250> did<00:00:57.400> add<00:00:57.520> to<00:00:57.730> use<00:00:57.970> ignite<00:00:58.630> I<00:00:59.910> generally<00:01:00.910> like

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
I did add to use ignite I generally like

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.200 
I did add to use ignite I generally like
to<00:01:01.060> do<00:01:01.270> things<00:01:01.740> smite<00:01:02.740> list<00:01:02.950> but<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.880> is<00:01:04.030> all

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
to do things smite list but that is all

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.870 
to do things smite list but that is all
right<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.980> instead<00:01:05.980> I<00:01:06.220> ended<00:01:06.340> up<00:01:06.520> getting<00:01:06.670> my

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
right and instead I ended up getting my

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.250 
right and instead I ended up getting my
w<00:01:07.150> instead<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.510> my<00:01:07.600> e<00:01:09.750> gives<00:01:10.750> me<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> little<00:01:11.080> bit

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
w instead of my e gives me a little bit

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.200 
w instead of my e gives me a little bit
of<00:01:11.440> passive<00:01:12.100> attack<00:01:12.400> speed<00:01:12.730> so<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.090> think

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
of passive attack speed so I think

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.440 
of passive attack speed so I think
that's<00:01:13.480> a<00:01:13.570> little<00:01:13.630> bit<00:01:13.840> better<00:01:13.990> ah<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:19.330> we

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
mean the e isn't horrible gives a nice

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.720 
mean the e isn't horrible gives a nice
um<00:02:48.060> slow<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.470> The<00:02:50.470> Ultimates<00:02:50.920> pretty<00:02:51.190> cool<00:02:51.430> so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
um slow and The Ultimates pretty cool so

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.680 
um slow and The Ultimates pretty cool so
I<00:02:51.760> think<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.299> could<00:02:52.390> do<00:02:52.480> something

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
I think that you could do something

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.500 
I think that you could do something
pretty<00:02:52.989> cool<00:02:53.049> with<00:02:53.290> her<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.440> think<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.890> I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
pretty cool with her I think that I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.990 
pretty cool with her I think that I
think<00:02:55.510> she<00:02:55.660> could<00:02:55.900> jungle<00:02:56.320> but<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.940> would

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
think she could jungle but I think would

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.160 
think she could jungle but I think would
be<00:02:58.090> something<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.690> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> mess<00:02:59.049> around

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
be something just to kind of mess around

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.319 
be something just to kind of mess around
with<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.769> little<00:02:59.920> bit<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.130> fun<00:03:00.370> about
