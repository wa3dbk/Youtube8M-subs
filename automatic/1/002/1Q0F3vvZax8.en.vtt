00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
your back is employed and it's going to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.680 
your back is employed and it's going to
spill<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:49.010> brake<00:02:49.430> fluid<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.970> don't<00:02:50.510> want<00:02:50.630> to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
spill that brake fluid I don't want to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.759 
spill that brake fluid I don't want to
go<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.870> over<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> tank<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.380> don't<00:02:51.590> want<00:02:51.709> it

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
go and over the tank I don't want it

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.520 
go and over the tank I don't want it
going<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.130> engine<00:02:52.430> factor<00:02:52.760> onyx<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.150> stay

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
going on the engine factor onyx to stay

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.190 
going on the engine factor onyx to stay
right<00:02:54.530> where<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.810> i<00:02:57.049> will

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
right where it is in there so i will

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.940 
right where it is in there so i will
attach<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.970> you'll<00:02:58.970> shove<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.360> over<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
attach this you'll shove it over the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.880 
attach this you'll shove it over the
bleed<00:03:00.950> nipple<00:03:01.310> s<00:03:01.519> so<00:03:02.560> important<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> get<00:03:03.739> this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
bleed nipple s so important to get this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.380 
bleed nipple s so important to get this
top<00:03:04.130> top<00:03:04.310> because<00:03:04.459> if<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:04.730> reservoir<00:03:05.120> runs

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
top top because if this reservoir runs

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.940 
top top because if this reservoir runs
out<00:03:05.600> we're<00:03:05.780> just<00:03:05.930> basically<00:03:06.440> going<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:06.890> be

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
out we're just basically going to be

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.190 
out we're just basically going to be
pumping<00:03:07.459> air<00:03:07.670> into<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.570> system<00:03:08.930> which<00:03:09.049> is

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
pumping air into the system which is

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.229 
pumping air into the system which is
just<00:03:09.380> what<00:03:09.620> we<00:03:09.739> don't<00:03:09.859> want<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.120> I've

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
just what we don't want to do so I've

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.690 
just what we don't want to do so I've
got<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.450> year<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.950> tube<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.400> bleed

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
got the year the tube on the bleed

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.940 
got the year the tube on the bleed
nipple<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.750> all<00:03:15.140> they<00:03:15.230> do<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:15.769> dripping

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
nipple and all they do is just dripping

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.550 
nipple and all they do is just dripping
down<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.549> collection<00:03:17.030> yeah<00:03:17.500> okay<00:03:18.500> so

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
down this collection yeah okay so

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.300 
down this collection yeah okay so
opening<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:20.090> bleed<00:03:20.299> valve<00:03:20.980> still<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> air

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
opening the bleed valve still the air

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.190 
opening the bleed valve still the air
coming<00:03:22.609> through<00:03:22.820> there<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.720> then<00:03:24.019> I'm<00:03:24.109> going

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
coming through there and then I'm going

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.699 
coming through there and then I'm going
to<00:03:24.260> pump<00:03:24.470> all<00:03:24.739> right<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:27.079> sleep<00:03:27.320> great

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
to pump all right we can sleep great

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.110 
to pump all right we can sleep great
fluid<00:03:28.070> coming<00:03:28.250> out<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:28.670> it's<00:03:28.790> full<00:03:29.030> of

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
fluid coming out but it's full of

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.990 
fluid coming out but it's full of
bubbles<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:31.489> want<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.700> keep<00:03:31.730> going

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
bubbles and we just want to keep going

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.440 
bubbles and we just want to keep going
at<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:33.579> get<00:03:34.579> all<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.760> because<00:03:35.120> that's<00:03:35.239> all

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
at that get all that because that's all

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.729 
at that get all that because that's all
the<00:03:35.600> air<00:03:35.720> that's<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.170> system<00:03:36.560> at<00:03:36.650> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
the air that's in the system at the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.160 
the air that's in the system at the
moment<00:03:39.100> keep<00:03:40.100> pumping<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.670> out<00:03:41.049> keeping<00:03:42.049> an

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
moment keep pumping that out keeping an

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.440 
moment keep pumping that out keeping an
eye<00:03:42.260> on<00:03:42.290> me<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:43.220> brake<00:03:43.430> reservoir<00:03:43.609> as<00:03:43.970> well<00:03:44.150> I

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
eye on me the brake reservoir as well I

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.780 
eye on me the brake reservoir as well I
don't<00:03:44.720> want<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.989> run<00:03:45.109> out<00:03:45.260> coming<00:03:45.859> down<00:03:46.040> that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
don't want to run out coming down that

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.979 
don't want to run out coming down that
half<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:48.049> have<00:03:48.109> on<00:03:48.230> both<00:03:48.380> sides<00:03:48.709> off<00:03:48.920> today<00:03:49.280> and

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
half to have on both sides off today and

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.890 
half to have on both sides off today and
basically<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.410> system<00:03:51.739> is<00:03:51.859> empty<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:53.720> with

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
basically the system is empty so with

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.860 
basically the system is empty so with
effectively<00:03:54.880> replacing<00:03:55.880> all<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.060> brake

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
effectively replacing all the brake

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.259 
effectively replacing all the brake
fluid<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:58.220> this<00:03:58.340> mix<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.670> up<00:03:58.730> stuff<00:03:59.090> air

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
fluid and this mix that up stuff air

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.720 
fluid and this mix that up stuff air
coming<00:03:59.480> back<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.889> and<00:04:00.889> just<00:04:00.920> keep<00:04:01.220> topping<00:04:01.579> up

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.339 

okay<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.230> then<00:04:07.379> we'll<00:04:07.530> do<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.739> all<00:04:07.830> again<00:04:09.349> open

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
okay and then we'll do it all again open

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.050 
okay and then we'll do it all again open
the<00:04:10.470> brake<00:04:11.099> valve<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.299> bleed<00:04:12.989> valve

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
the brake valve but so the bleed valve

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.909 
the brake valve but so the bleed valve
start<00:04:15.060> pumping<00:04:15.450> away<00:04:17.750> we'll<00:04:18.750> start<00:04:19.019> pumping

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
start pumping away we'll start pumping

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.960 
start pumping away we'll start pumping
clear<00:04:20.639> fluid<00:04:21.060> row<00:04:22.040> like<00:04:23.040> brake<00:04:23.400> fluid<00:04:23.729> without

coming out of that because they're

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.159 
coming out of that because they're
compress<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:49.460> quite<00:04:50.460> easily<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.750> liquid

compress it quite easily and liquid

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.920 
compress it quite easily and liquid
doesn't<00:04:55.220> drop<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.490> ass<00:04:56.840> through<00:04:57.840> the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
color of that ya ass was crap nice and

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.490 
color of that ya ass was crap nice and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.240 
system that will come back to that one
and<00:05:12.320> it's<00:05:13.320> just<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.590> question<00:05:13.710> of<00:05:13.889> repeating

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
and it's just a question of repeating

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.730 
and it's just a question of repeating
that<00:05:14.340> on<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.520> other<00:05:14.639> side<00:05:15.470> keeping<00:05:16.470> an<00:05:16.590> eye<00:05:16.710> on

a bit this side a bit that side of it
this<00:05:24.090> side<00:05:24.389> until<00:05:25.639> we<00:05:26.639> get<00:05:26.760> brake<00:05:27.000> pressure

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419

back<00:05:27.930> up<00:05:28.080> again<00:05:28.669> I'm<00:05:29.669> find<00:05:30.030> that<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.240> if<00:05:30.450> the

back up again I'm find that the if the
brakes<00:05:30.780> work<00:05:30.990> okay<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:32.280> very<00:05:32.460> important

a question of their leading each side

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.290 
a question of their leading each side
out<00:06:35.970> that's<00:06:36.970> almost<00:06:37.330> done<00:06:38.520> on<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.699> other<00:06:39.849> side

bit little bit a side a little and often
and<00:06:51.759> see<00:06:52.630> as<00:06:52.750> all<00:06:52.960> out<00:06:53.169> start<00:06:53.860> to<00:06:53.949> feel
