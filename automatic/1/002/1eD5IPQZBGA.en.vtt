here is the red light on the stop sensor

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.860 
here is the red light on the stop sensor
if<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:59.040> sensor<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.459> triggered<00:02:59.790> which<00:03:00.630> means

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
if the sensor is triggered which means

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.360 
if the sensor is triggered which means
it<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.080> hovering<00:03:01.230> above<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.040> stopped

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it is hovering above one of the stopped

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.050 
it is hovering above one of the stopped
bolts<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.630> light<00:03:03.810> will<00:03:03.989> turn<00:03:04.019> off<00:03:04.470> thus<00:03:05.370> it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
bolts the light will turn off thus it

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.790 
bolts the light will turn off thus it
provides<00:03:06.480> an<00:03:06.630> easy<00:03:06.810> way<00:03:07.019> for<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.380> tell<00:03:07.560> if
