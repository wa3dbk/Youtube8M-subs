00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
because deter semi-final in the gasoline

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.020 
because deter semi-final in the gasoline
for<00:02:41.940> sure<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.950> mean<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> first<00:02:44.700> think

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
for sure but I mean the first think

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
for sure but I mean the first think
maybe<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:45.989> we<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.470> experience<00:02:46.650> we

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
maybe that now we have the experience we

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.770 
maybe that now we have the experience we
have<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.940> motion<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.450> play<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
have all the motion to play the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.250 
have all the motion to play the
semi-final<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:50.850> know<00:02:51.030> how<00:02:51.269> how<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.930> play

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
semi-final so we know how how to play

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.310 
semi-final so we know how how to play
and<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:53.190> second<00:02:53.489> thing<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:54.000> course<00:02:54.300> we<00:02:55.140> would

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
and the second thing of course we would

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.870 
and the second thing of course we would
like<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.530> reach<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.980> first<00:02:56.190> final<00:02:56.550> because

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
like to reach the first final because

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.060 
like to reach the first final because
it's<00:02:57.060> something<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.690> mean<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.920> big

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
it's something I mean it's a big

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's something I mean it's a big
different<00:02:59.489> between<00:03:00.200> semi-final<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.290> final

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
different between semi-final and final

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.080 
different between semi-final and final
so<00:03:01.830> for<00:03:02.760> sure<00:03:02.970> we're<00:03:03.120> gonna<00:03:03.300> try<00:03:03.480> our<00:03:03.510> best<00:03:03.959> and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so for sure we're gonna try our best and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.549 
so for sure we're gonna try our best and
