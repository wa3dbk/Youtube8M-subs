got an excellent driver and we've got an
actually<00:01:45.729> an<00:01:45.819> excellent<00:01:46.179> team<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.569> we're

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
actually an excellent team and we're

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.600 
actually an excellent team and we're
just<00:01:46.720> looking<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.170> some<00:01:47.259> funding<00:01:47.619> do<00:01:48.399> you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
just looking for some funding do you

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.969

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
have to tune this car conservatively

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.859 
have to tune this car conservatively
because<00:01:51.819> of<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.030> fact<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.509> don't<00:01:52.630> have

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
because of the fact that you don't have

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.600 
because of the fact that you don't have
a<00:01:52.899> lot<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.140> extra<00:01:53.740> stuff<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.070> put<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.399> if<00:01:54.520> you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
a lot of extra stuff to put it in if you

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.730 
a lot of extra stuff to put it in if you
start<00:01:54.850> breaking<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.299> oh<00:01:55.450> absolutely<00:01:56.079> it's<00:01:56.680> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
start breaking it oh absolutely it's a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.840 
start breaking it oh absolutely it's a
little<00:01:56.950> conservative<00:01:57.280> but<00:01:57.610> it's<00:01:57.729> still

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
little conservative but it's still

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.420 
little conservative but it's still
pretty<00:01:57.909> fast<00:01:58.530> obviously<00:01:59.530> he<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.159> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
pretty fast obviously he is and the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.980 
pretty fast obviously he is and the
whole<00:02:00.579> irony<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.240> thing<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.810> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
whole irony of this thing is is that
