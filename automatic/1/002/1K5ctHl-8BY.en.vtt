that step they've started with sugar all
right<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.110> they<00:01:21.200> confirm<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.740> by<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:21.950> way<00:01:22.100> soon

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
right so they confirm it by the way soon

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.620 
right so they confirm it by the way soon
as<00:01:22.430> they<00:01:22.580> put<00:01:22.760> water<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.240> sugar<00:01:23.450> they

as they put water on the sugar they

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.090 
as they put water on the sugar they
confirm<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.110> they<00:01:24.470> already<00:01:24.590> have<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> sugar

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
confirm it they already have the sugar

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.620 
confirm it they already have the sugar
but<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.700> course<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:25.909> least<00:01:26.210> sort<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.510> thought

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
but of course that least sort of thought

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.500 
but of course that least sort of thought
out<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.900> doesn't<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.710> flavor<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.450> way

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
out that doesn't have in flavor the way

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.899 
out that doesn't have in flavor the way
they<00:01:29.659> be<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.810> flavor<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.560> put<00:01:30.830> through<00:01:31.280> sugar

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
they be a flavor is to put through sugar

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.190 
they be a flavor is to put through sugar
and<00:01:32.180> all<00:01:32.270> those<00:01:32.360> other<00:01:32.510> things<00:01:32.750> into<00:01:33.020> this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
put it directly into the still what we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.500 
put it directly into the still what we
do<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.710> called<00:02:04.950> vapor<00:02:05.130> infusion<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.940> as<00:02:06.390> the

do is called vapor infusion and as the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.639 
do is called vapor infusion and as the
data<00:02:06.690> travels<00:02:07.140> i'll<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.710> it'll<00:02:08.340> hit<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
data travels i'll do that it'll hit the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.420 
data travels i'll do that it'll hit the
