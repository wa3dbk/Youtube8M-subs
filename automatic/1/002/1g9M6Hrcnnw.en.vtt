they came along with the coated strings
a<00:01:12.299> little<00:01:12.359> bit<00:01:12.780> later<00:01:13.020> than<00:01:13.289> everyone<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.310> fact

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
a little bit later than everyone in fact

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.730 
a little bit later than everyone in fact
a<00:01:14.880> lot<00:01:15.210> later<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.929> couple<00:01:16.289> of<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.560> other

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a lot later than a couple of the other

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.719 
a lot later than a couple of the other
outfits<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.170> they<00:01:19.170> took<00:01:19.350> their<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
outfits but they took their time kind of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.450 
outfits but they took their time kind of
like<00:01:21.170> when<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> couple<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> work<00:01:23.189> bucks

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
like when you put a couple of work bucks

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.249 
like when you put a couple of work bucks
in<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.999> take<00:01:24.179> your<00:01:24.359> time<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.109> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
in here you take your time and you do it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.480 
in here you take your time and you do it
right<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:25.859> they've<00:01:26.130> done<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.310> good

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
right and I think they've done a good

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
right and I think they've done a good
job<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.359> I<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.749> haven't<00:01:28.170> often<00:01:28.619> been<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
job now I would haven't often been a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.090 
job now I would haven't often been a
proponent<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> coated<00:01:30.240> strings<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.469> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
proponent of the coated strings but I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
proponent of the coated strings but I
think<00:01:32.789> in<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.090> summer<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.719> you're<00:01:33.869> talking

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
think in the summer when you're talking

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.480 
think in the summer when you're talking
about<00:01:34.320> chicken<00:01:35.310> grease<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.030> pork<00:01:36.390> fat

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
about chicken grease and pork fat

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.690 
about chicken grease and pork fat
mojitos<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.350> margaritas<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.770> various

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
mojitos and margaritas and various

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.429 
mojitos and margaritas and various
exchanges<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.509> fluids<00:01:42.929> which<00:01:43.200> can

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
exchanges of fluids which can

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.929 
exchanges of fluids which can
spontaneously<00:01:43.710> occur<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.729> summer

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
spontaneously occur in the summer

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.719 
spontaneously occur in the summer
environments<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.289> have<00:01:46.319> to<00:01:46.979> consider<00:01:47.460> your
