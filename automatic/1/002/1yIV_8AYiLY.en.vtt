00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.930
 Unity Christian 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.930
 That's our biggest challenge 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.760
 when things do not run our nose anymore when we are a giant 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.620
 Disappointment when someone annoys us when we have the most beautiful day 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.620
 experience our life 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.490
 Years nothing negative to say 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 he is not a challenge 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.719
 In John 16, 33, Jesus gives us a hint 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 as he says, "in the world you have tribulation 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 but be confident 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.740
 that I overcame the world that was his good advice for all of us 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.679
 issues 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.969
 he explains in other words it will happen DAB Bank and become things 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.820
 we do not like it 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.530
 every single thing will happen to many not like you can not in 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.160
 to be in a relationship and expect the other to always satisfy you 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.680
 can always be something 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.540
 you will not find a perfect preacher for a perfect church 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.640
 perfect job no perfect forehand 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.450
 this is not a perfect neighborhood, Trondheim perfect for the house 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 Â«We live in a world that is not perfect 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.980
 but to my knowledge, Jesus does not constantly have child support 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.439
 Voldemort 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.899
 no matter what happened he always stayed the same it is interesting that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.919
 the Bible and then tells times where he purposely did not say anything 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.799
 maybe here is the statement if you can not say anything good you should 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.289
 better not say a new danger i believe if we are special 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.289
 feeling stressed then we should not say better 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.000
 and walls of not getting along in the company of others then you go 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.860
 somewhere where no one was called 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.440
 Media can talk
