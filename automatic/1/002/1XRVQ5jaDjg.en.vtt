00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.140 
have to get 18k to get his a MP you just
keep<00:02:01.409> capturing<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.740> flag<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.460> get<00:02:03.610> as<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.820> MP

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
keep capturing the flag to get as a MP

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.390 
keep capturing the flag to get as a MP
you<00:02:04.720> know<00:02:04.840> once<00:02:05.050> you've<00:02:05.530> both<00:02:05.740> got<00:02:06.010> your<00:02:06.190> kill

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
you know once you've both got your kill

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.889 
you know once you've both got your kill
streaks<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.820> want<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.090> go<00:02:07.180> or<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> do<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:09.899> put

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
streaks you want to go or I do and put

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.050 
streaks you want to go or I do and put
the<00:02:10.989> flag<00:02:11.290> there<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:12.579> run<00:02:12.760> onto<00:02:12.939> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the flag there and then run onto the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.760 
the flag there and then run onto the
flag<00:02:13.299> at<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.480> same

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
flag at the same

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.000 
flag at the same
time<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> at<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.720> same<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.830> just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
time so at the same time just you just

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.820 
time so at the same time just you just
run<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.790> second<00:02:18.180> before<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:19.320> it

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
run on it just a second before so it

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.530 
run on it just a second before so it
just<00:02:20.100> says<00:02:20.220> you'll<00:02:20.430> capture<00:02:20.640> an<00:02:20.910> app<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.420> it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
just says you'll capture an app that it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
just says you'll capture an app that it
stops<00:02:22.110> moving<00:02:22.290> because<00:02:22.650> obviously<00:02:22.950> he's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
stops moving because obviously he's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.680 
stops moving because obviously he's
preventing<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.910> from<00:02:23.940> actually<00:02:24.270> fully

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
preventing you from actually fully

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.970 
preventing you from actually fully
capturing<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> flag<00:02:25.380> okay<00:02:26.220> we'll<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.430> here

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
capturing the flag okay we'll see here

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.550 
capturing the flag okay we'll see here
wait<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.010> everything<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.460> bit<00:02:29.610> slow<00:02:30.560> yeah

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
wait for everything is a bit slow yeah

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.150 
wait for everything is a bit slow yeah
you<00:02:31.620> put<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.280> roof<00:02:34.010> went<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
you put it on this roof went to a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.730 
you put it on this roof went to a
potential<00:02:36.030> response<00:02:36.120> behind<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.320> you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
potential response behind there and you

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.530 
potential response behind there and you
can<00:02:37.860> either<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.340> behind<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.880> or<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.300> into

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
can either get it behind you or get into

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.970 
can either get it behind you or get into
the<00:02:39.630> side<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.350> done<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.800> side

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the side of you we done it to the side

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640 
the side of you we done it to the side
because<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.580> jump<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:43.140> sprint

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
because you have to jump and you sprint

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.770 
because you have to jump and you sprint
just<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.400> second<00:02:44.760> before<00:02:44.820> him<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.600> should

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
just a second before him and it should

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.690 
just a second before him and it should
look<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.530> expert<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:47.010> grabbing<00:02:47.400> flag

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
look like the expert is grabbing flag

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.040 
look like the expert is grabbing flag
but<00:02:47.970> you're<00:02:48.090> not<00:02:48.210> actually<00:02:48.330> fully<00:02:48.630> grab<00:02:48.930> on

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
but you're not actually fully grab on

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.660 
but you're not actually fully grab on
that<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.800> then<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.040> place<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.430> into<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
that and then you place it into the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that and then you place it into the
bottom<00:02:50.970> left<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:52.160> hey<00:02:53.160> presto<00:02:53.390> you're<00:02:54.390> up

packages as it's dropping the care

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.500 
packages as it's dropping the care
packages<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.550> going<00:02:59.820> down<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.000> drop<00:03:00.360> them

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
packages like going down to drop them
