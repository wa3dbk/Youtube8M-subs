00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
I figured we'd be using it all really
quickly<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> twisted<00:00:42.000> my

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
quickly so I just kind of twisted my

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.740 
quickly so I just kind of twisted my
hair<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.680> kind<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> set<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.539> again<00:00:45.539> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
hair up kind of set it down again just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.940 
hair up kind of set it down again just
kind<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.989> rolling<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> around

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
kind of rolling it around

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.290 
kind of rolling it around
I<00:00:48.079> didn't<00:00:49.079> part<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.530> perfect<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I didn't part it perfect so just a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
I didn't part it perfect so just a
little<00:00:51.539> bit<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.899> my<00:00:52.020> finger<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.270> see

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little bit on my finger and I just see

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit on my finger and I just see
it's<00:00:54.480> melting<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.649> really<00:00:56.100> believe<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's melting and I really believe that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.090 
it's melting and I really believe that
that<00:00:56.579> cocoa<00:00:57.000> butter<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.660> what's<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that cocoa butter is what's going to be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.790 
that cocoa butter is what's going to be
able<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> hold<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> style<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> little

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
able to hold the style for a little

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.270 
able to hold the style for a little
while

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
while

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
now while I was doing it I actually kept

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.649 
now while I was doing it I actually kept
a<00:01:04.019> plastic<00:01:04.409> bag<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.799> hair<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.479> these<00:01:06.479> don't
