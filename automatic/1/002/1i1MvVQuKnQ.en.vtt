 he's going to be chef de cuisine at codis 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.070
 vintage paris 9th so today we 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 wants to make a dish with asparagus 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.309
 rock and high from our friend sylvain 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.359
 the a26 more than we started 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.260
 peel a little bit what it is 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.780
 big green asparagus 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.330
 so we're not just the end for 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.230
 remove a little bitterness 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.410
 so we're going to do that with a foie gras 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.119
 hot a radish juice from alcon a juice from 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.449
 Black radish pardon with a broth of 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.029
 hen 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 so we're going to run the asparagus 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.300
 six minutes 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 it's the responsibility of another is very 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.760
 salty 7 grams per liter to avoid 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.540
 the rousselle and behind so after we 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.070
 will cut the escalope of foie gras that's 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.879
 a foie gras from the gers of the farm of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.340
 challans that I buy that I buy in 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.980
 director so we'll make a stopover at 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.290
 about 100 g so we will remove the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.739
 water asparagus we will put it in 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.739
 a plastic box 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
 with a little bit of radish oil 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.450
 continue telling them I'm seduced 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.240
 the book said and lemongrass for 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.240
 bring a little bit of lemon words 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 and here we go smoke 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.770
 so we're going to smoke so that smokes adds a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 lemon 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.910
 a little bit of beech wood 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.500
 then I search the more have to 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.780
 take out a little bit the end of the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.570
 sptr ge with lemon thyme it gives a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 little bit a little bit of wood 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 who with the hot foie gras gets married 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.520
 very very well actually so we 're going to them 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 leave six minutes 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.850
 so here we will prepare the little juice of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 radish so I switched to the juicer 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 a radish white radish black pardon so I 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.979
 put in my work with a light bulb 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.590
 lemongrass so I always stop the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.259
 Lemongrass with chicken broth 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.400
 because it brings back a little side 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.800
 always look for the little side quote 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 that I love in the kitchen I'm going 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.380
 I have a knob of butter just for 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.930
 lather the right to make 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.160
 to foam the broth actually and there I 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.030
 will make it run the three minutes 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 so the hot foie gras unlike 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.680
 what we can think of as playing 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.880
 often in the reports anything that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.280
 either but I start it in a 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.770
 very very hot frying pan game flour 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.770
 slightly and I always finish in the oven 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380
 for actually I did not cost myself 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.840
 crispy with flour game that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.840
 prevents me from losing a lot of material and 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.260
 and I'm baking just to do it 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.159
 take the heat well smoking hairs 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.480
 I put the foie gras of the year so 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.480
 slightly floured as I explained 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.080
 So therefore the salt pepper that of 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.800
 ireland 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.819
 normally I use a lot of those 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.060
 requested but then I could in 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.060
 moment 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.840
 this is where we should score and we will 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.269
 finish it in the oven 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.269
 there we will leave him two minutes and 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.019
 after letting it rest on the 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.849
 stove for really that heat gets 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.290
 diffuse inside for it to be 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.239
 just the rosÃ© so here we go out 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.620
 smoked asparagus so there they are well 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.620
 smoked so six minutes 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.349
 how far do we go 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.290
 so the ear we will put it aside 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.510
 since for now I have not 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.260
 need so we 'll go to dressage 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.260
 month but the three asparagus 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.659
 which are beautiful by the way 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.140
 we 'll put some of his wishes is 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.459
 so that's the first beans 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.720
 normally there is rather on June 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.750
 but the season fly starts more and 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.760
 earlier this is the small the little 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.760
 bean that is very crunchy 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.920
 we go 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.080
 m escalope of foie gras that beats 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.080
 retirement 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.990
 we'll put a little oil a little 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.990
 oil in the hollow are 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.770
 a little shoots of alcon radish 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.050
 he has a little bitterness 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.099
 mistake we will take the broth that 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.199
 I did so that I made based 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.039
 so brady chicken broth 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.039
 citronella 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.580
 and there we go the verse slightly on the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.580
 side 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.410
 so why is the marriage radish and will 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.470
 because drilling finds it's 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.690
 work slightly like that it's me 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.930
 the slightly sweet is not going to 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.160
 say sweet but the texture with their has 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.300
 said they have already stinging Sade 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.730
 really an explosion in the mouth 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.780
 the smudging smoke why it softens in 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.940
 make the appearance with thyme smoking 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.620
 lemon and with the marriage of the spiciness of 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.730
 rally and foie gras that stays for months 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.930
 it shows a product 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.910
 extraordinary that I find 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.010
 extraordinary and he and there you believe him 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.440
 are if I'm here it's a fine sequel 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.100
 low-based fish gets the 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.100
 rights right here
