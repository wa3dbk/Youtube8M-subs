being sued over the surface and the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.670 
being sued over the surface and the
reason<00:02:41.480> why<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.660> because<00:02:41.810> according<00:02:42.530> to

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
reason why is because according to

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.560

travel was not selling well and did not

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.180 
travel was not selling well and did not
let<00:02:47.270> investors<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:48.080> about<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.620> overstock

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
until three months later and obviously

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.800 
until three months later and obviously
there<00:02:52.190> are<00:02:52.220> lots<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.820> losses<00:02:53.240> right<00:02:53.390> there<00:02:53.690> and

there are lots of losses right there and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.360 
there are lots of losses right there and
investors<00:02:54.290> feel<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.680> they<00:02:54.770> were<00:02:54.830> cheated<00:02:55.280> on

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
investors feel that they were cheated on

with this whole surface project as the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.440 
with this whole surface project as the
company<00:02:57.740> probably<00:02:58.220> overlooked<00:02:58.880> how<00:02:59.210> well

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
company probably overlooked how well

question of the day what do you think
that<00:03:06.560> Microsoft<00:03:07.130> should<00:03:07.340> do<00:03:07.520> with<00:03:07.640> all<00:03:07.850> these

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
that Microsoft should do with all these

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.610 
that Microsoft should do with all these
tablets<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.900> they<00:03:09.050> have<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.500> an

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
tablets that they have there an

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.900 
tablets that they have there an
overstock<00:03:10.100> what<00:03:10.340> do<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.430> think<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.790> they

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
overstock what do you think that they

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.490 
overstock what do you think that they
should<00:03:10.940> do<00:03:11.270> with<00:03:11.450> them<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.960> my<00:03:12.350> particular

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
should do with them in my particular

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.620 
should do with them in my particular
case<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:13.250> mean<00:03:13.520> if<00:03:13.730> they're<00:03:13.910> having<00:03:14.210> trouble

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
case I mean if they're having trouble

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.480 
case I mean if they're having trouble
with<00:03:14.840> people<00:03:15.200> liking<00:03:15.770> when<00:03:15.920> those<00:03:16.100> are<00:03:16.250> to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
with people liking when those are to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.360 
with people liking when those are to
your<00:03:16.580> liking<00:03:16.850> Windows<00:03:17.690> 8<00:03:17.930> why<00:03:18.590> not<00:03:18.800> sell<00:03:19.190> those

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
your liking Windows 8 why not sell those

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.580 
your liking Windows 8 why not sell those
things<00:03:19.700> at<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.880> hundred<00:03:20.180> bucks<00:03:20.330> apiece<00:03:20.540> get<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
things at a hundred bucks apiece get the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.470 
things at a hundred bucks apiece get the
platform<00:03:22.160> out<00:03:22.370> there<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.820> get<00:03:22.970> people<00:03:23.300> to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
platform out there and get people to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.479 
platform out there and get people to
like<00:03:23.720> them<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.440> developers<00:03:24.650> could<00:03:25.190> jump

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
like them so that developers could jump

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.699 
like them so that developers could jump
on<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.820> wagon<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.330> build<00:03:26.720> more<00:03:27.020> applications

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
on the wagon and build more applications

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.550 
on the wagon and build more applications
for<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> surface<00:03:28.250> RT<00:03:28.660> particularly<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.840> think

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
for the surface RT particularly I think

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
for the surface RT particularly I think
that's<00:03:30.709> probably<00:03:30.980> one<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> best

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
that's probably one of the best

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.949 
that's probably one of the best
solutions<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.120> mean<00:03:32.300> you're<00:03:32.450> losing<00:03:32.810> money

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
solutions I mean you're losing money

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.050 
solutions I mean you're losing money
anyways<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> overstock<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.430> mean<00:03:34.610> why<00:03:34.880> not

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
anyways but the overstock I mean why not

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.940 
anyways but the overstock I mean why not
just<00:03:35.120> make<00:03:35.480> money<00:03:35.720> somehow<00:03:35.930> at<00:03:36.410> least<00:03:36.800> not

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
just make money somehow at least not

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.350 
just make money somehow at least not
necessarily<00:03:37.430> from<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.640> tablets<00:03:38.060> leave<00:03:38.209> us<00:03:38.330> a

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
necessarily from the tablets leave us a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.729 
necessarily from the tablets leave us a
