00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
of doing it and that's with one of these

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.070 
of doing it and that's with one of these
traps<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.300> traps<00:02:15.600> work<00:02:15.810> quite<00:02:16.050> well

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
traps and these traps work quite well

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.230 
traps and these traps work quite well
all<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.280> tend<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.640> do

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
all they tend to do

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.860 
all they tend to do
is<00:02:18.390> trap<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.800> mouse<00:02:20.010> or<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.400> rodent<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.090> rap

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
is trap the mouse or the rodent the rap

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.140

whatever<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.710> they<00:02:23.220> trap<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.790> there<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
whatever it is they trap it in there and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.570 
whatever it is they trap it in there and
then<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.380> take<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.740> away<00:02:25.950> somewhere

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
then you can take this away somewhere

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.970 
then you can take this away somewhere
and<00:02:26.820> release<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.360> into<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.600> wild<00:02:28.050> hopefully

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and release it into the wild hopefully

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.190 
and release it into the wild hopefully

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
again you trap it you bait the trap with

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.950 
again you trap it you bait the trap with
peanut<00:02:37.950> butter<00:02:37.980> cheese<00:02:38.640> whatever<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.390> then
