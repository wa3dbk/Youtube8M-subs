00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.140 
so now how does this car drive agile
seein<00:01:47.110> as<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.650> go<00:01:47.830> through<00:01:47.860> this<00:01:48.159> term<00:01:48.460> has<00:01:49.090> a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
seein as I go through this term has a

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.149 
seein as I go through this term has a
lot<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.659> understeer<00:01:50.170> more<00:01:50.470> than<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.740> would<00:01:51.130> have

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
lot of understeer more than I would have

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.130 
lot of understeer more than I would have
thought<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.550> would<00:01:51.670> have<00:01:51.880> I've<00:01:52.780> heard<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.110> lot

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
thought it would have I've heard a lot

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.050 
thought it would have I've heard a lot
of<00:01:53.290> good<00:01:53.410> things<00:01:53.680> about<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.400> car<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.880> weighs

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
of good things about this car it weighs

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.040 
of good things about this car it weighs
less<00:01:55.300> than<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.720> GTI<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.710> civic<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.780> should

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
less than a GTI on the civic so should

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.540 
less than a GTI on the civic so should
have<00:01:59.229> more<00:01:59.470> power<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.800> weight<00:01:59.920> ratio<00:01:59.979> should

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
have more power to weight ratio should

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.060 
have more power to weight ratio should
handle<00:02:00.880> better<00:02:01.060> but<00:02:01.360> from<00:02:02.080> my<00:02:02.290> initial<00:02:02.590> views

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
handle better but from my initial views

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.680 
handle better but from my initial views
I<00:02:04.200> felt<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.470> handle<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.920> little<00:02:06.190> bit<00:02:06.310> worse

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
I felt this handle a little bit worse

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.900 
I felt this handle a little bit worse
than<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.319> GTI<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.250> lot<00:02:09.429> worse<00:02:09.580> than<00:02:09.789> that

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
than the GTI and a lot worse than that

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.060 
than the GTI and a lot worse than that
we<00:02:10.060> need<00:02:10.239> but<00:02:10.989> then<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.290> other<00:02:11.440> side<00:02:11.800> this
