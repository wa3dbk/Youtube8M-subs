okay<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.109> thought<00:00:07.319> we'd<00:00:07.440> do<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> walk-around

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
okay so I thought we'd do a walk-around

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.839 
okay so I thought we'd do a walk-around

work<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:20.430> time<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> bought<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.630> were

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
work the time I bought this there were

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.750 
work the time I bought this there were
only<00:00:21.900> two<00:00:22.710> others<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.250> knew<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> in

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
only two others that I knew of in

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
only two others that I knew of in
Scotland<00:00:24.500> one<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> newer<00:00:25.920> model<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:27.050> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
Scotland one was a newer model and the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
Scotland one was a newer model and the
second<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.490> process<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.000> being

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
second one was in the process of being

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.840 
second one was in the process of being
restored<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.949> think<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> second<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.759> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
restored I think that the second one is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.229 
restored I think that the second one is
just<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.239> finished<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.850> work<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
focus in on that for you here so you can
