00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of the 5200 u series but of course there

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.640 
of the 5200 u series but of course there
will<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:29.939> different<00:00:30.750> processors<00:00:31.470> available

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
will be different processors available

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
will be different processors available
that's<00:00:32.520> only<00:00:32.759> 13<00:00:33.210> point<00:00:33.510> four<00:00:33.750> millimeters

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that's only 13 point four millimeters

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
that's only 13 point four millimeters
thick<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.070> width<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:35.820> means<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
thick which is width which means that is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
thick which is width which means that is
really<00:00:36.540> quite<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.079> slim<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.010> said<00:00:38.070> really

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really quite a slim and as I said really

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
really quite a slim and as I said really
amazingly<00:00:39.000> light<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.480> 14<00:00:39.840> inch<00:00:39.960> noble<00:00:40.200> but

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
amazingly light for 14 inch noble but

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.790 
amazingly light for 14 inch noble but
still<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.040> 10<00:00:41.430> hour<00:00:41.670> battery<00:00:41.820> life<00:00:42.800> maximum

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
still has a 10 hour battery life maximum

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.380 
still has a 10 hour battery life maximum
which<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> also<00:00:44.250> again<00:00:44.670> quite<00:00:44.910> good<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.239> with

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
which is also again quite good so with

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
which is also again quite good so with
Wi-Fi<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.780> should<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:47.129> 6<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> 8<00:00:47.640> hours

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
Wi-Fi you should get there 6 to 8 hours

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
Wi-Fi you should get there 6 to 8 hours
I<00:00:48.120> guess<00:00:48.329> easily<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I guess easily I don't want to see the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
I guess easily I don't want to see the
bezel<00:00:50.399> around<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.910> screen<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.270> seven

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bezel around the screen is just seven

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.000 
bezel around the screen is just seven
point<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:51.960> millimeters<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.649> guys<00:00:52.800> can

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
point two millimeters so you guys can

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
point two millimeters so you guys can
see<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> also<00:00:54.090> an<00:00:54.329> FM<00:00:54.570> almost<00:00:55.199> an

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
see that it's and also an FM almost an

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.930 
see that it's and also an FM almost an
