Snow<00:01:03.359> White<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> admit<00:01:04.589> simply

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
Snow White I have to admit simply

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.200 
Snow White I have to admit simply
because<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.420> men<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.830> much

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
because the men just don't have as much

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
because the men just don't have as much
variety<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.799> guess<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.150> Disney

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
variety in them I guess in the Disney

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.149 
variety in them I guess in the Disney
World<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.080> suppose<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> look
