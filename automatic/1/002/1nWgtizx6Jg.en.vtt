00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
rails I make these rails myself I bought

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.380 
rails I make these rails myself I bought
a<00:00:18.450> special<00:00:18.750> machine<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.590> these<00:00:19.860> and

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
a special machine to make these and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.749 
a special machine to make these and
they're<00:00:21.390> lighter<00:00:21.720> than<00:00:22.560> these<00:00:22.919> rails<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
they're lighter than these rails that

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.600 
they're lighter than these rails that
are<00:00:23.790> made<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.329> angle<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.079> flat<00:00:25.349> stock<00:00:25.710> so

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610

it around most of these guys have built

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.900 
it around most of these guys have built
cages<00:01:46.620> they<00:01:46.770> weld<00:01:47.010> everything<00:01:47.160> on<00:01:47.550> there

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
cages they weld everything on there

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.300 
cages they weld everything on there
these<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.260> taken<00:01:49.440> off<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:50.010> have<00:01:50.190> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
these can be taken off just have to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.580 
these can be taken off just have to
loosen<00:01:50.820> these<00:01:51.060> two<00:01:51.120> screws<00:01:51.690> take<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.230> screw

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
loosen these two screws take that screw

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
loosen these two screws take that screw
off<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> drop<00:01:53.370> rod<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.510> take<00:01:54.660> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
off on the drop rod and you can take the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.980 
off on the drop rod and you can take the
pan<00:01:55.050> off<00:01:55.080> put<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.620> different<00:01:55.800> pan<00:01:56.220> on<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.990> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
pan off put a different pan on and so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.380 
pan off put a different pan on and so
it's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.440> bit<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:58.710> versatile

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
it's a little bit more versatile

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.790 
it's a little bit more versatile
everybody<00:02:00.390> likes<00:02:00.690> cages<00:02:01.200> built<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.590> little

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
everybody likes cages built a little

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.960 
everybody likes cages built a little
different<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.580> that's<00:02:03.360> why<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.730> can't

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
different so that's why I can I can't

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.820 
different so that's why I can I can't
build<00:02:06.210> them<00:02:06.360> every<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.620> pick

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
build them every way I have to pick

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.750 
build them every way I have to pick
something<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.929> longer<00:02:10.289> pan<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:12.239> makes<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
something so this longer pan it makes it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.580 
something so this longer pan it makes it
look<00:02:14.420> gives<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.900> put<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> little<00:02:15.410> bit<00:02:15.530> more

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
look gives you put a little bit more

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.850 
look gives you put a little bit more
kill<00:02:16.010> area<00:02:16.430> here<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.970> moved<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:17.959> an<00:02:18.200> inch<00:02:18.680> and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
kill area here I moved it up an inch and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.410 
kill area here I moved it up an inch and
a<00:02:18.920> half<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:19.430> what<00:02:19.610> these<00:02:19.730> squares<00:02:20.060> are<00:02:20.300> I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
a half that's what these squares are I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.080 
a half that's what these squares are I
moved<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:20.959> an<00:02:21.080> inch<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.379> a<00:02:21.410> half<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.790> is

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
moved it up an inch and a half but it is

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.140 
moved it up an inch and a half but it is
four<00:02:24.080> inches<00:02:24.349> longer<00:02:24.800> than<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> older<00:02:25.879> pan

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
four inches longer than the older pan

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.830 
four inches longer than the older pan
and<00:02:26.569> these<00:02:27.379> new<00:02:27.620> rails<00:02:27.950> are<00:02:28.400> very<00:02:28.580> light<00:02:28.879> if

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and these new rails are very light if

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.449 
and these new rails are very light if
you<00:02:30.050> can<00:02:30.230> look<00:02:30.349> at<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> edge<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.980> these<00:02:31.130> rails

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
you can look at the edge of these rails

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.170 
you can look at the edge of these rails
the<00:02:32.360> leg<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.959> front<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.500> longer<00:02:34.040> than<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the leg on the front is longer than the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.530 
the leg on the front is longer than the
leg<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.720> back<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.860> that's<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.540> this

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
leg in the back and that's so this

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.789 
leg in the back and that's so this
horizontal<00:02:39.140> rod<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:41.000> hit<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.420> leg<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.590> rod

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
horizontal rod can hit that leg the rod

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.830 
horizontal rod can hit that leg the rod
won't<00:02:43.129> go<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:43.640> all<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.970> way<00:02:44.000> out<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.720> other

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
won't go or all the way out so in other

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.170 
won't go or all the way out so in other
words<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.290> can't<00:02:45.560> get<00:02:45.799> that<00:02:46.010> trap<00:02:46.610> set<00:02:47.000> where

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
words you can't get that trap set where

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.050 
words you can't get that trap set where
the<00:02:47.299> rod<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.660> too<00:02:47.840> far<00:02:48.110> out<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.739> when<00:02:49.549> if<00:02:49.880> an

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the rod is too far out and when if an

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.569 
the rod is too far out and when if an
animal<00:02:50.390> pulls<00:02:50.630> up<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.019> pan<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.980> rod<00:02:52.250> will

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
animal pulls up on a pan the rod will

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.360 
animal pulls up on a pan the rod will
stop<00:02:52.910> when<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.390> hits<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:54.319> backside<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:54.980> that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
stop when it hits the backside of that

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
stop when it hits the backside of that
rail<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:57.380> that's<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.950> reason<00:02:58.130> for<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.549> and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
rail so that's the reason for that and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.270 
rail so that's the reason for that and
this<00:02:59.540> seems<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.930> be<00:03:00.049> working<00:03:00.410> pretty<00:03:01.040> good

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
this seems to be working pretty good

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.720 
this seems to be working pretty good
right<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.739> we're<00:03:03.739> just<00:03:03.769> not<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.519> build

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
right now so we're just not to build

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.260 
right now so we're just not to build
this<00:03:04.910> prototype<00:03:05.239> cage<00:03:05.900> now
