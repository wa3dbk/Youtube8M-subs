00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
hi welcome to the first lesson on the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.710 
hi welcome to the first lesson on the
pentatonic<00:00:19.160> scale<00:00:19.490> there<00:00:20.270> are<00:00:20.390> five

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
pentatonic scale there are five

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.529 
pentatonic scale there are five
pentatonic<00:00:21.560> patterns<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.250> they<00:00:22.699> all<00:00:22.910> connect

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
pentatonic patterns and they all connect

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.710 
pentatonic patterns and they all connect
to<00:00:24.140> cover<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.619> entire<00:00:24.710> neck<00:00:25.220> of<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.430> guitar

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
to cover the entire neck of the guitar

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.700 
to cover the entire neck of the guitar
so<00:00:27.130> let's<00:00:28.130> start<00:00:28.430> with<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.940> first<00:00:29.150> pattern

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
so let's start with the first pattern

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.149 
so let's start with the first pattern
it's<00:00:30.710> it's<00:00:31.130> it's<00:00:31.820> like<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.270> key<00:00:32.629> pattern<00:00:33.170> for

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:34.159 
it's it's it's like the key pattern for

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.829 
it's it's it's like the key pattern for
guitar<00:00:34.640> players<00:00:34.670> if<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.149> only<00:00:35.269> learn<00:00:35.420> one

guitar players if you only learn one

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.559 
guitar players if you only learn one
scale<00:00:36.319> this<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.339> the<00:00:37.519> scale<00:00:37.819> and<00:00:38.149> I'm<00:00:38.390> not

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and five eight also let's talk a little

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.710 
and five eight also let's talk a little
bit<00:02:12.930> about<00:02:12.960> what<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> pentatonic<00:02:14.160> scale<00:02:14.490> is

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
bit about what the pentatonic scale is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
bit about what the pentatonic scale is
pentatonic<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> five<00:02:16.320> note<00:02:16.560> scale<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
pentatonic is a five note scale here the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.980 
pentatonic is a five note scale here the
five<00:02:18.360> notes<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.240> then<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:21.959> just

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
five notes and then just they just

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.770 
five notes and then just they just
repeat<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:25.170> your<00:02:25.320> pentatonic<00:02:25.920> scale<00:02:26.780> here

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
repeat that's your pentatonic scale here

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.010 
repeat that's your pentatonic scale here
it<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.290> string<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.820> it's<00:02:33.660> actually

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
it is on one string and it's actually

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.180 
it is on one string and it's actually
really<00:02:34.380> good<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.740> get<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> know<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.080> interval

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
really good to get to know the interval

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
really good to get to know the interval
names<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.550> each<00:02:38.790> note<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:40.080> rock<00:02:40.290> Prodigy<00:02:40.800> we

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
names of each note in rock Prodigy we

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.920 
names of each note in rock Prodigy we
have<00:02:41.010> some<00:02:41.280> lessons<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:42.000> intervals<00:02:42.450> which

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
have some lessons on intervals which

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.840 
have some lessons on intervals which
will<00:02:43.140> clear<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> maybe<00:02:44.610> we'll<00:02:44.760> get

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
will clear that up and maybe we'll get

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.820 
will clear that up and maybe we'll get
to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.270> video<00:02:45.540> eventually<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.410> well<00:02:46.620> on

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
to do in a video eventually as well on

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.580 
to do in a video eventually as well on
that<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.280> alright<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that but alright so here is the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.979 
that but alright so here is the
intervals<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.760> minor<00:02:50.970> pentatonic<00:02:51.209> scale

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
intervals in the minor pentatonic scale

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.530 
intervals in the minor pentatonic scale
it's<00:02:52.530> route<00:02:53.510> minor<00:02:54.510> third

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
it's route minor third

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.920 
it's route minor third
fourth
