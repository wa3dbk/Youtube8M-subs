00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
I'm going to do a review of this movie

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.440 
I'm going to do a review of this movie
and<00:00:16.059> I'm<00:00:16.780> kind<00:00:17.080> of<00:00:17.460> split<00:00:18.460> up<00:00:18.610> into<00:00:18.790> three

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
and I'm kind of split up into three

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.270 
and I'm kind of split up into three
different<00:00:19.480> parts<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.380> first<00:00:20.500> one<00:00:20.860> being<00:00:21.100> what

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
different parts the first one being what

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.520 
different parts the first one being what
I<00:00:21.310> think<00:00:21.580> of<00:00:21.700> a<00:00:21.760> movie<00:00:22.170> second<00:00:23.170> part<00:00:23.380> what

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
I think of a movie second part what

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.830 
I think of a movie second part what
being<00:00:24.280> what<00:00:24.430> I<00:00:24.460> think<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.910> remaster<00:00:25.539> and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
being what I think of a remaster and

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.779 
being what I think of a remaster and
then<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.170> third<00:00:26.350> part<00:00:26.619> it<00:00:26.920> will<00:00:27.100> be<00:00:27.160> what<00:00:27.760> I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
then the third part it will be what I

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.990 
then the third part it will be what I
think<00:00:28.090> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.410> new<00:00:29.740> English<00:00:30.100> dub<00:00:30.369> compared<00:00:30.880> to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
think of the new English dub compared to

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.049 
think of the new English dub compared to
the<00:00:31.119> old<00:00:31.300> one<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:32.339> this<00:00:33.339> is<00:00:33.399> a<00:00:33.519> movie<00:00:33.819> I've<00:00:33.940> been

this<00:00:59.499> movie<00:00:59.889> I<00:00:59.920> think<00:01:01.589> there's<00:01:02.589> only<00:01:02.709> a

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
this movie I think there's only a

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.120 
this movie I think there's only a
saddest<00:01:03.309> movies<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.699> think<00:01:03.879> I've<00:01:03.940> ever<00:01:04.149> seen

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
saddest movies I think I've ever seen

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.279 
saddest movies I think I've ever seen
which<00:01:06.130> isn't<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.430> bad<00:01:06.579> thing<00:01:06.640> just<00:01:07.509> got<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.810> be

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
which isn't a bad thing just got to be

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.179 
which isn't a bad thing just got to be
like<00:01:08.710> mentally<00:01:09.159> prepared<00:01:09.579> for<00:01:09.670> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
like mentally prepared for it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.850 
like mentally prepared for it
so<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.310> movie<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.880> about<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:14.799> two

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
so the movie is about these two

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.060 
so the movie is about these two
characters<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:16.090> boy<00:01:16.329> who<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.780> named<00:01:17.140> SATA<00:01:17.649> and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
characters the boy who is named SATA and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.340 
characters the boy who is named SATA and
his<00:01:18.189> little<00:01:18.369> sister<00:01:18.460> who<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.210> named<00:01:19.479> Setsuko

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
his little sister who is named Setsuko

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.069 
his little sister who is named Setsuko
which<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.250> have<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.729> keep<00:01:22.060> remembering<00:01:22.780> how<00:01:23.049> to

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
which I have to keep remembering how to

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.810 
which I have to keep remembering how to
pronounce<00:01:23.469> because<00:01:23.829> there's<00:01:24.219> a<00:01:24.310> character<00:01:24.789> in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
pronounce because there's a character in

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.179 
pronounce because there's a character in
Toriko<00:01:25.479> named<00:01:25.750> setsuna<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:29.049> it<00:01:29.500> follows<00:01:29.890> them

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
Toriko named setsuna but it follows them

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.359 
Toriko named setsuna but it follows them
and<00:01:32.399> basically<00:01:33.399> how<00:01:33.700> World<00:01:34.359> War<00:01:34.659> 2<00:01:35.039> just<00:01:36.039> made

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
and basically how World War 2 just made

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.709 
and basically how World War 2 just made
their<00:01:36.549> lives<00:01:36.759> completely<00:01:37.659> shitty<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.479> very

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
their lives completely shitty the very

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.029 
their lives completely shitty the very
first<00:01:41.020> theme<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.289> this<00:01:41.350> movie<00:01:41.500> is<00:01:41.740> actually

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
first theme of this movie is actually

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.810 
first theme of this movie is actually
the<00:01:42.159> main<00:01:42.340> character<00:01:42.850> SATA<00:01:43.420> dying<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.469> like<00:01:44.649> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the main character SATA dying in like a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.160 
the main character SATA dying in like a
train<00:01:45.820> station<00:01:46.299> or<00:01:46.390> something<00:01:46.780> they<00:01:47.079> don't

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
train station or something they don't

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.749 
train station or something they don't
guess<00:01:47.859> I'm<00:01:47.979> pretty<00:01:48.130> sure<00:01:48.340> it's<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.549> train

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
guess I'm pretty sure it's a train

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.489 
guess I'm pretty sure it's a train
station<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.890> then<00:01:51.549> it's<00:01:51.729> sort<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.350> whole

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
station and then it's sort of the whole

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.319 
station and then it's sort of the whole
movie<00:01:53.770> some<00:01:53.979> more<00:01:54.159> or<00:01:54.249> less<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> flashback<00:01:55.090> then

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.570 
so the first thing that happens during
the<00:02:10.060> flashback<00:02:10.360> then<00:02:10.930> is<00:02:11.340> their<00:02:12.340> house

the flashback then is their house

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.770 
the flashback then is their house
getting<00:02:12.940> burned<00:02:13.300> down

words<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:28.630> know<00:02:28.750> she<00:02:28.870> she<00:02:29.860> calls<00:02:30.100> them

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
words for it you know she she calls them

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.230 
words for it you know she she calls them
pests<00:02:30.880> because<00:02:31.330> say<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.730> know<00:02:33.820> he's<00:02:33.970> busy

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
pests because say to you know he's busy

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.760 
pests because say to you know he's busy
taking<00:02:34.420> care<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.750> his<00:02:34.870> little<00:02:35.110> sister<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.680> he

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
taking care of his little sister so he

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.280 
taking care of his little sister so he
doesn't<00:02:36.010> want<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.220> go<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.940> school<00:02:37.930> or<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
doesn't want to go to school or get a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.930 
doesn't want to go to school or get a
job<00:02:38.380> or<00:02:38.740> anything<00:02:40.500> which<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.830> mean<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.370> can

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
job or anything which I mean I can

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.720 
job or anything which I mean I can
understand<00:02:43.510> her<00:02:44.459> being<00:02:45.459> annoyed<00:02:45.910> by<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.650> but

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
understand her being annoyed by that but

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.520 
understand her being annoyed by that but
um<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.510> fact<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.780> she<00:02:49.930> just<00:02:49.959> treats<00:02:50.410> them

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
um the fact that she just treats them

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.990 
um the fact that she just treats them
like<00:02:50.560> garbage<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.160> completely<00:02:51.550> uncalled<00:02:51.910> for

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
like garbage is completely uncalled for

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.370 
like garbage is completely uncalled for
I<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:55.270> eventually<00:02:56.910> SATA<00:02:57.910> gets<00:02:58.570> fed<00:02:59.350> up

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
I think so eventually SATA gets fed up

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.030 
I think so eventually SATA gets fed up
with<00:02:59.530> living<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.820> he<00:03:00.880> decides<00:03:01.209> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
with living like that and he decides to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.000 
with living like that and he decides to
basically<00:03:03.040> go<00:03:03.280> with<00:03:03.660> outside<00:03:04.660> with<00:03:05.530> his

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
basically go with outside with his

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.430 
basically go with outside with his
sister<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:09.900> eventually<00:03:10.900> throughout<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
sister and eventually throughout the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.510 
sister and eventually throughout the
course<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.770> that<00:03:11.890> they<00:03:12.070> both<00:03:12.220> die<00:03:13.260> which<00:03:14.520> it's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
course of that they both die which it's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.070 
course of that they both die which it's
not<00:03:15.580> really<00:03:15.820> much<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.120> spoiler<00:03:16.390> since<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
not really much of a spoiler since the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.600 
not really much of a spoiler since the
movie<00:03:17.320> starts<00:03:17.680> off<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.130> see<00:03:18.280> them<00:03:18.430> both

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
movie starts off and you see them both

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.280 
movie starts off and you see them both
as<00:03:18.790> ghosts

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
as ghosts

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.590 
as ghosts
but<00:03:21.130> I'm<00:03:21.220> not<00:03:21.370> going<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.580> go<00:03:21.730> into<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> details

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
but I'm not going to go into the details

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.080 
but I'm not going to go into the details
of<00:03:22.810> how<00:03:22.989> all<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.950> stuff<00:03:24.190> happens<00:03:24.610> exactly<00:03:27.090> so

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
of how all that stuff happens exactly so

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.810 
of how all that stuff happens exactly so
as<00:03:28.420> far<00:03:28.600> as<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.959> remaster<00:03:29.590> goes<00:03:29.769> this<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.160> like

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
as far as the remaster goes this is like

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.420 
as far as the remaster goes this is like
honestly<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:32.019> best<00:03:32.200> remaster<00:03:32.830> I've<00:03:32.980> ever

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
honestly the best remaster I've ever

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.940 
honestly the best remaster I've ever
seen

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
seen

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.430 
seen
you<00:03:35.950> know<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.420> really<00:03:37.420> liked<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.930> hakusho

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
you know I really liked the you hakusho

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.350 
you know I really liked the you hakusho
blu-rays<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:39.130> thought<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> dragon<00:03:39.820> boxes<00:03:40.239> were

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
blu-rays I thought the dragon boxes were

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.910 
blu-rays I thought the dragon boxes were
awesome<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:44.110> just<00:03:45.090> far<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.239> beyond

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
awesome but this is just far and beyond

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.000 
awesome but this is just far and beyond
better<00:03:47.920> than<00:03:48.280> both<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.489> those<00:03:48.730> remasters<00:03:49.450> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
better than both of those remasters I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.670 
better than both of those remasters I
honestly<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.900> think<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:52.989> could<00:03:53.200> fool<00:03:53.380> someone

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
honestly I think you could fool someone

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.440 
honestly I think you could fool someone
into<00:03:54.160> thinking<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.790> movie<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.150> made

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
into thinking that this movie was made

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.280 
into thinking that this movie was made
into<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:56.410> early<00:03:56.970> 2000s<00:03:57.970> probably<00:03:58.630> despite

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
into like early 2000s probably despite

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.400 
into like early 2000s probably despite
it<00:03:59.410> being<00:03:59.440> from<00:03:59.769> 1988<00:04:03.390> just<00:04:04.390> an<00:04:04.720> amazing<00:04:05.200> job

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
it being from 1988 just an amazing job

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.770 
it being from 1988 just an amazing job
that<00:04:06.010> they<00:04:06.280> did<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:07.239> think<00:04:07.420> there's<00:04:07.540> nobody

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
that they did and I think there's nobody

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
that they did and I think there's nobody
deserves<00:04:08.190> having<00:04:09.190> such<00:04:09.489> an<00:04:09.820> awesome<00:04:10.480> remaster

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
deserves having such an awesome remaster

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.520 
deserves having such an awesome remaster
and<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.920> mean<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.510> was<00:04:16.720> done<00:04:16.959> by<00:04:17.079> Studio<00:04:17.470> Ghibli

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
and I mean it was done by Studio Ghibli

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.430 
and I mean it was done by Studio Ghibli
so<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.280> animation<00:04:18.640> already<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:20.169> looks

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
so the animation already just looks

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.710 
so the animation already just looks
great<00:04:20.789> there's<00:04:21.789> just<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> bunch<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.300> digital

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
great there's just a bunch of digital

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.820 
great there's just a bunch of digital
noise<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.260> they<00:04:23.349> have<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.560> clean<00:04:23.890> up<00:04:24.039> really

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
noise that they have to clean up really

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.300 
noise that they have to clean up really
so<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.670> have<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.360> original<00:04:27.770> DVD<00:04:28.770> version

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
so if you have the original DVD version

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.560 
so if you have the original DVD version
of<00:04:29.430> this<00:04:29.640> or<00:04:30.350> VHS<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.650> would<00:04:32.250> suggest<00:04:32.570> getting

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.190 
to the original release I'm sure
especially<00:04:41.060> with<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.180> fact<00:04:42.420> that<00:04:42.540> cent<00:04:43.080> I

of<00:04:45.630> surprised<00:04:46.020> me<00:04:46.790> but<00:04:47.790> um<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.630> think<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.770> they

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
of surprised me but um I think that they

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.290 
of surprised me but um I think that they
did<00:04:50.190> an<00:04:50.280> awesome<00:04:50.460> job<00:04:50.700> with<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.300> dub<00:04:51.510> honestly

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
did an awesome job with the dub honestly

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.540 
did an awesome job with the dub honestly
if<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.450> watch<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.840> original<00:04:55.050> dub<00:04:55.890> you'll

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
if you watch the original dub you'll

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.100 
if you watch the original dub you'll
notice<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.000> lot<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.210> times<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.900> mouth

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
notice that a lot of times the mouth

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.690 
notice that a lot of times the mouth
movements<00:04:58.650> won't<00:04:58.860> match<00:04:59.220> up<00:04:59.250> with<00:04:59.550> the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
movements won't match up with the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.030 
movements won't match up with the
dialogue<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.970> sometimes<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:04.290> way<00:05:04.530> they<00:05:04.560> say

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
dialogue and sometimes the way they say

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.010 
dialogue and sometimes the way they say
things<00:05:05.070> are<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.700> little<00:05:05.850> like<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.510> don't<00:05:06.810> know
