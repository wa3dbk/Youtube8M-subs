00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.770
 hello hello and welcome to all and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 at all on that when you had 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.020
 today a new video of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.029
 presentation on a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.460
 food is said that the whole 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.220
 new s12 i have a 80 power supply 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
 plus gold with a 5 year warranty that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 features a 120mm fan of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.969
 Japanese type capacitors and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 cables that are non- modular but of 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.530
 flat type we will discover this version 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 750 watts so right now 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 now it's sure that the tv code with 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 this food that will be offered to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.149
 a price around 120 euros it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.590
 you will be delivered a power cord 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.600
 a small pouch that includes the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 fasteners a sticker so sonic and at 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.629
 scratches and necklaces and finally 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.489
 a user manual 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.010
 let's now go around this ace 12 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.560
 g a rather simple power supply 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.110
 we have a steel casing integrally 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.030
 black covered with a black paint of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.710
 quality on the top we find a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.270
 grid nest design of bees is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.759
 directly in the shop in the carcass 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.490
 with a 120 mm ball fan 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.610
 bearing which is given for silencer 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.860
 we have a s2j marking here in white 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.329
 in the back we see it is also 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.330
 relatively classic with a grid 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.720
 lee type of bee a small device 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.360
 includes 20 brands if sonic entry 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.149
 for your power cord to 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.979
 the switch on the other side 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.539
 find the technical characteristics 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.420
 of food without which we 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.929
 let's come back back while in 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.360
 below we only have black on 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.880
 sees it to the cables are of type no 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.440
 modular we find again a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.149
 tagging s12 I here even at the level of 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.220
 cables we have a good length 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:11.519
 we have two types of cables cables is 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.620
 sheathed nylon for the 24 pin one tea xx 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.540
 and flat cables for the rest we 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.310
 let's go around his flat cables 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
 so we'll tell you right away 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.610
 every time it's always a little bit 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 complicated with the feeds we 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.079
 lead modular to show the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.420
 different to the cable that we have 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.780
 so we will find a cord that 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.930
 offers two pci express 6 + 8 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.930
 pine 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.630
 we will find at second cordon of 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.769
 this guy at we're trying to 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.319
 search 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.200
 here it is 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.480
 so we have to second cord or of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.859
 this type we can therefore drive several 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:03:04.159
 graphics cards in sli and crossfire 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:03:04.159
 we then have a cable 4 8 pin cpu 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:15.030
 we then find a cable that offers 4 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:19.650
 taking molex and a floppy plug we 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.079
 again have an 8-pin cpu socket have 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:27.739
 continued with a plug that offers two 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:30.930
 sata another with four sata sockets 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.099
 and finally new whims reached at 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.099
 level of connectivity so we are 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.889
 very well armed we can not fly 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.019
 bad hard drives and so to a celi or 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.799
 a crossfire of two big cards 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.790
 graphics 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.269
 at the level of characteristics 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.970
 techniques of this block here we are 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.680
 we come here we have 3 volts 3 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.799
 before we lose 1.5 volt guess we lose and 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.040
 a single 12-volt rail of 62-year-old father 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.819
 for 644 is safe this 12 volts 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.099
 of course the test will be found on 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.049
 cowcotland.com very soon 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.209
 you give back the price 120 euros the 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.310
 model and to be silent at the level 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.930
 tensions he should have should no 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.629
 there is no problem since we are on 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.979
 a basis if sonic and the rate is 120 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.259
 euros on according to you give an appointment 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.000
 call soon on tv for 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.380
 new videos of presentation and on 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.030
