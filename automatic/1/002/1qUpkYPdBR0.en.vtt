00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.090
 Hello, my name is Rodrigo. 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.940
 Felix 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.390
 I'm an instrumentalist, you can not 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.680
 observe 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.779
 in this lot are so in 2011 attended 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.619
 Some students' requests already have some 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.109
 of the saxophonist and asks how 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.820
 the type of 7 that uses the effects that 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:37.460
 I usually use that I am 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.829
 to improve the sound of the instrument is 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.409
 saxophone and help on stage is not like this 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.300
 first of all that is here is not 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:52.730
 nothing new right? 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.519
 musicians like mike black is blood 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.879
 used not with this simple 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.039
 parity is over is implemented effects 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.809
 on your saxophone instrument and 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.740
 other musicians there 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.410
 so this need started from me 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.420
 help is even with the rolling suitcase 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.250
 new sounds on stage and awakens in so 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.060
 interest between musicians and stadiums 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.119
 huh 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 so this is perfect first time 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.060
 What I use is a normal revival. 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 is the only one that uses is receives as with 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.510
 most repeated law delay 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:59.520
 van rompuy already the delay bit slower 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:59.520
 can i 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.910
 now if the mayor I use is a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.430
 octave I have here in the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.720
 fundamental and another called guilt 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.550
 eighth bass 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.970
 it's as if I created that can win 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:21.310
 actually a tenor sax helps me a lot 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.320
 is in following is occasions as the musician 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.260
 Touch the sun and I'll send more, will not you? 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.390
 the presence of metal trio I usually 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.870
 use this effect to deal with metal 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.330
 huh 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.090
 But then when I'm already with colleagues in the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.610
 trumpet bonnet the strip that effect goes 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.440
 to stay real online but not cure 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.410
 I usually use this feat here 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.410
 is the eighth of rock will work here the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.500
 it's done little more artificial than 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.700
 helps a lot in setting up the April voice 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.770
 below are not 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.630
 in this idea of ​​metaleira ok 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:16.860
 the mayor used a little more 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.860
 Exotic is not it's the fifth fifth fair 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.310
 the simplest sounds right 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.590
 the mayor I use is the eighth pain 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.190
 without the fundamental is not only with the eighth 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.190
 underneath 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.280
 another effect that usually uses the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.280
 fair doors 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.550
 these are more exotic is to refer a 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.040
 little southern unit of Asian countries 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.040
 how china japan at last 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:16.579
 Okay then and the imagination will work on 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:21.410
 another effect they usually use is the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.349
 where you put it with songs from the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:48.530
 of the 70's and 80's that use a lot 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:51.860
 if this effect has no effect 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.440
 special is that so life pretty dick 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:00.020
 that draws the attention of other musicians is 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.949
 the only album I do not use a pedal 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.860
 where it helps in opening the 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.990
 controller is actually where the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.300
 work more in the articulation of the 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.599
 touch pick and work more or less 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.599
 on here 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.640
 there is another effect that 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.340
 I like to use it up, it's very rare, huh? 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.770
 which is greater attention 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.770
 the staff and no more to harmonize ok 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:38.070
 dominoes can play around with right 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:44.620
 harmonizing to make a base of who 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:49.450
 so I use is the one wireless transmitter 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:55.630
 simple and with microphone is it 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:58.420
 black is is specific to the guitar 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.410
 even though it has no subject as far as I 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.020
 I do not know 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.270
 have no specific questions for 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.700
 practice saxophone where it goes on 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.650
 knowledge without brakes, right? 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.230
 the idea is that the show already has a 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.720
 infinity of specific pedals 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.630
 for you can also be used more 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.760
 for me so it's worth using 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.370
 to avoid hair infection created with the 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.770
 guitar that can be is to elaborate 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.970
 developed for sakineh so here a 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.070
 rp 50 digitech cheap simple way 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:34.150
 and which are also quite on stage not 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:38.140
 had enough creation there in the effects 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.700
 so it's ok there's the tip for who 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.020
 want to use this type of resource 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.840
 helps a lot 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.670
 Okay, so that's what knowledge is for. 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.670
 if it was worth the next
