00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:03.290
 chose the theme of fear 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.120
 to talk a little 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.830
 xy may be when the district had been perfect 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.360
 as few 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.429
 then proof of what I say is that you do not have to have growth 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.429
 and seeing it cataloged as an answer 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.960
 the maternal body a sheet a risk situation but that is 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 unknown 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.449
 Isabel GaudÃ­ 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.919
 he defines it as the result of a relationship 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.300
 thought time 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.480
 that is to say if this present moment and our value never passes then occupied 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.019
 only so you could be experiencing a free moment of 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.580
 smoke-free fears 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.060
 before several instances are counted the power will pass if what can happen 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.770
 if not 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.860
 by then 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.940
 there are district visions and work hard to be authentic to be in the moment 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.999
 I presented 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.529
 the worrying thing but involving the time without anything superstitious of 

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:59.170
 get to the hospital 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.900
 but I'm worried about what when the judge qualifier I'm living the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.690
 moment presentier orchestra dispar dollar 2 / 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.890
 although efforts from two approaches did not even come logical 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.200
 the point of view but logical 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.890
 if you have any of the body's bills before a threat and the point of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.530
 meteorological view is known as the activation of life if the look that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.780
 period we do not have the brain and that's what makes it work like alarm like 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.210
 sensor will buy 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.060
 the unemployment rate that we hear base situation of some assets for 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 activities for this decade 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.860
 and then called a series of signals to the body and his own hands 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 I do not know what will happen 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.450
 then at least one month 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.950
 it's cheaper if your blood pressure increase your metabolism change the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.060
 blood to the extremities in this subzero like the legs themselves 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.800
 sources 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.080
 weak frosts in general 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 another thing to have very important that in another two years experienced escort 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.550
 body pilot care more about surviving and the system this 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.110
 immune is deactivated let's say you're not worried about producing in the

 panorama adam albiol interests or tibi 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.960
 in the face of the threat 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.310
 in this case many fears and this is what I like to talk about n have to see more 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.979
 with 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:23.109
 colville the cities as too true for example 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.509
 and stories that are not like that not encore temple 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.789
 for themselves 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:35.839
 psychological anguish depression will go without audited data of fear 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:40.310
 these inhabitants are always there but we declared 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.589
 and this linked to the single currency other crimes 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:48.539
 here some that showed up as anxiety depression worry 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.589

 the identify it succumb civil lives that part are imitating 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.549
 but before that this thesis 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.549
 that you liked until today that at this moment 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.539
 the outdoor sources 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.749
 what good things 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.489
 if God did not exist as if the challenge happens is that the next day 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.850
 if they met at this event 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.850
 copies however many did not exist 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.239
 the series preceded him 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.309
 What is the worst that can happen

 in case it would be the establishment this Colombian this is what 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.779
 worse that can happen 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.779
 in that situation consume but that the control that has 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.539
 and finally 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.699
 we want signes 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.359
 let's overcome 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.319

 one of the cases 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.259
 stylistic 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.739
 what can I do to start controlling

 by fears about housing 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.569
 before the performance of messi 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.409
 in the unknown

 how could I and the security 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.719
