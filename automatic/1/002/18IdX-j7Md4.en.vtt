00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.430 
to know the pitch - is a good doing it
in<00:01:47.940> purple<00:01:48.330> this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> best<00:01:48.960> color<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
in purple this is the best color so

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.260 
in purple this is the best color so
they're<00:01:49.590> fresh<00:01:49.830> when<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.700> grinding<00:01:50.940> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
they're fresh when you're grinding it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.540 
they're fresh when you're grinding it
that's<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> color<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:52.170> need<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.710> nice<00:01:53.220> green

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
that's the color you need a nice green

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.840 
that's the color you need a nice green
color<00:01:53.580> what<00:01:54.539> is<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.990> ratio<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.429> milk<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
color what is the ratio for the milk and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
color what is the ratio for the milk and
how<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.179> cook<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> milk<00:01:58.259> it's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
how do you cook it so the milk it's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.850 
how do you cook it so the milk it's
different<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.280> this<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:01.050> about<00:02:01.289> 30<00:02:01.590> ice

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
different like this will be about 30 ice

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.669 
different like this will be about 30 ice
cream<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.520> better<00:02:02.910> liter<00:02:03.570> gallon<00:02:04.289> milk<00:02:04.470> is

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
cream so better liter gallon milk is

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.050 
cream so better liter gallon milk is
good<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.130> cook<00:02:05.429> for<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:05.759> three

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
good and cook for about three

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.249 
good and cook for about three
three-and-a-half<00:02:06.600> hour

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
three-and-a-half hour

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.560 
three-and-a-half hour
it's<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.679> very<00:02:08.130> low<00:02:08.429> heat<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.420> heat

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
it's on a very low heat so the heat

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.690 
it's on a very low heat so the heat
doesn't<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.019> -<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:10.979> through<00:02:11.009> milk

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
doesn't go - if you will go through milk

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
doesn't go - if you will go through milk
will<00:02:11.850> get<00:02:11.970> better<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.900> will<00:02:13.050> have

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
will get better right and you will have

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.479 
will get better right and you will have
very<00:02:13.530> done<00:02:14.840> tasty<00:02:15.840> ice<00:02:15.989> cream<00:02:16.260> great<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.310> when

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
very done tasty ice cream great so when

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.920 
very done tasty ice cream great so when
you're<00:02:17.610> cooking<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.300> milk

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
you're cooking this like milk

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.390 
you're cooking this like milk
are<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.110> putting<00:02:19.290> anything<00:02:19.769> else<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.280> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
are you putting anything else in it to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
are you putting anything else in it to
start<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:21.390> carve<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.810> mint<00:02:21.989> pistachio

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
start just carve a mint pistachio

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.740 
start just carve a mint pistachio
I<00:02:22.709> think<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.430> put<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.239> cook<00:02:24.630> it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
I think and just put it in and cook it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.229

or even if you want that raw flavor you
can<00:02:27.390> use<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.049> there<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
can use it in there and what is the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.120 
can use it in there and what is the
ratio<00:02:29.310> how<00:02:29.850> rich<00:02:30.150> look<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.930> simple<00:02:31.440> gallon

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
ratio how rich look it's simple gallon

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.050 
ratio how rich look it's simple gallon
