set here um I'm Brianna you know he's a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
set here um I'm Brianna you know he's a
dark-type<00:00:33.660> um<00:00:34.079> he<00:00:34.440> has<00:00:34.559> synchronised<00:00:35.100> an

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
dark-type um he has synchronised an

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
dark-type um he has synchronised an
inner<00:00:35.460> focus<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.149> um<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.450> he<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:36.660> inner<00:00:36.870> focus

inner focus but um if he has inner focus

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.720 
inner focus but um if he has inner focus
he<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> sucker<00:00:37.920> punch<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
because he has the heal Bell synchronize

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
because he has the heal Bell synchronize
he<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.710> rid<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> status<00:00:44.520> plus<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.030> can

maximum amount of power possible um his

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.939 
maximum amount of power possible um his
base<00:01:02.850> SATs<00:01:03.149> only<00:01:03.420> 65<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:04.710> gonna<00:01:04.830> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
base SATs only 65 but we're gonna be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
base SATs only 65 but we're gonna be
using<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.309> anyway<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.610> um<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.260> set<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
using it anyway so um I use this set I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.840 
using it anyway so um I use this set I
use<00:01:07.740> max<00:01:08.010> HP<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.700> attack<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.390> um<00:01:10.250> 394<00:01:11.250> HP<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
use max HP in attack so um 394 HP is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.450 
use max HP in attack so um 394 HP is
never<00:01:12.060> bad<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.750> um<00:01:12.990> base<00:01:13.229> 110<00:01:13.799> defense<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
never bad with um base 110 defense in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.910 
never bad with um base 110 defense in
130<00:01:15.119> he'll<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.990> bulky<00:01:16.259> even<00:01:16.710> though<00:01:16.799> he

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
130 he'll be bulky even though he

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.690 
130 he'll be bulky even though he
doesn't<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.250> significant<00:01:17.939> investment<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
doesn't have significant investment and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
doesn't have significant investment and
I'm<00:01:21.270> his<00:01:21.479> speed<00:01:21.780> stat<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.470> important

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
I'm his speed stat really is important

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.390 
I'm his speed stat really is important
but<00:01:23.250> um<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.549> should<00:01:23.759> probably<00:01:24.000> try<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> have

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
but um you should probably try to have

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
but um you should probably try to have
zero<00:01:26.400> IVs<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> speed<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.659> payback

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
zero IVs and speed for payback

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.990 
zero IVs and speed for payback
just<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.310> um<00:01:29.460> payback<00:01:30.150> I'll<00:01:30.390> always<00:01:30.810> hit<00:01:31.530> last

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
just so um payback I'll always hit last

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
just so um payback I'll always hit last
anyway<00:01:33.000> um<00:01:33.180> he's<00:01:33.570> V's<00:01:33.900> our<00:01:34.110> max<00:01:34.380> attack<00:01:34.710> max<00:01:35.100> HP

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
anyway um he's V's our max attack max HP

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.289 
anyway um he's V's our max attack max HP
I<00:01:36.000> already<00:01:36.570> said<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.490> six<00:01:38.490> special<00:01:38.970> defense

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
I already said that six special defense

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
I already said that six special defense
just<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.780> filler<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:40.829> it'll<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
just for filler I think it'll be like

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.960 
just for filler I think it'll be like
297<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.210> 30<00:01:42.479> Bonnie<00:01:42.689> IVs<00:01:43.640> his<00:01:44.640> moves

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
297 if you have 30 Bonnie IVs his moves

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.990 
297 if you have 30 Bonnie IVs his moves
here<00:01:45.270> they're<00:01:45.450> important<00:01:45.960> payback<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:47.000> just

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
here they're important payback is just

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.569 
here they're important payback is just
you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.479> does<00:01:48.990> 20<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.740> base<00:01:49.979> power<00:01:50.310> than

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you know it does 20 more base power than

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370 
you know it does 20 more base power than
Sucker<00:01:51.090> Punch<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:51.899> predict<00:01:52.229> your
