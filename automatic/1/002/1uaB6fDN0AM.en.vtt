00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:06.905
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:09.870
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:20.760
First, let’s cut the vegetables.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.967
Slice the red onion into thin slices.

00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:33.787
Soak the onion in ice water to reduce the pungent taste.

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:41.882
Peel the cucumber with a peeler in a striped pattern.

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:45.233
Cut it in half lengthwise.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.213
Then, slice it into thin slices using diagonal cuts.

00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.786
Remove the root part of the kaiware radish sprouts 

00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:00.748
or garden cress and cut them in half.

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:07.985
Now, squeeze out the excess water from the onion 

00:01:08.808 --> 00:01:11.128
and place it onto a plate.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:15.349
Next, let’s make the dipping sauce.

00:01:15.427 --> 00:01:21.007
To the white sesame paste, add a little soba noodle soup base 

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.365
and stir to dissolve.

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:26.675
Add the soup base in 2 to 3 steps 

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:30.184
to help prevent the sauce from separating.

00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:35.713
Add the grated ginger root, stir and the sesame sauce is ready.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.503
Now, let’s cook the noodles.

00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:50.889
Place the frozen soba noodles into a pot of boiling water.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:55.813
Loosen up the noodles on high heat 

00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:00.866
and then, turn off the burner.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.194
Remove the soba with a mesh strainer 

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:11.264
and place it into cold water or rinse under running water.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:21.742
Next, allow the soba to cool in a bowl of ice water.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:28.799
Then, squeeze out the excess water 

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:34.519
and place the soba into a bowl.

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:37.727
Add the sesame oil 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.224
and toss to coat.

00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:44.609
This will help to keep the noodles from sticking together.

00:02:49.638 --> 00:02:53.101
Now, place the very thin pork loin slices 

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.579
into the same hot water in the pot.

00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:02.634
Stir the slices until they turn white 

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:09.350
and place them onto the cutting board covered with a paper towel.

00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:14.325
Remove the excess water thoroughly.

00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.943
Then, cut the pork into bite-size pieces.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.672
Now, arrange the toppings onto the soba noodles.

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:28.635
Add the kimchi, fermented Korean side dish, 

00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:31.532
red onion, 

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:35.559
cucumber 

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.603
and pork slices.

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:46.325
Finally, distribute the kaiware radish sprouts on top.

00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:53.270
A number of different Japanese toppings go great with this recipe.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.141
Try adding tempura, toasted nori seaweed 

00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.395
or natto, fermented soybeans.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.786
Dip the soba and vegetables into the chilled sesame sauce 

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:06.738
and enjoy the refreshing crisp taste.

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:19.674
Along with the noodles, 

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:25.003
this recipe offers a full balanced meal with meat and vegetables.

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.831
Good luck in the kitchen.
