00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.780
 Dark Souls is an action RPG known for its extreme difficulty and for the incredible 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.030
 mechanics of their final bosses, which make the combats epic, highlighting 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.980
 especially two heads over the rest for their difficulty. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.850
 The giant deformity of fire called "Unceasing Discharge" deserves the second place in 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.850
 my list. 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.460
 As soon as he discovers us stealing the golden armor, he starts attacking us 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.711
 with his arms of fire in a random and unpredictable way and not only that, but the 

00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:33.990
 combat is designed so that it is always a varied challenge and there is no possible trick 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.520
 to kill him easily. 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.190
 The powerful Molinete is a necromancer whose lair is in the catacombs, wearing 3 masks, 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.210
 makes copies of himself, teleports himself and throws fireballs, which makes this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.310
 fight a real hell. 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.780
 Undoubtedly the most challenging boss of the Dark Souls, so he is in first place 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.570
 from my list. 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:08.150
 Well, now seriously, I'm going to tell you about my TOP 5 of the Dark Souls' final bosses. 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.290
 The Demon of Aries is a warrior with a goat's head, armed with two large machetes 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.960
 and that awaits us in the lower area of ​​the Burgo of the undead. 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.030
 The fight takes place in a small room and in addition to the demon there will be two zombie dogs 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 to increase the difficulty of the confrontation. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.900
 As much for its difficulty as for the design of this meeting and the boss, the combat against 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.680
 the demon of Aries is for me the fifth best boss of the Dark Souls. 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.610
 In the fourth place of my TOP 5 I choose the Four Kings. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.560
 These 4 new Londo leaders were recognized by Gwyn, but they fell into obscurity after 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.049
 that a primitive serpent offered them the art of stealing humanity. 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.500
 The Four Kings are in the abyss, in the center of the area flooded with Ruins 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.869
 of Nuevo Londo. 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.040
 This infinite zone of darkness can only be accessed with the Artorias ring, because 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.340
 but when we throw ourselves into the abyss, we will die irremediably. 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.090
 As soon as we enter the abyss these kings will come out one by one and will attack us so much 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 with his arcane powers, as with his strange halberds. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.120
 If we take a long time to kill the first king, the second one will come out and we will have to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.930
 fight against two enemies at once. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.150
 Both for the approach of the combat, for its difficulty and for its original design, the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.550
 Four Kings deserve a spot in the TOP 5 bosses of Dark Souls. 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.489
 Nito the king of the cemetery is one of the gentlemen beings who found the souls of the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.860
 gentlemen within the original flame and defeated the eternal dragons. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.120
 It is a God of death and sickness and is the leader of the covenant of the servants of the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.870
 cemetery. 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.489
 This gigantic being rests in a coffin in the deepest part of the Tomb of the Giants 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.140
 and is composed of human skeletal remains and is armed with a giant blade 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.710
 which inflicts poison damage. 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.310
 In addition, Nito is guarded by skeleton warriors who will resurrect indefinitely, 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 unless their lord dies or we kill them with divine weapons. 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.910
 This macabre being will attack us with his blade both short and long distance and will try 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.090
 finish us with explosions of miasma and rot. 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.690
 Both for its chilling and macabre design, as for the original and difficult mechanics 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.450
 of the combat, Nito the King of the Cemetery deserves the third place in my list of 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.510
 best bosses of Dark Souls. 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.629
 Gwyn, Lord of the Ash, is the last boss of the Dark Souls and is one of the gods that 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.870
 beat the immortal dragons. 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.290
 The same was sacrificed to light the original flame, thousands of years before the events 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.920
 of the game. 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.159
 This warrior god is extremely fast and aggressive and uses a sword of fire 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.220
 to attack us without stopping. 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.599
 If we move away from him he will charge us with a jump attack, and unless we use 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.430
 shields with a lot of stability, will break our guard based on swords. 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.841
 Because of the difficulty of facing Gwyn, due to his speed and attack power and so 

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:07.550
 Epic of combat, Gwyn, Lord of the Ash, deserves the second place in my TOP 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.629
 5 of Dark Souls bosses. 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.319
 Ornstein the dragon slayer and Smough the executioner are undoubtedly the best bosses of the 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.029
 Dark Souls and wait for us in the cathedral of Anor Londo. 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.439
 Ornstein is the captain of the 4 kings of Gwyn and carries a spear imbued with electricity. 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:30.219
 Smough is the real hangman and is armed with a giant hammer. 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:35.240
 At the beginning of the fight we will have to face against these 2 enemies at once, with the only 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.780
 help from the pillars of the cathedral, which will serve to rest from time to time. 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.940
 Ornstein is very fast, he throws electric beams and will charge us continuously and 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.999
 will attack us without stopping. 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:51.250
 Smough is a very agile giant that will try to crush us with his hammer or throw us 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.740
 airs with their tremendous onslaught. 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.119
 But not only that, but when we defeat one of these warriors the second one will begin 

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:59.249
 phase. 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.349
 If Smough is defeated first, Ornstein will pray over his body and absorb his power, 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.699
 doubling its size, but maintaining its speed and electrical power. 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.380
 And if we beat Ornstein first, Smough will kill the dragon slayer with his hammer, increasing 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.729
 its power with electricity. 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.860
 This combat stands out for many aspects: The design of Ornstein and Smough is impeccable, 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.050
 being the Dragon Slayer's armor one of the most beautiful in the game and the fat one 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.369
 Executor Smough one of the disgusting. 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:33.479
 The cathedral of Anor Londo is impressive and its pillars do not only exist as a decoration, 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.629
 but they are key to the development of combat. 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.169
 This confrontation has 3 phases with totally different mechanics: 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.590
 In the first one we fought against two powerful warriors at the same time, one very fast and aggressive, 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.910
 Ornstein, and another not so fast but with devastating blows, Smough. 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.280
 If we kill Smough first, we will have to face a super powerful Ornstein 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.939
 and very fast and we will have no choice but to place ourselves under him, or we will be 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.110
 his lances. 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.919
 On the other hand, if we finish with the dragon slayer first, super Smough will be a rival that 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.999
 It will kill with very few hits, but we can use the columns for small breaths. 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.979
 Nor should we forget the epic melody that plays in the background and from which we will end 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.009
 fed up with so much listening. 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.569
 For these reasons, I think that without a doubt Ornstein and Smough deserve the first place in 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.779
 of the bosses of Dark Souls and probably of all the souls saga.
