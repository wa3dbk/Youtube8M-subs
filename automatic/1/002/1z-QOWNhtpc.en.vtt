00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
plugged up just in case but I just

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.260 
plugged up just in case but I just
basically<00:00:31.070> remove<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.309> pins<00:00:36.680> come<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.270> like

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
basically remove the pins come on like

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
basically remove the pins come on like
that<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> back<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.590> was

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that you see how this in the back I was

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.959 
that you see how this in the back I was
kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.449> yeah<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.969> because

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
kind of bit there yeah and this because

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
kind of bit there yeah and this because
of<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:55.039> curls<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.340> laid<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:58.399> take

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
of how curls and I laid on it so take

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.530 
of how curls and I laid on it so take
them<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.610> dinner<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> used

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
them so I have my dinner so what I used

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
them so I have my dinner so what I used
to<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:07.010> is<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> through<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to do is just go through and kind of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.469 
to do is just go through and kind of
work<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.090> out

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:34.860 

I<00:01:24.590> think<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.680> cold<00:01:25.950> or<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.219> home

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.050 

so<00:01:35.870> it's<00:01:36.050> going<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:36.290> be<00:01:36.410> very<00:01:37.010> tight<00:01:37.310> because

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
so it's going to be very tight because

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.170 
so it's going to be very tight because
of<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.480> kernels<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:40.490> don't<00:01:40.760> like<00:01:40.970> the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
of the kernels and if you don't like the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.320 
of the kernels and if you don't like the
you<00:01:41.600> know<00:01:41.660> very<00:01:42.080> tight<00:01:42.410> look<00:01:42.650> then<00:01:43.120> your<00:01:44.120> best

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
you know very tight look then your best

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.100 
you know very tight look then your best
bet<00:01:44.480> will<00:01:44.690> probably<00:01:45.020> be<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.590> rapid<00:01:46.990> after<00:01:47.990> you

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
bet will probably be so rapid after you

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.780 
bet will probably be so rapid after you
fed<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.650> rolls<00:01:48.860> out<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.310> won't<00:01:52.550> have

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
fed on the rolls out so you won't have

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.280 
fed on the rolls out so you won't have
such<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> tiger<00:01:53.330> gives<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.870> little<00:01:54.110> more

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
such a tiger gives you a little more

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.740 
such a tiger gives you a little more
relaxed<00:01:54.890> but<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:55.580> me<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.820> like<00:01:56.120> to<00:01:56.330> do<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.720> just

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
relaxed but like me I like to do it just

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.180 
relaxed but like me I like to do it just
because<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.350> lasts<00:01:57.680> longer<00:01:58.220> and<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.950> when<00:02:04.100> I

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
because it lasts longer and then when I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.030 
because it lasts longer and then when I
do<00:02:04.250> eventually<00:02:04.550> start<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:06.410> wrapping<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.890> at

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
do eventually start just wrapping it at

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.280 
do eventually start just wrapping it at
night<00:02:11.410> it'll<00:02:12.410> lay<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> little<00:02:12.920> better<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.340> me

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
night it'll lay a little better for me

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:32.530 
night it'll lay a little better for me
last<00:02:15.290> week<00:02:15.770> over

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.240 

but<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.439> like<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.549> said<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:34.909> kind<00:02:35.329> of<00:02:36.250> look

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
but on like I said I just kind of look

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.220 
but on like I said I just kind of look
at<00:02:37.430> how<00:02:37.579> I'm<00:02:37.760> warning<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.950> goodness<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:41.780> stays

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
at how I'm warning so goodness it stays

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.080 
at how I'm warning so goodness it stays
and<00:02:42.620> those<00:02:42.739> curls<00:02:43.159> pretty<00:02:43.430> nice<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:43.939> you

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
know me my hair kind of falls -

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.470 
know me my hair kind of falls -
especially<00:02:59.870> if<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.560> wind<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:00.950> blowing<00:03:01.099> or<00:03:01.639> if

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
especially if the wind is blowing or if

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.740 
especially if the wind is blowing or if
it's<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:02.750> little<00:03:02.900> humid<00:03:03.260> outside<00:03:03.409> anyway

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
it's a little humid outside anyway

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.569 
it's a little humid outside anyway
so<00:03:06.760> once<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.909> elements<00:03:08.389> kind<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.689> get<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.049> it

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
so once the elements kind of get to it

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.000 
so once the elements kind of get to it
it<00:03:10.579> kind<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.879> falls<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.540> right<00:03:14.169> so<00:03:15.169> I'm<00:03:15.769> just

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it kind of falls just right so I'm just

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.729 
it kind of falls just right so I'm just
kind<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.340> put<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.519> little<00:03:16.609> bit<00:03:17.439> heat<00:03:18.439> on<00:03:18.590> those

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739
