00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.169
 today we are going to talk about a product 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.820
 which is the mint that is an extract from 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.730
 a plant that has been used by 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.099
 many years especially for Libyans and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.099
 stomachs, however, different 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.390
 studies have shown that it has 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.700
 capabilities to improve the question of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.300
 smell also has help for 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.130
 questions about the skin and well let's 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 mention the 23 points of how it is used and 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.870
 only mentioned in other uses 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.200
 as well, we always invite you to consult the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.570
 page that appears 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.850
 at the foot of this video and can you 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.280
 have much more information 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.460

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.890
 mint watching a presentation of 5 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.240
 milliliters and 15 milliliters in this 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.640
 case is 65 and then this is a product 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.720
 very versatile just like the band that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.720
 personally 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.870
 and other products also comes from 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.850
 individually and comes in a package 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.430
 which is the package of intentions that 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.440
 we will be talking too and I would like 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.950
 start by mentioning for example a 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.760
 very common very common use very common 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.100
 due to our country in facts I 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.470
 I think derivative of stress a lot of pain 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 cannes in this case in a very 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.510
 Simple instead of taking a pill 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.729
 it has been shown that many times the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.950
 allopathic question engineer in the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.760
 pill we get one thing but we do not 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.890
 affects others 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.410
 in this case the mint only has to be 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.750
 put a droplet in our palm of the 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.020
 hand 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.040
 and let's go and put it on your forehead 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 and in the mica and it seems incredible but in 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.020
 approximately 30 or 40 seconds you 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.950
 they will start to notice a relief 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.470
 excellent and it will start to calm down 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.780
 this is a use of the many that can 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 have while we are going to mention others or 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.980
 also very common is for when we have 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.980
 upset stomach if in this case it 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.250
