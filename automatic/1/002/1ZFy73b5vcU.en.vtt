00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.150
 the night Watch 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.340
 everybody get out of the dusk today for that is 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.110
 we have two opel cars at once and he would 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.880
 with apple lighting and turbo 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.410
 Do engines have mosquitoes on the second 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.630
 level will not eat us at all then we 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.970
 show everything what they can do 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.310
 i started do without comparisons and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.279
 delve into those details which interest 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.170
 foreheads and lighting them really 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.300
 intellectual systems that give 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.260
 opportunity to forget about how 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.940
 to use 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.880
 You do not need any priest, if not go 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.410
 in technical details then the lighting in 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.690
 car made in such a way that 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 gives you maximum visibility on the road 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.400
 outdoor lighting allows you to see 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 the road is good in any conditions even 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.230
 the heaviest in the rain is snow and other things 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.570
 circumstances that may interfere 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.430
 see an obstacle on the road in new a 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.239
 fear that Jett Firsov sedan 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.790
 used 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.480
 ai file lighting ie last 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.480
 technology 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.730
 namely the camera on one glass which 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.890
 It captures all the traffic signs road 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.040
 cover here depending on this 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.370
 distributes bi-xenon lighting then 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.420
 there can not only rotate lenses 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.790
 steering wheel 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.870
 well and make more dim light if 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.810
 went asphalt response can also 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.260
 throw out one lens on the side to not 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.920
 blind 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.110
 the rest to remove the left lens system ai 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 file is a combination of the dynamic function 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.860
 and statistical cornering lighting 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.810
 due to which significantly reduced 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.550
 risk of road traffic 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.740
 accidents at night 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.440
 Abel became the first manufacturer to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.720
 introduced the ai file system to the market back in 2002 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.670
 g 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.070
 switch from high beam to low beam 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.870
 change only the direction of the beam that 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.710
 allows you to avoid a pause during 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.710
 adventures 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.570
 that's where it really stretches 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.460
 compelling force in both cars so 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.289
 this driver's seat is stylish 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.240
 pleasant to touch sports 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.160
 instrument panel wells comfortable grip 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.140
 gear shift check how 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.860
 almost sports interior is reflected 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 driving character 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.240
 despite a more sporty appearance 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.520
 Ji si both cars on dynamic 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.410
 characteristics almost 1a 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.140
 Well pointed suspension used under 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.550
 titled flex wright she me this is the level 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.830
 stiffness ie you can put a tour and 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.320
 then the suspension will be more like this 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.350
 softer or you can put the sport 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.170
 then the suspension mode will also change 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.720
 the course of the shock absorbers themselves and also 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.720
 Auto Moto mode will change 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.400
 car handling is another 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.430
 main plus which can be added 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.379
 chip all the other minimum banks in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.980
 cornering is very obedient and steering 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.709
 wheel 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.769
 astra ji si brand new 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.470
 suspension which when entering a turn 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.269
 me this is my wheel alignment 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.760
 negative respectively machine 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.500
 enters the turn like a glove and now 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.599
 move on to comparative positions 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.400
 much easier to find them outside among them 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.239
 there are quite obvious such as 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.220
 Number of doors 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.870
 live with them add to them 5 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.970
 respectively, the trunk in a sedan 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.160
 more voluminous and gives the car solidity 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.569
 here we return to the topic sincere 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.569
 Russians love sedan 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 and 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.720
 on 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.290
 for the rest, the exterior of the cars are similar 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.580
 in its aggressiveness inside the car 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.280
 find differences first 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.690
 associated with the structure of the body seems that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.660
 three-door hatchbacks 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.700
 sitting back will be uncomfortable at the very 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.400
 itâ€™s a place above head and for legs 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.240
 enough and if you like you can sit down 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.920
 even three 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.110
 so how do i talk about the cost 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.790
 the car 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.830
 under which it is considered to be almost 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.630
 the fundamental course of choosing a car 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.640
 so if we talk about the family 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.890
 the severity of any car and row ready 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.530
 we put more for less with 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.820
 my class is almost all for 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.970
 young for a young client than for 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.340
 family man 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.080
 but for the family man so it will reach astra 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.480
 sedan is spacious enough 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.320
 excellent insulation excellent suspension 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:06.370
 very soft and with a minimum of aluminum that 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.910
 allows you to rarely change any consumable 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.950
 materials 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.350
 to make sure of the above 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.180
 You can come to the auto show region 62 to 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.180
 the official dealer of opel in Ryazan
