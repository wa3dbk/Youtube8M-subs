00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
a few years ago I posted a video of a

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.880 
a few years ago I posted a video of a
workbench<00:00:03.149> I've<00:00:03.389> built<00:00:03.629> for<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> few<00:00:04.710> friends

people<00:00:08.069> viewed<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.429> than<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.700> had<00:00:09.269> ever

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
people viewed it than I had ever

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.900 
people viewed it than I had ever
expected<00:00:09.660> which<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.349> great<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.860> there's<00:00:11.670> been

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
expected which is great and there's been

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.280 
expected which is great and there's been
a<00:00:11.940> steady<00:00:12.210> stream<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.540> questions<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:13.019> how

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
a steady stream of questions about how

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410 
a steady stream of questions about how
the<00:00:13.349> lift<00:00:13.590> system<00:00:13.740> worked<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.089> put<00:00:15.330> this

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the lift system worked so I put this

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.029 
the lift system worked so I put this
video<00:00:15.599> together<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.230> show<00:00:16.410> some<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.859> in

I<00:00:26.039> counted<00:00:26.369> board<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.880> legs<00:00:27.949> let's<00:00:28.949> take

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
I counted board into the legs let's take

I counted board into the legs let's take
away<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> bottom<00:00:29.849> shelf<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> closer

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
away the bottom shelf and have a closer

00:00:31.050 --> 00:01:28.080 
away the bottom shelf and have a closer
look<00:00:31.199> at<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> laborer<00:00:32.099> lifting<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> table

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.610 

the<00:01:29.090> cam<00:01:29.330> was<00:01:29.510> configured<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.050> lift<00:01:30.230> one<00:01:30.440> into

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
the cam was configured to lift one into

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.280 
the cam was configured to lift one into
the<00:01:30.710> table<00:01:31.040> about<00:01:31.280> 3/4<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:31.910> an<00:01:32.120> inch<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.200> the

the table about 3/4 of an inch so the
two<00:01:33.440> cam<00:01:33.710> radius<00:01:34.100> were<00:01:34.250> set<00:01:34.580> at<00:01:35.060> one<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.420> a

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
two cam radius were set at one and a

two cam radius were set at one and a
half<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:35.960> two<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.320> quarter<00:01:36.470> inches<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.040> get

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
half and two and a quarter inches to get

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.240 
half and two and a quarter inches to get
that<00:01:37.340> difference<00:01:37.760> as<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:39.350> lever<00:01:39.530> pivots<00:01:39.800> down

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
that difference as the lever pivots down

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.000 
that difference as the lever pivots down
the<00:01:41.180> cam<00:01:41.420> contact<00:01:41.990> transitions<00:01:42.710> from<00:01:42.890> the

the table legs up next let's have a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.150 
the table legs up next let's have a
closer<00:01:47.900> look<00:01:48.020> at<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.380> caster<00:01:49.010> wheel

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
closer look at that caster wheel

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:09.340 
closer look at that caster wheel
carriage<00:01:49.490> assembly<00:02:07.660> this<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> closer<00:02:09.050> view

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
carriage assembly this is a closer view

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.080 
carriage assembly this is a closer view
of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.560> cam<00:02:09.860> lever<00:02:10.130> since<00:02:10.760> there's<00:02:10.940> no

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
of the cam lever since there's no

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.790 
of the cam lever since there's no
undercarriage<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.750> press<00:02:11.990> down<00:02:12.200> obviously

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
undercarriage to press down obviously

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.060 
undercarriage to press down obviously
it's<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.459> free<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:14.290> rotate<00:02:15.290> down<00:02:15.740> and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
it's just free to rotate down and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.340 
it's just free to rotate down and
there's<00:02:16.520> nothing<00:02:16.640> forcing<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.959> legs<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.290> this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
there's nothing forcing the legs of this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.520 
there's nothing forcing the legs of this
table<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.770> go<00:02:18.890> up<00:02:19.959> when<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:20.990> first<00:02:21.290> thought

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
table to go up when I first thought

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.080 
table to go up when I first thought
about<00:02:21.770> this<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.160> thought<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.580> would<00:02:22.790> rest

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
about this I thought this would rest

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.330 
about this I thought this would rest
right<00:02:23.330> about<00:02:23.600> here<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.260> give<00:02:24.920> me<00:02:25.010> plenty<00:02:25.220> of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
right about here and give me plenty of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.060 
right about here and give me plenty of
room<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.550> put<00:02:25.850> my<00:02:26.030> toes<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:27.080> my<00:02:27.470> shoe<00:02:27.709> right<00:02:27.920> in

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
room to put my toes of my shoe right in

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.520 
room to put my toes of my shoe right in
here<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.120> actuality<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:30.050> sits<00:02:30.320> right

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
here but in actuality it sits right

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.330 
here but in actuality it sits right
about<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.130> spot<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.070> kind<00:02:34.280> of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
about this spot and so I have to kind of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.720 
about this spot and so I have to kind of
pull<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.060> away<00:02:35.239> from<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:37.250> order<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.610> get

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
pull this away from that in order to get

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.370 
pull this away from that in order to get
my<00:02:37.850> foot<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.180> there<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.870> had<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.230> this

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
my foot in there if I had to do this

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.330 
my foot in there if I had to do this
whole<00:02:39.530> thing<00:02:39.560> over

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
whole thing over

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.729 
whole thing over
I<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:41.180> extend<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:43.340> either<00:02:43.640> further<00:02:44.120> or

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
I would extend this either further or

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.210 
I would extend this either further or
maybe<00:02:45.739> cut<00:02:46.459> some<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:46.970> out<00:02:47.180> or<00:02:47.540> maybe<00:02:48.440> I'd

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
maybe cut some of this out or maybe I'd

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.340 
maybe cut some of this out or maybe I'd
find<00:02:49.459> some<00:02:49.760> way<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.390> where<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.780> doesn't<00:02:51.050> sit

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
find some way to where this doesn't sit

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.040 
find some way to where this doesn't sit
flush<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.610> does<00:02:52.760> now<00:02:53.050> but

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
flush like that like it does now but

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.949 
flush like that like it does now but
otherwise<00:02:54.820> I'm<00:02:55.820> happy<00:02:56.209> with<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.600> pulling

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
otherwise I'm happy with it just pulling

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.449 
otherwise I'm happy with it just pulling
it<00:02:57.050> out<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:57.590> kicking<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.040> down<00:02:58.160> with<00:02:58.310> my

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it out and then kicking it down with my

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.870
