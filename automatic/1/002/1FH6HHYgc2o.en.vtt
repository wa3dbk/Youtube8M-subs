00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.980
 Hello guys 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.890
 I came to show you today. 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.460
 eyeliner an adhesive that is super 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.090
 practical and good for those who do not have much 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.809
 ability with the normal eyeliner or 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.540
 simply that is the very practicality 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.410
 because he does the hard work for you 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.320
 which is straight from the top and do the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.659
 whole risk 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.629
 so come on, look, I got the 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.150
 chapel I cut what I wanted and 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.500
 I rounded the bottom of the company 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.420
 line of eyeliner is to measure the eyes 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.290
 also looks he got redondinho take 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.420
 Giving In The Eyes Shot Plastic Quino He 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.250
 is it that no tattoo knows that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.900
 Tattoo boy, that's it, that's going to put 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.920
 eyes in the place you want to put 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.930
 the eyeliner 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.549
 I 'm taking a cotton swab over the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.320
 makeup even it does not spoil 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.550
 make-up or you can do all the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.490
 normal makeup on the eyelid and then 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.570
 put the eyeliner while net and a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.080
 tea with him of water and I'll put it 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.890
 part afternoon in the eyeliner knowing that 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.160
 he will stick to his eyes will not 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.420
 spoil the makeup I repeat you can 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.860
 do it right, then you should go 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.480
 well look at everything 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.220
 This is the first time I was 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.170
 placing already on video not 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.430
 I tested before the video, okay? I tested it. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 straight into the video 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.240
 So I pick up a little bit to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.759
 first time 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.310
 although for being the first time I think 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.870
 That's pretty cool. 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.270
 now I took it when he's okay 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.140
 wet it already loose whole then 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.540
 you do not have trouble taking notes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760
 which was a gap between the top 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.320
 and the underside 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.200
 that we can count on the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.140
 eyeliner then but there but then which 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.910
 it is the advantage is much easier you 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.280
 complete only the bottom of what 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.050
 you make the whole risk agree 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.270
 if you do not have much way for this 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.260
 risk is ready you only paint there where 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.750
 I'm missing, and yes, I'm going to put it now. 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.540
 other side you will notice that the other 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.830
 I put it on and it was different from 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.720
 first 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.290
 it's this symmetry you go with time 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.620
 wearing eyeliner I believe 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.930
 can you get it right just 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.730
 anyway he may have fixed 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.420
 with the eyeliner itself at the end is here 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.130
 O putting it on I've already cut it 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.709
 It's not eye-measurement to see if it's 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.600
 all right he got a little more 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.890
 into what the other 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.890
 another with a little more out looks only 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.840
 look well 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.470
 with him very wet he releases the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.230
 paper 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.680
 is the same principle of that tattoo of 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.500
 mouth goes beyond books is also well 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 cool that we even have on the site to 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.040
 sell also 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.390
 Look, he's just a little bit longer for 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.330
 within which the other 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.610
 plus the other with a little more 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.080
 stretched the corner but that's what we're going to 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.510
 Fixing the eyeliner, then I got 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.600
 in the gel liner to pack 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.090
 look at and see the difference it was is 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.260
 the same taxi I put of the same 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.420
 even though I put it aside 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.070
 I put the other's personal difference 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.690
 here I put another one over there 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.830
 I put it over here 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.690
 now I'm cleaning the eyeliner 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.840
 now is the following you can paint only the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.060
 bottom and stretch the bottom 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.500
 end in the case here that was what I 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.040
 needed to do 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.480
 Only I went to dress up 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.990
 and I ended up the top part was half 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.000
 and it was the first time I had been 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.220
 putting and do not know 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.940
 Then I started to pull it, it ended up getting 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.760
 thicker than it should have been 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.280
 ugly i liked it 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.350
 however it is has the thicker eyeliner on 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.200
 own chapel and that was not how the zoe 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.800
 leave the thinner so be careful 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.930
 Just not to do this bullshit right there. 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.790
 but if you do you do not have a problem alone 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.570
 one look at that I'm going to get you in the end 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.570
 it will be cool 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.650
 because the good gel eyeliner I 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.360
 I prefer who has already won but other videos 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.150
 You know I prefer Rangel Eyeliner. 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.670
 because it slides very easy and he 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.780
 does not erase is much more accurate than 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.150
 others 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.010
 then even for those who have more difficulty 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:44.150
 with eyeliner or eyeliner in general is 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:44.150
 excellent / good people O're almost there 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.139
 I'm already on top of the makeup 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.729
 all that was ready 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.710
 eyeliner is ready 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.370
 It's right there on the site to sell. 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.990
 Any doubt migrate has a kiss for who 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.990
 it gets boring
