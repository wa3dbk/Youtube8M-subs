00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.360
 if something bad exists well and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.719
 satan comes from the devil 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 here comes the question if the devil 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.760
 This is ideology after that when you 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.040
 demand has an explanation as it is not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.560
 this you do not have 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.750
 if you try to find out but 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.620
 that they say that satan is an angel is not 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 that 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.989
 was this club is based on the ad 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 judicia nÃ© 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.949
 obasi ezequiel 28 who wants to know if 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 there is just reading a book 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.579
 the book explains everything with foundation 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 then says that this satan here he was 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.790
 an angel and became the devil 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 here comes the question how are you going to try 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.360
 get explanations from the bible as it will not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.059
 find find the ezequiel 28 01 14 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 not portrays about it then you 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 Then there is no answer and then the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.090
 which is a well-founded answer 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.159
 when I think it's a foundation is not the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.289
 that is where the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 conception of faith and when to enter this 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.079
 biology area she no longer has the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.090
 to discuss 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.999
 because if I 'll put what I think 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 I 'll put what I think I see 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.499
 how the devil came without putting 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.209
 gdp now we put the find what 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:28.889
 Many people out there want to see where they are going. 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:30.029
 stop now for me to have a year 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.340
 before 

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:34.340
 I have to be here before Adam 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:48.420
 the after there is a conception my hour 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:51.899
 that there is only the creator and the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.999
 creature and that in the image and likeness of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:01.529
 God of Gods God is God is not 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:03.919
 the creative aspect of every creature all 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:07.229
 that exists around us is a 

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:10.140
 development of what already exists and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.239
 we are in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.790
 back from several parts that was a being 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.770
 human being who created and only one being 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 who develops the first 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.890
 tool example here was formerly 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.870
 a blackboard 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.610
 in the black green guinea and the white chalk there 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.380
 someone where the human being from both looking 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.860
 that filthy filth made 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.920
 create the blessed 4 white and the planet to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.570
 she who goes here makes a lot of money 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.570
 then a dressing room both look at the picture 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.890
 white is what the glass shop 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.350
 I do not know how you put a video 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.410
 here the cards house the same way 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.870
 has improved from watching the weather to 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.550
 create for those who write uses the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.650
 technology goes there in the tendon that you 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.560
 either cv from a creative point the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.510
 others have been perfecting 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:09.450
 but it is necessary for you to create 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:13.050
 and develop there must be at the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.420
 matter that if the material is creator 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.500
 You can create from nothing just now. 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.739
 we find that for there to be 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 nothing anything already has a shape of you 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.150
 Dude, you just did not have to be human. 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.510
 arrives at the particle of god was 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.049
 necessary to create a mega machine then 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.209
 needed that of matter 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:40.440
 now imagine this will be put with the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.760
 devil and the angel as he developed 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.730
 because he is a creature and every creature 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.640
 has the power of development as it 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.160
 developed or created or created evil 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.190
 within himself excluding God 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.610
 be the author of evil can reach a 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.290
 thesis that god is not the author of evil but 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.010
 that is only the devil as author of 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.239
 evil is necessary that this satan is 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.030
 angelic cider to yours 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:13.140
 creative development be after the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.799
 creation of the human being of mankind and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.729
 not before because I have that selfishness 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.100
 and his fall is before man 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.960
 there will be complex I understand creating 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.090
 a thesis how he created 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.950
 this evil has developed badly now if I 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.370
 I have to have the chair after the creation of 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.530
 man how to understand 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.380
 first god give a world to be 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.160
 human my world 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.380
 god gave regalia god of opposing god 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.560
 of a partner gave without many others 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.010
 things and I bring the conception that this 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.290
 It is so much to observe because we 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.210
 we create by what we observe if 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.780
 it was not we do not want anything like 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.710
 this creature begins to observe the 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.699
 that human being begins to deal with 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.610
 and of observing him by himself and he 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.530
 generates what we call evil 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.350
 so I exclude god and be the evil creator 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.000
 only that for that I depend that the man 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.600
 after and then it creates and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.190
 develops what from seeing so much care 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.120
 God has a man God has with 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.370
 physical matter independent of the 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.780
 land and that this will not be 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.330
 spiritual 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.090
 he has much less regalia than this 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.639
 be that matter that being that matter 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.099
 he has a world to care for and have a 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.849
 the world to enjoy a world of 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.160
 to enjoy this spiritual drought is not 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.320
 office is limited within one 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.630
 spiritual kingdom while the one here 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.440
 that matter is not loose in the woods 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.410
 to do what he wants 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.500
 I observe that Satan saw it and generates 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.780
 evil within himself to the point of wanting 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.590
 to topple the matter that was what God 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.150
 created 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.430
 This is how I conceived the idea and thesis of 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.060
 how it came out bad inside if it will be great 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:23.610
 excluding god as author 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.610
 This is my thesis.
