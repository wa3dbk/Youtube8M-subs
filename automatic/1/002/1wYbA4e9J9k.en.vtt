00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
water not only taste better but make it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
water not only taste better but make it
better<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.449> you're<00:00:25.230> probably<00:00:25.350> aware

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
better for you so you're probably aware

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.640 
better for you so you're probably aware

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
alkaline which is better for you as well

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.209 
alkaline which is better for you as well
as<00:00:42.390> turning<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> ions<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.100> going

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
as turning the ions and we're not going

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
as turning the ions and we're not going
to<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.430> too<00:00:44.550> technical<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.570> ions<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to get too technical here the ions that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
to get too technical here the ions that
are<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.559> water<00:00:46.890> into<00:00:47.640> positive<00:00:48.120> ions<00:00:48.360> which

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
are in water into positive ions which

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.229 
are in water into positive ions which
are<00:00:48.750> better<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.789> comes<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
are better for you so it comes to the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
are better for you so it comes to the
filter<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> works<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.110> 800<00:00:52.920> liters<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
filter that works with 800 liters of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.740 
filter that works with 800 liters of
water<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.300> obviously<00:00:54.539> buy

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
water and then you can obviously buy

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
water and then you can obviously buy
additional<00:00:55.379> filters<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.610> need<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.030> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
additional filters as you need them so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.290 
additional filters as you need them so
let's<00:00:57.840> crack<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> open<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.820> show<00:01:00.270> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
let's crack this open and first show you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
let's crack this open and first show you
what's<00:01:00.629> included<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.010> we'll

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
what's included in here and then we'll

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.270 
what's included in here and then we'll
get<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.399> exactly<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.239> works<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
get to exactly how it works so we have a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
get to exactly how it works so we have a
beach<00:01:05.640> house<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> North<00:01:06.570> Carolina<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
beach house down in North Carolina and I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320 
beach house down in North Carolina and I
have<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> say<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> things<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.090> look

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have to say one of the things I look

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
have to say one of the things I look
forward<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> every<00:01:10.140> time<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
forward to every time I go there is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.340 
forward to every time I go there is
drinking<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> water<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.750> filter<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
drinking the water from the filter that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
drinking the water from the filter that
we<00:01:13.470> keep<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.920> our<00:01:14.040> refrigerator<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
we keep in our refrigerator there the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
we keep in our refrigerator there the
water<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> beach<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.409> isn't<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.710> great

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
water at the beach just isn't that great

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
water at the beach just isn't that great
you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.460> ocean<00:01:17.820> water<00:01:18.030> filtered<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you know ocean water filtered or this

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
you know ocean water filtered or this
doesn't<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> great<00:01:20.040> taste<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:21.509> use<00:01:21.689> tap

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
doesn't have a great taste so we use tap

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
doesn't have a great taste so we use tap
water<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> pitcher<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.520> keep

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
water and we have a pitcher that we keep

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
water and we have a pitcher that we keep
in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> fridge<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.450> filters<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> water<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
in the fridge that filters the water it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.859 
in the fridge that filters the water it
tastes<00:01:26.220> amazing<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.720> going

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
tastes amazing and I think this is going

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
tastes amazing and I think this is going
to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> similar<00:01:28.350> job<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.040> here's<00:01:29.610> what's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to do a similar job so here's what's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
to do a similar job so here's what's
included<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.350> get<00:01:31.500> an<00:01:31.619> instruction

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
included you do get an instruction

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.060 
included you do get an instruction
manual<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:33.090> actually<00:01:33.360> give<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> pH<00:01:34.740> test

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
manual to actually give you a pH test

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.020 
manual to actually give you a pH test
kit<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.689> exactly<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:38.030> acidic

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
kit so you can see exactly how acidic

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.359 
kit so you can see exactly how acidic
neutral<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.570> alkaline<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:40.320> tap<00:01:40.740> water<00:01:40.770> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
neutral or alkaline your tap water is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
neutral or alkaline your tap water is
and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:41.820> compare<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.350> water<00:01:43.560> that

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and then compare it to the water that

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.490 
and then compare it to the water that
gets<00:01:43.950> filtered<00:01:44.430> by<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.140> tygo<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.380> you're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
gets filtered by the tygo when you're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
gets filtered by the tygo when you're
all<00:01:46.619> done<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.369> let's<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
all done so let's get to that in a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
all done so let's get to that in a
second<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> direction<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
second and then kind of the direction so

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.910 
second and then kind of the direction so
it<00:01:50.939> says<00:01:51.119> before<00:01:51.329> use<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> filter

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it says before use you take the filter

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 
it says before use you take the filter
so<00:01:53.399> let<00:01:53.520> me<00:01:53.610> unscrew<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.299> stuff<00:01:54.600> take

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so let me unscrew all this stuff take

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.069 
so let me unscrew all this stuff take
the<00:01:55.470> filter<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.040> inside<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
the filter that's inside here and you

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
the filter that's inside here and you
submerge<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.439> water<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.070> five<00:01:59.700> minutes

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
submerge it in water for five minutes

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.080 
submerge it in water for five minutes
and<00:02:00.619> when<00:02:01.619> you're<00:02:01.770> ready<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.820> put<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and when you're ready to go you put it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730 
and when you're ready to go you put it
all<00:02:03.149> back<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> other<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.259> essentially

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
all back to the other and essentially

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
all back to the other and essentially
what<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.549> screw<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> filter<00:02:06.090> on

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
what you do is you screw the filter on

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.949 
what you do is you screw the filter on
like<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.129> cap<00:02:08.489> comes<00:02:09.090> off<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
like so and then this cap comes off so I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.680 
like so and then this cap comes off so I
can<00:02:10.200> pop<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> whole<00:02:10.860> cap<00:02:11.190> off<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.330> need<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
can pop this whole cap off if I need to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
can pop this whole cap off if I need to
like<00:02:12.900> so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
like so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.899 
like so
and<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:15.140> take<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> top<00:02:15.680> put<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.159> back<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.610> and

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
and I take the top put it back on and

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.960 
and I take the top put it back on and
then<00:02:17.480> fill<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.290> with<00:02:18.620> water<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.790> see

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
then fill this with water you can see

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.550 
then fill this with water you can see
here<00:02:20.180> turns<00:02:20.780> either<00:02:21.110> way

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
here turns either way

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.369 
here turns either way
this<00:02:21.920> way<00:02:22.190> if<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.269> want<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> put<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> lot<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.170> water

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
this way if I want to put a lot of water

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.460 
this way if I want to put a lot of water
inside<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.069> let<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.000> filter<00:02:26.540> down<00:02:26.690> into

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
inside and let this all filter down into

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.300 
inside and let this all filter down into
the<00:02:27.650> reservoir<00:02:27.980> down<00:02:28.610> below<00:02:29.120> or<00:02:29.860> again<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.069> can

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
the reservoir down below or again I can

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.460 
the reservoir down below or again I can
filter<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.150> straight<00:02:32.480> through<00:02:32.720> if<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.260> so

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
filter it straight through if I so

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.680 
filter it straight through if I so
desire<00:02:33.860> once<00:02:34.580> I'm<00:02:34.790> done<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.239> can<00:02:35.450> turn<00:02:35.599> this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
desire once I'm done I can turn this

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.140 
desire once I'm done I can turn this
thing<00:02:35.750> back<00:02:36.049> over<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.620> pour<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.099> into<00:02:37.280> some

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
thing back over and pour it into some

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.780 
thing back over and pour it into some
other<00:02:38.360> vessel<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.930> drink<00:02:39.230> or<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:40.010> can<00:02:40.430> pop<00:02:40.610> this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
other vessel to drink or I can pop this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.110 
other vessel to drink or I can pop this
top<00:02:41.090> off<00:02:41.329> put<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.230> all<00:02:42.440> together<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.129> drink<00:02:43.790> or

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
top off put it all together and drink or

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.839 
top off put it all together and drink or
pour<00:02:44.750> right<00:02:45.170> from<00:02:45.440> here<00:02:45.709> like<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> pitcher<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
pour right from here like a pitcher so

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.699 
pour right from here like a pitcher so
either<00:02:47.390> way<00:02:47.629> it's<00:02:47.930> got<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.079> couple<00:02:48.410> different

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
either way it's got a couple different

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.059 
either way it's got a couple different
ways<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:49.190> operate<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.569> whole<00:02:50.900> setup<00:02:51.500> pretty

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
ways to operate this whole setup pretty

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.190 
ways to operate this whole setup pretty
cool<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.670> let's<00:02:52.879> get<00:02:53.299> up<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.629> kitchen<00:02:54.019> and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
cool so let's get up to the kitchen and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.710 
cool so let's get up to the kitchen and
find<00:02:54.799> out<00:02:55.010> exactly<00:02:55.700> how<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.150> thing<00:02:56.480> works

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
find out exactly how this thing works

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.599 
find out exactly how this thing works
and<00:02:56.930> how<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.079> water<00:02:57.379> tastes<00:02:57.890> when<00:02:58.340> we're<00:02:58.489> all

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
and how the water tastes when we're all

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.410 
and how the water tastes when we're all
finished<00:03:00.400> all<00:03:01.400> right<00:03:01.549> before<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:01.970> get<00:03:02.120> out<00:03:02.269> to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
finished all right before we get out to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.599 
finished all right before we get out to
actually<00:03:02.569> using<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.230> tygo<00:03:03.650> I've<00:03:04.069> got<00:03:04.280> some<00:03:04.519> of

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
actually using the tygo I've got some of

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.979 
actually using the tygo I've got some of
the<00:03:04.670> water<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:04.940> came<00:03:05.239> right<00:03:05.420> out<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.540> my<00:03:05.720> tap

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
the water that came right out of my tap

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.619 
the water that came right out of my tap
and<00:03:06.230> we're<00:03:06.319> gonna<00:03:06.410> perform<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.160> pH<00:03:07.940> test<00:03:08.329> on

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
and we're gonna perform the pH test on

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.930 
and we're gonna perform the pH test on
it<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.200> I've<00:03:09.319> got<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> solution<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
it so I've got the solution that the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.460 
it so I've got the solution that the
company<00:03:11.329> provided<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.049> I'm<00:03:12.109> going<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.319> put

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
company provided and I'm going to put

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.960 
company provided and I'm going to put
that<00:03:12.560> into<00:03:12.769> my<00:03:12.859> water<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.400> says<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:13.760> use<00:03:13.849> about

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
that into my water it says to use about

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.300 
that into my water it says to use about
two<00:03:14.269> drops<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:15.260> I'm<00:03:15.410> not<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> scientist<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.250> have

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
two drops and I'm not a scientist I have

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.619 
two drops and I'm not a scientist I have
no<00:03:16.459> idea<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:16.849> is<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.239> amount<00:03:17.359> or

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
no idea if this is the right amount or

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.150 
no idea if this is the right amount or
not<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.319> we're<00:03:18.440> going<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.620> leave<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.889> sit

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
not but we're going to leave this sit

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.309 
not but we're going to leave this sit
and<00:03:19.400> we'll<00:03:19.579> come<00:03:19.819> back<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.269> check<00:03:20.930> out<00:03:21.109> the

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
and we'll come back and check out the

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.770 
and we'll come back and check out the
color<00:03:21.739> comparison<00:03:22.280> chart<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.239> when

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
color comparison chart with that when

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780 
color comparison chart with that when
we're<00:03:23.959> all<00:03:24.109> done<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.829> we'll<00:03:25.040> also<00:03:25.190> compare<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
we're all done and we'll also compare it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.629 
we're all done and we'll also compare it
to<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.540> filtered<00:03:27.019> water<00:03:27.109> so<00:03:27.680> I've<00:03:28.160> had<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
to the filtered water so I've had the

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.930 
to the filtered water so I've had the
filter<00:03:29.269> in<00:03:29.870> water<00:03:30.709> for<00:03:31.040> over<00:03:31.430> five<00:03:31.669> minutes

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
filter in water for over five minutes

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.550 
filter in water for over five minutes
now<00:03:32.239> we're<00:03:32.840> going<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.019> put<00:03:33.169> it<00:03:33.260> all<00:03:33.410> back

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
now we're going to put it all back

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.990 
now we're going to put it all back
together<00:03:33.769> I'm<00:03:34.130> going<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.310> screw<00:03:34.579> this<00:03:34.609> back

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
together I'm going to screw this back

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.110 
together I'm going to screw this back
into<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.720> toggle<00:03:36.680> or<00:03:36.919> reservoir<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:38.000> then

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
into the toggle or reservoir and then

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.809 
into the toggle or reservoir and then
take<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.599> cup<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.620> put<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.130> on<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.579> top

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
take the cup and put it on to the top

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.379 
take the cup and put it on to the top
like<00:03:41.090> so

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
like so

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.210 
like so
now<00:03:42.109> essentially<00:03:42.560> all<00:03:42.709> we<00:03:42.799> have<00:03:42.889> to<00:03:42.980> do<00:03:43.099> is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
now essentially all we have to do is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.339 
now essentially all we have to do is
fill<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.669> thing<00:03:43.730> up<00:03:44.060> with<00:03:44.569> our<00:03:44.720> regular<00:03:45.079> tap

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
fill this thing up with our regular tap

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.770 
fill this thing up with our regular tap
water<00:03:45.400> once<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.549> get<00:03:46.669> kind<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.180> right<00:03:47.389> at<00:03:47.419> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
water once we get kind of right at the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.870 
water once we get kind of right at the
top<00:03:48.019> we're<00:03:48.859> just<00:03:48.980> going<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.190> leave<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.340> be

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
top we're just going to leave it be

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.960 
top we're just going to leave it be
and<00:03:49.970> let<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.690> water<00:03:50.930> filter<00:03:51.799> down<00:03:52.010> into<00:03:52.370> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
and let the water filter down into the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.870 
and let the water filter down into the
reservoir<00:03:53.150> like<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:53.989> after<00:03:54.739> it's<00:03:54.919> full<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.669> can

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
reservoir like so after it's full I can

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.330 
reservoir like so after it's full I can
to<00:03:56.000> redo<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.750> looks<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:57.319> not<00:03:57.590> one<00:03:57.919> cup<00:03:58.190> is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
to redo it it looks like not one cup is

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.860 
to redo it it looks like not one cup is
going<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.549> fill<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.879> whole<00:03:59.000> thing<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.720> can

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
going to fill the whole thing you can

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.119 
going to fill the whole thing you can
see<00:04:00.019> though<00:04:00.169> that<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.440> goes<00:04:00.590> through<00:04:00.650> pretty

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
see though that it goes through pretty

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.039 
see though that it goes through pretty
quickly<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:02.090> one<00:04:02.239> thing<00:04:02.419> about<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.750> pitcher

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
quickly the one thing about the pitcher

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.180 
quickly the one thing about the pitcher
that<00:04:03.169> I<00:04:03.230> mentioned<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.709> we<00:04:03.799> have<00:04:03.950> in<00:04:04.069> our

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
that I mentioned that we have in our

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.009 
that I mentioned that we have in our
beach<00:04:04.400> house<00:04:04.609> is<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.329> does<00:04:05.510> seem<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.810> take<00:04:05.989> a

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
beach house is it does seem to take a

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.020 
beach house is it does seem to take a
long<00:04:06.230> time<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.739> filter<00:04:07.069> through<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.819> is

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
long time to filter through this is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.909 
long time to filter through this is
going<00:04:08.329> remarkably<00:04:08.840> fast<00:04:09.139> I<00:04:09.410> can<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.739> that

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
going remarkably fast I can see that

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.009 
going remarkably fast I can see that
this<00:04:10.160> whole<00:04:10.400> reservoir<00:04:11.329> probably<00:04:11.780> will<00:04:11.900> only

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
this whole reservoir probably will only

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.619 
this whole reservoir probably will only
take<00:04:12.349> two<00:04:13.040> minutes<00:04:13.430> or<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.849> completely

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
take two minutes or so to completely

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.740 
take two minutes or so to completely
filter<00:04:15.530> into<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.130> reservoir<00:04:16.940> at<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.299> bottom

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
filter into the reservoir at the bottom

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.569 
filter into the reservoir at the bottom
so<00:04:17.989> let's<00:04:18.530> finish<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:18.889> up<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.340> we'll<00:04:19.459> be

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
so let's finish that up and we'll be

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:33.080 
so let's finish that up and we'll be
right<00:04:19.729> back

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.520 

all<00:04:34.090> right<00:04:34.240> it's<00:04:34.390> just<00:04:34.630> about<00:04:34.810> done<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.140> what

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
all right it's just about done so what

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.590 
all right it's just about done so what
I'm<00:04:35.650> gonna<00:04:35.770> do<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.220> remove<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.940> cap<00:04:37.270> from<00:04:37.510> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
I'm gonna do is remove this cap from the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.380 
I'm gonna do is remove this cap from the
top<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:39.100> can<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.670> know<00:04:39.760> set<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.060> aside<00:04:40.180> for

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
top and we can you know set it aside for

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.930 
top and we can you know set it aside for
later<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.140> then<00:04:41.500> replace<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.250> bottle<00:04:42.670> here

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
later and then replace the bottle here

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.810 
later and then replace the bottle here
with<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.900> guess<00:04:44.350> we'll<00:04:44.500> call<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.830> other<00:04:45.340> cap

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
with the I guess we'll call it other cap

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.360 
with the I guess we'll call it other cap
so<00:04:46.420> now<00:04:46.870> what<00:04:47.140> I've<00:04:47.230> got<00:04:47.260> is<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:48.100> guess

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
so now what I've got is a I guess

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.520 
so now what I've got is a I guess
watertight<00:04:49.030> bottle<00:04:49.780> that's<00:04:50.080> completely

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
watertight bottle that's completely

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.050 
watertight bottle that's completely
filtered<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.280> can<00:04:51.400> see<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.670> water<00:04:51.850> down

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
filtered you can see the water down

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.480 
filtered you can see the water down
below<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.600> completely<00:04:53.110> clear<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:54.160> have<00:04:54.190> the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
below is completely clear and I have the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.670 
below is completely clear and I have the
cap<00:04:54.670> all<00:04:54.970> in<00:04:55.120> place<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.840> can<00:04:56.230> turn<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.560> off

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
cap all in place so I can turn it off

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.110 
cap all in place so I can turn it off
and<00:04:56.710> there's<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> little<00:04:57.610> bit<00:04:57.730> water<00:04:57.850> on<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
and there's a little bit water on the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.990 
and there's a little bit water on the
top<00:04:58.330> but<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.900> shouldn't<00:04:59.320> leak<00:04:59.530> very<00:04:59.860> much<00:05:00.130> so

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
top but it shouldn't leak very much so

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.180 
top but it shouldn't leak very much so
now<00:05:01.300> let's<00:05:01.780> pour<00:05:02.200> some<00:05:02.230> of<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.680> filtered

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
now let's pour some of this filtered

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.250 
now let's pour some of this filtered
water<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.550> have<00:05:03.760> another<00:05:04.000> glass<00:05:04.300> over<00:05:04.630> here<00:05:04.660> so

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
water I have another glass over here so

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.990 
water I have another glass over here so
I'm<00:05:05.350> just<00:05:05.440> gonna<00:05:05.530> bring<00:05:05.800> those<00:05:06.070> in<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.880> we'll

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
I'm just gonna bring those in and we'll

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.140 
I'm just gonna bring those in and we'll
pour<00:05:07.180> some<00:05:07.390> of<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.630> into<00:05:08.200> my<00:05:08.830> empty<00:05:09.340> glass<00:05:09.790> here

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
pour some of it into my empty glass here

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.790 
pour some of it into my empty glass here
and<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.390> can<00:05:10.510> see<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:11.290> does<00:05:11.560> have<00:05:11.770> a

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
and you can see that this does have a

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.940 
and you can see that this does have a
pour<00:05:12.700> spout<00:05:12.730> on<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.240> top<00:05:13.480> which<00:05:14.230> I'll<00:05:14.560> put<00:05:14.830> in

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
pour spout on the top which I'll put in

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.340 
pour spout on the top which I'll put in
there<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.310> side<00:05:16.090> by<00:05:16.240> side<00:05:16.480> I<00:05:16.750> can<00:05:17.020> see<00:05:17.230> right

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
there and side by side I can see right

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.810 
there and side by side I can see right
away<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.890> filtered<00:05:18.310> water<00:05:18.340> is<00:05:18.640> much

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
away that the filtered water is much

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.640 
away that the filtered water is much
clearer<00:05:19.150> already<00:05:19.570> we<00:05:19.990> haven't<00:05:20.110> done<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.410> test

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
clearer already we haven't done the test

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.530 
clearer already we haven't done the test
yet<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.010> let's<00:05:21.190> do<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.400> right<00:05:21.730> now<00:05:21.910> I'm<00:05:22.180> going

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
yet so let's do that right now I'm going

to<00:05:22.630> put<00:05:22.780> some<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.350> pH<00:05:23.740> drops<00:05:24.040> into<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.610> to

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
to put some of the pH drops into that to

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.600 
to put some of the pH drops into that to
see<00:05:25.360> if<00:05:25.390> there's<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.690> difference<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:27.460> you<00:05:27.490> can

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
see if there's a difference so you can

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.970 
see if there's a difference so you can
see<00:05:27.910> right<00:05:28.030> away<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.330> color<00:05:28.980> immediately

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
see right away the color immediately

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.820 
see right away the color immediately
change<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.970> let's<00:05:31.780> get<00:05:31.960> out<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.260> color<00:05:32.530> chart

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830

change and let's get out the color chart
and<00:05:33.160> you<00:05:33.910> can<00:05:33.970> see<00:05:34.300> how<00:05:34.480> alkaline<00:05:35.170> the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
and you can see how alkaline the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.890 
and you can see how alkaline the
filtered<00:05:36.430> water<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:37.030> which<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.420> a<00:05:37.450> good<00:05:37.690> thing

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
filtered water is which is a good thing

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
and looks like my tap water was a little

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.480 
and looks like my tap water was a little
acidic<00:05:44.140> not<00:05:44.380> too<00:05:44.560> bad<00:05:44.770> though<00:05:44.980> when<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:45.160> look<00:05:45.370> at

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
acidic not too bad though when I look at

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.250 
acidic not too bad though when I look at
the<00:05:45.580> color<00:05:45.790> but<00:05:46.420> wow<00:05:46.570> look<00:05:46.930> how<00:05:47.050> that
