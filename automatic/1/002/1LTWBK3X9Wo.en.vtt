00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
here you've got a camera I believe this

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
here you've got a camera I believe this
is<00:01:02.070> 5<00:01:02.280> megapixels<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> front

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is 5 megapixels and here on the front

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
is 5 megapixels and here on the front
you've<00:01:03.989> got<00:01:04.110> another<00:01:04.350> camera<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.280> that's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you've got another camera I think that's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
you've got another camera I think that's
2<00:01:05.670> megapixels<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.229> feels<00:01:07.619> really

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
2 megapixels so actually feels really

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740

software front you got honeycomb 3.1

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.999 
software front you got honeycomb 3.1
feels<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.759> sort<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> smooth<00:01:25.200> no<00:01:25.680> real

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
feels really sort of smooth no real

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
feels really sort of smooth no real
customizations<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> actual<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.860> show

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.719 
customizations to the actual you I show
you<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:30.799> but<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.159> oh<00:01:32.250> she<00:01:32.490> was

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you that there but so what oh she was

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.730 
you that there but so what oh she was
really<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> I'm<00:01:33.990> preloading<00:01:34.530> some

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really doing here is I'm preloading some

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.590 
really doing here is I'm preloading some
new<00:01:34.890> apps<00:01:35.100> they've<00:01:35.670> redone<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> file<00:01:36.390> manager

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
new apps they've redone the file manager

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.859 
new apps they've redone the file manager
here<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.040> sort<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> makes<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> easier<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.390> get

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
here so sort of makes it easier to get

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.929 
here so sort of makes it easier to get
to<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.110> files<00:01:40.409> should<00:01:41.340> also<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.790> easier

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to your files should also make it easier

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
to your files should also make it easier
to<00:01:42.119> sideload<00:01:42.630> things<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> plug<00:01:43.409> things

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to sideload things when you plug things

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
to sideload things when you plug things
in<00:01:43.860> through<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> USB<00:01:44.460> you've<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.630> new

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
in through the USB you've got this new

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
in through the USB you've got this new
app<00:01:46.020> place<00:01:46.409> market<00:01:47.340> which<00:01:47.939> seems<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
app place market which seems to have a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
app place market which seems to have a
hard<00:01:48.869> time<00:01:49.020> loading<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.649> time<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.159> let<00:01:50.280> me<00:01:50.340> see

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
hard time loading at time so let me see

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.580 
hard time loading at time so let me see
if<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.670> back<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:54.590> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
if I back out of there I think it it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.220 
if I back out of there I think it it
usually<00:01:55.939> pops<00:01:56.939> back<00:01:57.149> up

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.000 

alright<00:02:00.230> that<00:02:00.380> doesn't<00:02:00.680> seem<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.920> be<00:02:00.980> working

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
alright that doesn't seem to be working

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.190 
alright that doesn't seem to be working
right<00:02:01.430> now<00:02:01.460> you've<00:02:02.300> got<00:02:02.420> their<00:02:02.600> start<00:02:02.960> place

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
right now you've got their start place

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.400 
right now you've got their start place

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
formatting which is pretty nice and you

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.650 
formatting which is pretty nice and you
can<00:02:20.800> zoom<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:23.120> all<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.300> sort<00:02:23.630> of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
can zoom in and do all that sort of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.580 
can zoom in and do all that sort of
fancy<00:02:23.870> stuff<00:02:24.320> see<00:02:24.980> if<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.250> was<00:02:25.400> working<00:02:25.610> now

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
fancy stuff see if this was working now

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.350 
fancy stuff see if this was working now
there<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.680> go<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> place<00:02:28.610> actually<00:02:28.970> loaded<00:02:29.300> I

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
there we go so a place actually loaded I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.940 
there we go so a place actually loaded I
think<00:02:29.540> there's<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.050> little<00:02:30.260> bit<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.770> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
think there's just a little bit of a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.949 
think there's just a little bit of a
delay<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:31.670> they've<00:02:32.180> packaged<00:02:32.720> some<00:02:32.870> of

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
delay there so they've packaged some of

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.290 
delay there so they've packaged some of
their<00:02:33.080> own<00:02:33.350> apps<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.700> sort<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.180> are

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
their own apps here and sort of are

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.790 
their own apps here and sort of are
making<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.660> easier<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.020> find<00:02:36.200> tablet<00:02:36.650> apps

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
making it easier to find tablet apps

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.590 
making it easier to find tablet apps
which<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.130> actually<00:02:37.430> really<00:02:37.610> nice<00:02:37.850> since<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
which is actually really nice since the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.030 
which is actually really nice since the
market<00:02:38.930> at<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.200> point<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.560> pretty<00:02:39.770> hard<00:02:39.950> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
market at this point is pretty hard to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
market at this point is pretty hard to
find<00:02:40.310> tablet<00:02:40.700> apps<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.810> that's<00:02:41.989> just<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.230> look

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
find tablet apps so that's just a look

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.280 
find tablet apps so that's just a look
here<00:02:42.620> at<00:02:42.770> some<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> software
