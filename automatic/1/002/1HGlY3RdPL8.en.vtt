00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.790
 Once in vincennes I came to the cinema with my 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.280
 family 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.650
 we are here we are going to see a movie of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.990
 the truth and I know we're going to do and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 also people and today I was going to record a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.340
 video but the truth is that I did not have 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.750
 time or good I wanted to record the video 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.160
 but it was just like we're going to do 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.060
 more options as they did not ask us for two 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.060
 matters that give you bad 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.050
 today but strange thing proposed 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.950
 nervous with the agent seen 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.950
 so 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.269
 we are walking to enter and that is 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.370
 the oldest cinema there is but good is 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.230
 that this is the master is easier 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
 There are several 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.460
 something not the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.460
