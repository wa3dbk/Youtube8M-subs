00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.849
 hello and welcome to this show is tracked or again 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.999
 with our friend the philosopher alexi masson and well we will think 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.980
 together on an idea and we will try to unpack it together 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.329
 precisely this received idea and we will talk today about prayer 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.339
 then to prayer 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.769
 does it really have any utility we will wonder about it and so 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.260
 it is true that if we postulate a god who is all powerful a god who is good and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 well this god anyway from yesterday he wants to do the sunny good 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.760
 why prayer from that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600
 as for her at all times recipe quite problem that arose 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.630
 to socrates in the first the second not so well say 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.320
 in 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 this this dialogue socrates also clearly the question 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.420
 that is, if god actually is a dual who is good and who is 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.250
 almighty staercke he wants to do good and he can do it because he is 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.430
 all powerful 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.900
 well in this case, of course, he will accomplish the good 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.290
 and from the net blow prayer it's useless if they took for things that 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.290
 are good it is useless since anyway cold milk 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.160
 and if they took for things that are bad luckily that god does not 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.520
 do not answer our prayers because I can not say that god does 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.090
 bullshit because we ask him 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 but this is a problem that his practice is experiencing is immense and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.400
 it's delicate 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.060
 so that means that 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 according to socrates the prayer on the bad 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.470
 nanterre socrates still offers a solution is a response to the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.180
 liquidity of prayer 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.350
 must who by the way is very close to Christianity the father that socrates 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.820
 proposes the following thing that is to say that prayer is the bouquet this 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.950
 consistory asked to combine 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.230
 for what he has accomplished his own will he completes that is to say 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.620
 Lord I pray that the good his accomplice 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.710
 he approached Christianity in this sense in the eighteenth already gives a model of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.999
 prayers to his disciples 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.850
 waiting for the famous there the famous prayer of our father 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429
 ogilvy 10% and 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.189
 it loses your will be done and here and there on earth as in heaven as 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.370
 in heaven body finally start locomotion 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.980
 so in here we have a case the word resignation of the problem is a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.569
 Lord does our will 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.499
 so for good it does not mean necessarily repeated the will but 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.339
 obviously it was not voluntary 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.139
 for that not to say that it stops 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.969
 here is a general prayer it is not necessarily it comes 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.709
 this is a point but it follows precisely 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.409
 as does not believe his strike what will be said we must stop just 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:31.859
 the 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.339
 but in Christianity we still have the idea that 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.209
 the plan of the very precise cases one can know more or less what of the past 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.859
 at that moment and so we can pray for 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:40.910
 and then especially 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.700
 % as it is written in Roman obvious if this god can sometimes we 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.910
 inspire which subject% and prayer 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.839
 what is needed for 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.849
 the end why praying at that time but that is saying that 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.999
 although we often ignore the good sometimes hard to inspire us 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.949
 that's why we have to pray they can pray for it 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.199
 and suddenly that if god knows 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.439
 and I want what's good so that's the simple bazin posture 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.849
 What is the point of praying in what could our prayer 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.019
 influence things now it's true that good prayer can not 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.679
 influence of god 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:19.529
 from a positive point of view yesterday that prayer does not push had to act this is 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:20.809
 because we ask god 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.409
 to do this the good that will do good our god is not an order 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.289
 given by our services 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.509
 on the other hand percent and there is something that could be considered more 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.599
 it could be a negative influence in that the fact of not 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.749
 not pray 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.599
 to encourage God not to act 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.419
 so I explain why 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.999
 e because it reflects prayer is a sign of worship and is a sign 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.389
 finally politeness 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.779
 of respect for god and trust in god is a bit like a 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.799
 child for example evening 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.799
 and he refuses asked his father 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.899
 the father I want the other a daddy I want water oscillates black 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.699
 alas often dads waiting for France does not say please she 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.510
 is worthy have brought questionable 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.399
 because it's normal torrent served 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.819
 normal that to attack tulle shows me an act of respect to an act of 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.719
 politeness by asking please 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.610
 and it would be m 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.439
 bad 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.090
 of data the glass of water to the child without them dissipating because 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.690
 that basically I will not be encouraging him to politeness and the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.299
 respect for things 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.919
 Well, it's the same with God if you do not ask Lord that your will 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.340
 be complete under his mother that you do good somehow like 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.419
 oliver designer must well their cracks and then here is my sound we are 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.770
 balance content so it's a sign of respect that's why percent 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.300
 pray an influence not god it's true 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.539
 % instead do not pray that the outstanding ax not to do what has the 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.699
 was planning to do because it would be even worse because that 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.599
 encourages us to be beautiful and be it is pure airbus agree for the 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.190
 pray a manifesto 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.580
 trust and respect as we have for god what exactly the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.190
 same thing 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.240
 in the last selection for enlightening us on this issue 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.150
 2 the prayer
