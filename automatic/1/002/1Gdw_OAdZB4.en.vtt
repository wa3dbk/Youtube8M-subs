00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and no that was pretty much the end it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
and no that was pretty much the end it
seemed<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.950> could<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.729> been<00:01:29.790> more

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
seemed like there could have been more

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
seemed like there could have been more
to<00:01:30.509> explain<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.490 
there was some other little things that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
are worth mentioning like at the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.780 
are worth mentioning like at the
beginning<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> chapter<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.400> mission<00:01:35.670> at

week<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.170> hoping<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.009> battle

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
week I was hoping that the the battle

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.770 
week I was hoping that the the battle
would<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.520> little<00:02:09.670> more<00:02:09.820> entertaining<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.570> do

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
would be a little more entertaining I do

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.530 
would be a little more entertaining I do
think<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.200> it's<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:12.580> funny<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.000> when

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
think that it's really funny that when

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.180 
think that it's really funny that when
Kenpachi<00:02:13.990> has<00:02:14.200> finally<00:02:14.530> come<00:02:14.680> back<00:02:14.860> after<00:02:15.160> all

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
Kenpachi has finally come back after all

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.770 
Kenpachi has finally come back after all
of<00:02:15.430> his<00:02:15.580> training<00:02:15.880> he's<00:02:16.180> gotten<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.660> these

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
of his training he's gotten all these

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.260 
of his training he's gotten all these
new<00:02:16.930> powers<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.500> everything<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.130> he's<00:02:18.910> going

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
new powers and everything and he's going

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.620 
new powers and everything and he's going
to<00:02:19.480> test<00:02:19.720> them<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:20.080> by<00:02:20.680> murdering<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.400> child

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to test them out by murdering a child

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.850 
to test them out by murdering a child
and<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.290> really<00:02:23.590> dark

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and I just think that's a really dark

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.440 
and I just think that's a really dark
and<00:02:24.070> maybe<00:02:24.610> there<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.090> bit<00:02:25.240> more<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and maybe there is a little bit more to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.990 
and maybe there is a little bit more to
this<00:02:25.630> Gremmie<00:02:25.990> kid<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:27.160> fact<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.580> he

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
this Gremmie kid like the fact that he

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.900 
this Gremmie kid like the fact that he
can<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:28.720> mold<00:02:29.020> his<00:02:29.400> imagination<00:02:30.400> into<00:02:30.730> what

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
can like mold his imagination into what

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.420 
can like mold his imagination into what
he<00:02:30.970> wants<00:02:31.300> maybe<00:02:32.290> he<00:02:32.530> actually<00:02:32.740> isn't<00:02:33.070> even<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
he wants maybe he actually isn't even a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.830 
he wants maybe he actually isn't even a
kid<00:02:33.610> at<00:02:33.730> all<00:02:33.790> maybe<00:02:34.060> he's<00:02:34.270> just<00:02:34.390> making

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
kid at all maybe he's just making

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.260 
kid at all maybe he's just making
himself<00:02:35.020> look<00:02:35.350> young<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.100> order<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.640> fool<00:02:37.030> his

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
himself look young in order to fool his

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.030 
himself look young in order to fool his
opponents<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.930> maybe<00:02:38.140> he<00:02:38.350> has<00:02:38.530> an<00:02:38.680> entirely

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
opponents and maybe he has an entirely

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.070 
opponents and maybe he has an entirely
different<00:02:39.489> form<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.020> to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
different form and this is just going to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.690 
different form and this is just going to
be<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.230> way<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> trick<00:02:41.709> him<00:02:41.920> pachi<00:02:42.130> but<00:02:42.489> it

be a way to trick him pachi but it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.250 
be a way to trick him pachi but it
doesn't<00:02:42.970> seem<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.330> affecting<00:02:43.840> him<00:02:43.930> at<00:02:44.080> all

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
doesn't seem to be affecting him at all

one<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.600> fight<00:02:52.780> against<00:02:53.050> them<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.350> there's

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
one to fight against them and there's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.050 
one to fight against them and there's
still<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.920> possibility<00:02:54.070> they<00:02:54.700> could<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:54.910> like

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
still the possibility they could do like

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.850 
still the possibility they could do like
a<00:02:55.120> little<00:02:55.360> tag<00:02:55.570> out<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.050> she<00:02:56.380> could<00:02:56.530> come<00:02:56.680> in

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
a little tag out and she could come in

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.229 
a little tag out and she could come in
and<00:02:56.980> help<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.280> battle<00:02:57.459> because<00:02:57.880> nothing

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
and help in the battle because nothing

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.690 
and help in the battle because nothing
has<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.390> started<00:02:59.170> yet<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.650> we've<00:03:00.370> always

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
has really started yet and we've always

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.850 
has really started yet and we've always
seen<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.300> past<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.810> Kenpachi<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.500> bored

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
seen in the past if Kenpachi is bored

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.710 
seen in the past if Kenpachi is bored
with<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> battle<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.489> he<00:03:03.550> doesn't<00:03:03.880> enjoy<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.269> he

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720

with a battle and he doesn't enjoy it he
just<00:03:04.870> walks<00:03:05.200> away<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.830> he<00:03:05.890> doesn't<00:03:06.160> even<00:03:06.250> like

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
just walks away and he doesn't even like

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.280 
just walks away and he doesn't even like
think<00:03:06.730> about<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.300> he<00:03:07.450> might<00:03:07.630> pass<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290
