says<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.520> pooh-pooh<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:39.119> how<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
says don't pooh-pooh see how that's so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.440 
says don't pooh-pooh see how that's so
funny<00:01:40.290> no<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.220> anyway<00:01:41.430> let's<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.150> back<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
funny no but anyway let's go back to the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
funny no but anyway let's go back to the
pm-9<00:01:42.810> p.m.<00:01:43.159> 9<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.460> an<00:01:44.820> amazing<00:01:45.299> amazing

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
pm-9 p.m. 9 is an amazing amazing

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.200 
pm-9 p.m. 9 is an amazing amazing
submachine<00:01:46.170> gun<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.579> understand<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
submachine gun we all do understand that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.960 
submachine gun we all do understand that
this<00:01:48.540> gun<00:01:48.990> has<00:01:49.020> massive<00:01:49.890> recoil<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.790> very

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this gun has massive recoil it is very

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
this gun has massive recoil it is very
very<00:01:51.119> difficult<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.899> aim<00:01:52.140> down<00:01:52.290> sight<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.009> not

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
very difficult to aim down sight and not

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.920 
very difficult to aim down sight and not
have<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:53.939> gun<00:01:54.030> fly<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.479> over<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.780> place

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
have your gun fly all over the place

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.510 
have your gun fly all over the place
that's<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.439> why<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:55.619> using<00:01:55.770> an<00:01:55.979> MP<00:01:56.340> nine

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's actually why I'm using an MP nine

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.300 
that's actually why I'm using an MP nine
secondary<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.689> situations<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.649> but

and probably in an intervention in it

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.210

wait<00:02:16.900> yeah<00:02:17.110> that's<00:02:17.319> no<00:02:17.530> that's<00:02:17.799> not<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.099> it's

called it's not called intervention you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.149 
called it's not called intervention you
know<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.110> map<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.530> bridge<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:20.829> wow<00:02:21.129> i

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
know the map of the bridge that wow i

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.039 
know the map of the bridge that wow i
can't<00:02:21.549> believe<00:02:21.610> i<00:02:21.909> can<00:02:21.970> remember<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.480> but

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
can't believe i can remember this but

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.110 
can't believe i can remember this but
yes<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.409> map<00:02:23.799> right<00:02:24.040> there<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.879> map<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
yes that map right there is the map that

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.830 
yes that map right there is the map that
you<00:02:25.659> can't<00:02:26.349> really<00:02:26.470> use<00:02:27.659> interchange<00:02:28.659> wow

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you can't really use interchange wow

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.250 
you can't really use interchange wow
that<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.860> can't<00:02:30.069> use<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.909> gun<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.780> but

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
that you can't use a gun like this but

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.020 
that you can't use a gun like this but
on<00:02:32.590> maps<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.099> this<00:02:33.280> where<00:02:33.489> it's<00:02:33.579> very<00:02:33.760> close

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
on maps like this where it's very close

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.300 
on maps like this where it's very close
quarters<00:02:34.480> I'd<00:02:34.870> say<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.319> pm-9<00:02:35.739> with<00:02:35.980> extreme

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
quarters I'd say the pm-9 with extreme

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.729 
quarters I'd say the pm-9 with extreme
max<00:02:36.519> rapid<00:02:36.849> fire<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.150> probably<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:38.470> best

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
max rapid fire is probably the best

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.009 
max rapid fire is probably the best
close<00:02:39.010> quarters<00:02:39.370> gun<00:02:39.579> in<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:39.970> game<00:02:40.180> no<00:02:40.750> doubt

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
close quarters gun in this game no doubt

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.319 
close quarters gun in this game no doubt
a<00:02:41.439> I<00:02:41.470> think<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.310> shoots<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.700> fastest<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.269> it

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
a I think it shoots the fastest and it

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.020 
a I think it shoots the fastest and it
kills<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.689> fastest<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.609> if<00:02:45.609> you<00:02:45.760> only<00:02:45.879> hit

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
kills the fastest and if you only hit

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.430 
kills the fastest and if you only hit
fired<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.480> steady<00:02:46.690> aim<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.170> you're<00:02:47.319> gonna

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
fired with steady aim then you're gonna

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.199 
fired with steady aim then you're gonna
have<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> good<00:02:47.769> time<00:02:47.829> it's<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.730> hundred<00:02:49.090> percent

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
have a good time it's a hundred percent

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.930 
have a good time it's a hundred percent
true<00:02:49.599> so<00:02:50.200> that's<00:02:50.379> why<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> recommend<00:02:50.920> using<00:02:51.609> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
true so that's why I recommend using the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.849 
true so that's why I recommend using the
PM<00:02:52.180> 9<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.629> close<00:02:52.900> quarters<00:02:53.230> situation<00:02:53.680> maps

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
PM 9 and close quarters situation maps

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.369 
PM 9 and close quarters situation maps
like<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.310> cuz<00:02:54.549> mp7<00:02:55.329> actually<00:02:55.870> doesn't<00:02:56.200> have

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
like this cuz mp7 actually doesn't have

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.759 
like this cuz mp7 actually doesn't have
that<00:02:56.530> fast<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.980> killer<00:02:57.190> time<00:02:58.019> lida<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.379> has

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
that fast of a killer time lida it has

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.319 
that fast of a killer time lida it has
very<00:03:00.010> little<00:03:00.189> recoil<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.730> amazing<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.120> that

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
very little recoil it's amazing at that

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.509 
very little recoil it's amazing at that
at<00:03:01.930> long<00:03:02.139> range<00:03:02.470> stuff<00:03:02.739> but<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.280> close-range

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
at long range stuff but for close-range

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.420 
at long range stuff but for close-range
stuff<00:03:03.939> honestly<00:03:04.510> pm-9<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.709> way<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.889> go<00:03:06.099> so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
stuff honestly pm-9 is the way to go so

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.399 
stuff honestly pm-9 is the way to go so
I<00:03:06.459> think<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.450> perfect<00:03:07.629> p.m.<00:03:08.049> i'd<00:03:08.170> set

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
I think this is the perfect p.m. i'd set

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.440 
I think this is the perfect p.m. i'd set
up<00:03:08.530> extruder<00:03:09.159> mattox<00:03:09.430> rapid-fire<00:03:09.909> steady<00:03:10.269> aim

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
up extruder mattox rapid-fire steady aim

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.899 
up extruder mattox rapid-fire steady aim
and<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.500> specialist<00:03:12.220> i'd<00:03:12.370> say<00:03:12.609> just<00:03:12.639> because

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
and that specialist i'd say just because

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.670 
and that specialist i'd say just because
specialist<00:03:13.510> there's<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.139> lot<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.290> fun<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> do

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
specialist there's a lot of fun to do

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.960 
specialist there's a lot of fun to do
you<00:03:14.829> you<00:03:15.010> don't<00:03:15.040> have<00:03:15.159> to<00:03:15.280> use<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.579> obviously

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
you you don't have to use that obviously

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.520 
you you don't have to use that obviously
but<00:03:16.150> i<00:03:16.180> would<00:03:16.480> go<00:03:16.569> with<00:03:16.599> scavenger<00:03:17.139> since<00:03:17.379> it's

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
but i would go with scavenger since it's
