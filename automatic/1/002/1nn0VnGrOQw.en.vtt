00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.590

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560
 knead a little with our hands and already 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.530
 that we have advanced a little bit clearly 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.590
 with floured hands we are going to have a 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.650
 mass like the one that we have here that I already 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.120
 I started to go through our machine 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.180
 make pasta if you do not have machine 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.190

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.820

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.100
 It has simple steps 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.460
 and life being the thinnest 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.460
 possible 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.510

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.849
 the number three have to pass the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.760
