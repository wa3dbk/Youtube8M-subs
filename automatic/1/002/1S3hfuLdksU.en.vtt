your your general EQ section you've got

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.850 
your your general EQ section you've got
this<00:00:51.710> contour<00:00:52.340> control<00:00:53.210> just<00:00:53.420> here<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.530> with

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
this contour control just here so with

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.430 
this contour control just here so with
the<00:00:54.950> contour<00:00:55.370> control<00:00:55.760> in<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.440> twelve

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440

o'clock position and with the clean
volume<00:00:59.899> on<00:01:00.079> about<00:01:00.350> three<00:01:00.770> this<00:01:01.040> is<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.340> sound

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
volume on about three this is the sound

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:27.520 
volume on about three this is the sound
that<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.790> get

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.960 

you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.680> drive<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.040> clean<00:01:29.310> volume<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.730> a<00:01:29.820> bit

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you can drive that clean volume up a bit

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
you can drive that clean volume up a bit
if<00:01:30.120> you<00:01:30.480> want<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.690> louder<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.260> want<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
if you want it louder if you want the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.440 
if you want it louder if you want the
sound<00:01:31.620> to<00:01:31.770> start<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.550> breakup<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.120> get<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> bit

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
sound to start a breakup and get a bit

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:46.400 
sound to start a breakup and get a bit
crunch<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.260> main

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
crunch you can do on to the main

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.930 
crunch you can do on to the main
overdrive<00:01:46.860> channel<00:01:47.250> itself<00:01:47.490> i've<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
overdrive channel itself i've got the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.480 
overdrive channel itself i've got the
gain<00:01:48.150> on<00:01:48.180> half<00:01:48.660> contour<00:01:49.650> still<00:01:49.950> upright<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
gain on half contour still upright and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:20.530 
gain on half contour still upright and
you<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.210> this

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.910 

now<00:02:21.540> turning<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.140> gain<00:02:22.349> up<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.650> about

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
now turning the gain up to about

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
now turning the gain up to about
three-quarters<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.939> get<00:02:24.120> this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:58.620 

and<00:02:41.219> gain<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.390> full

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.710 

you

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.170 

I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
I

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
I
alright<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.360> hopefully<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.900> gives<00:03:04.930> an<00:03:05.140> idea

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
alright so hopefully that gives an idea

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.960 
alright so hopefully that gives an idea
of<00:03:05.410> how<00:03:05.560> much<00:03:05.680> gain<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> app<00:03:06.460> but<00:03:06.820> to

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
of how much gain is in the app but to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.730 
of how much gain is in the app but to
talk<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.420> about<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.690> contour<00:03:08.170> controls<00:03:08.590> I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
talk to you about the contour controls I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.260 
talk to you about the contour controls I
said<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.100> on<00:03:09.220> halfway<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.790> has<00:03:09.940> been<00:03:10.090> for

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
said it's on halfway and has been for

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.850 
said it's on halfway and has been for
the<00:03:10.360> whole<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:10.690> demo<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.470> what<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.740> does

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the whole of this demo and what it does

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.670 
the whole of this demo and what it does
is<00:03:12.040> pretty<00:03:12.280> much<00:03:12.570> do<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> pretty<00:03:14.080> broad<00:03:14.350> sweep

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
is pretty much do a pretty broad sweep

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.530 
is pretty much do a pretty broad sweep
of<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.920> mid<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.400> bring<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.210> all<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.330> way<00:03:16.510> down

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
of the mid so bring it all the way down

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.450 
of the mid so bring it all the way down
you<00:03:16.960> get<00:03:17.110> much<00:03:17.260> more<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.620> scooped<00:03:18.040> kind<00:03:18.340> of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
you get much more of a scooped kind of

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:29.610 
you get much more of a scooped kind of
sound

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.229 

on<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.040> other<00:03:31.159> end<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.519> scale<00:03:31.640> now<00:03:32.000> if<00:03:32.120> I

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
on the other end of the scale now if I

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.000 
on the other end of the scale now if I
take<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.569> contour<00:03:33.049> all<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.349> way<00:03:33.469> up<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.859> get

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
take the contour all the way up you get

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.740 
take the contour all the way up you get
much<00:03:34.219> more<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.609> traditional<00:03:34.790> martial<00:03:35.329> kind

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
much more of a traditional martial kind
