00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 Hello, I want to show you today 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:11.630
 how to tie can not quite 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.630
 quality hooks 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:21.749
 sometimes you buy hooks 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.269
 cheap they have here thats where the ear 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.900
 hook 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:32.990
 she's not very well done and this one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:39.420
 then strike romka cuts glitter on knot 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:42.360
 from unlike this hook where is this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.660
 hook he is normal ie edge 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.660
 here is tightly pressed to the forearm of the hook and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:02.370
 she doesn't cut the line on the knot and so 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.650
 of course we do it easier and better of course 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.100
 buy 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 hook hooks other higher quality 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 but also in this case when hooks you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.450
 substandard can get out of the situation 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 everything is very easy to do 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.750
 knit knot usual how and bind 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.750
 hook 3 turns is enough 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:41.060
 delays and excess fishing line is cut off 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.060
 right under the root 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.390
 this nodule will appear to be 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.190
 buffer such a gasket between the main 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:02:01.060
 our knot and eyelets hook that cuts 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:05.530
 fishing line and then fit the usual 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.530
 the main node with the main line 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.450
 we tighten the node we wet for reliability 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.200
 as I said this one this one 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.340
 nodule 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:34.269
 is such a kind of gasket 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:37.150
 between the ears and our main node 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:42.739
 thereby 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:47.269
 the primary node will never wipe this 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.079
 sharp tip of the ear but I hope in such 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.130
 a short lesson was something useful to you 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.130
 goodbye
