00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.460 
the only part i'm going to have bright
colors<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> i<00:01:05.610> don't<00:01:06.150> need<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.510> over<00:01:06.990> my

colors so i don't need to go all over my
lid<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> brow<00:01:08.490> bone<00:01:08.549> i<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.970> need<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> keep

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
lid to the brow bone i just need to keep

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.310 
lid to the brow bone i just need to keep
it<00:01:09.570> concentrated<00:01:11.030> down<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.140> you're

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it concentrated down here if you're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.750 
it concentrated down here if you're
going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.650> apply<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.250> my<00:01:14.430> crease

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
going to apply it is actually my crease

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.490 
going to apply it is actually my crease
color<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.479> i<00:01:15.600> find<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.990> having<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
color because i find that having a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.010 
color because i find that having a
crease<00:01:17.040> color<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.610> before<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.330> put<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.900> your

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
crease color on before you put on your

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.980 
crease color on before you put on your
bright<00:01:19.259> shadows<00:01:19.740> helps<00:01:20.549> keep<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> colors

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bright shadows helps keep the colors

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.649 
bright shadows helps keep the colors
muted<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.729> crazy<00:01:24.119> looking

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
muted so that it's not as crazy looking

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.120 
muted so that it's not as crazy looking
plus<00:01:24.990> i<00:01:25.170> definitely<00:01:25.680> don't<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> forget

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
plus i definitely don't want to forget

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.980 
plus i definitely don't want to forget
the<00:01:26.369> crease<00:01:26.580> color<00:01:26.820> because<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.330> tones

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the crease color because it just tones

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.569 
the crease color because it just tones
it<00:01:28.140> down<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.560> pulls<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> entire<00:01:29.369> look

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it down and pulls the entire look

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.819
