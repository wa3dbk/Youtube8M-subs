00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.639 
as dark as it was it was back in the day
but<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.539> true<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> original<00:00:49.110> box

but it's very true to the original box
and<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.129> that's<00:00:50.250> why<00:00:50.370> people<00:00:50.399> love<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and I think that's why people love the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.619 
and I think that's why people love the
shoe<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.230> much<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> box<00:00:53.629> yeah
