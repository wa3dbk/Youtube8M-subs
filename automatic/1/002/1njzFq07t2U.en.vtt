hi in this clip I'm going to show you
how<00:00:05.650> to<00:00:05.710> run<00:00:05.950> a<00:00:05.980> magic<00:00:06.460> xpa<00:00:06.910> application<00:00:07.660> on

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:07.779 
how to run a magic xpa application on

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.570 
how to run a magic xpa application on
the<00:00:07.870> Android<00:00:07.990> emulator<00:00:08.680> so<00:00:09.100> at<00:00:09.219> this<00:00:09.370> stage

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
the Android emulator so at this stage

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.919 
the Android emulator so at this stage
you<00:00:09.730> should<00:00:09.760> already<00:00:10.059> have<00:00:10.360> the<00:00:10.510> emulator

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:10.929 
you should already have the emulator

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.450 
you should already have the emulator
installed<00:00:11.110> on<00:00:11.650> your<00:00:11.740> computer<00:00:11.800> and<00:00:12.280> if<00:00:12.340> you

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
installed on your computer and if you

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.830 
installed on your computer and if you
don't<00:00:12.639> you<00:00:12.790> can<00:00:12.969> first<00:00:13.179> have<00:00:13.330> a<00:00:13.360> look<00:00:13.570> at<00:00:13.809> our

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
don't you can first have a look at our

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.019 
don't you can first have a look at our
clip<00:00:14.380> about<00:00:14.589> installing<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.190> emulator<00:00:15.610> so

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
clip about installing the emulator so

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.120 
clip about installing the emulator so
let's<00:00:16.240> begin<00:00:16.420> with<00:00:17.050> running<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.560> application

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
let's begin with running the application

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.639 
let's begin with running the application
on<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.279> server<00:00:18.419> so<00:00:19.419> to<00:00:19.480> do<00:00:19.779> this<00:00:20.020> you<00:00:20.470> need<00:00:20.590> a

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:20.649 
on the server so to do this you need a

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.440 
on the server so to do this you need a
rich<00:00:20.919> client<00:00:21.220> program<00:00:22.000> which<00:00:22.180> I've<00:00:22.329> already

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
rich client program which I've already

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.810 
rich client program which I've already
setup<00:00:22.930> here<00:00:23.290> hello<00:00:23.649> world<00:00:23.919> just<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.489> simple

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
setup here hello world just a simple

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.999 
setup here hello world just a simple
program<00:00:25.239> you<00:00:25.960> need<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.320> define<00:00:26.710> it<00:00:26.860> with<00:00:26.950> a

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
program you need to define it with a

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.859 
program you need to define it with a
public<00:00:27.430> name<00:00:27.640> so<00:00:27.910> here<00:00:28.090> we've<00:00:28.210> got<00:00:28.390> mobile

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
public name so here we've got mobile

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.019 
public name so here we've got mobile
program<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.520> need<00:00:30.669> to<00:00:30.759> have<00:00:30.880> the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
program and you need to have the

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.570 
program and you need to have the
external<00:00:31.360> checkbox<00:00:32.020> clicked<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:33.190> only<00:00:33.430> other

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
external checkbox clicked the only other

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.730 
external checkbox clicked the only other
thing<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:34.060> need<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.630> to<00:00:34.810> make<00:00:34.840> sure<00:00:35.020> that

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
thing that you need is to make sure that

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.170 
thing that you need is to make sure that
you've<00:00:35.980> got<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.190> setting<00:00:36.700> here<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.090> the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
you've got a setting here that the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.330 
you've got a setting here that the
deployment<00:00:37.780> mode<00:00:37.960> is<00:00:38.440> set<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.770> background

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
deployment mode is set to background

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.100 
deployment mode is set to background
which<00:00:39.490> we've<00:00:39.700> already<00:00:39.880> got<00:00:40.270> here<00:00:40.570> and<00:00:40.810> it<00:00:40.960> has

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
which we've already got here and it has

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.540 
which we've already got here and it has
to<00:00:41.290> run<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.680> background<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:42.220> that<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.430> can

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
to run in the background so that it can

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.610 
to run in the background so that it can
handle<00:00:42.760> requests<00:00:43.390> from<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.810> mobile<00:00:44.020> RIA

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
handle requests from the mobile RIA

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.920 
handle requests from the mobile RIA
client<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:46.329> we're<00:00:46.480> going<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.630> run<00:00:46.810> the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
client then we're going to run the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.750 
client then we're going to run the
application<00:00:47.500> on<00:00:47.620> MAGIX<00:00:48.010> server<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.730> can

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
application on MAGIX server and you can

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.730 
application on MAGIX server and you can
do<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.120> directly<00:00:49.300> by<00:00:49.810> starting<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.380> runtime

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
do it directly by starting the runtime

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.770 
do it directly by starting the runtime
engine<00:00:51.220> or<00:00:51.550> like<00:00:51.700> I'm<00:00:51.790> going<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.060> do<00:00:52.180> here<00:00:52.480> like

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
engine or like I'm going to do here like

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.250 
engine or like I'm going to do here like
icing<00:00:53.110> this<00:00:53.290> button<00:00:53.650> here<00:00:54.040> and<00:00:54.900> then<00:00:55.900> you<00:00:56.020> see

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
icing this button here and then you see

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.190 
icing this button here and then you see
that<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.860> application<00:00:57.040> is<00:00:57.900> executing<00:00:58.900> and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
that the application is executing and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.410 
that the application is executing and
then<00:01:00.130> you<00:01:00.489> just<00:01:00.700> go<00:01:00.820> ahead<00:01:00.970> here<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.329> the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
then you just go ahead here to the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.540 
then you just go ahead here to the
broker<00:01:01.600> icon<00:01:02.110> double-click<00:01:02.739> on<00:01:02.890> it<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.310> you

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
broker icon double-click on it and you

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.189 
broker icon double-click on it and you
can<00:01:03.730> see<00:01:03.970> that<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.239> application<00:01:04.869> is<00:01:05.019> running

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
can see that the application is running

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.500 
can see that the application is running
so<00:01:06.010> that's<00:01:06.190> what<00:01:06.370> we<00:01:06.460> need<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.760> do<00:01:06.940> in<00:01:07.300> the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
so that's what we need to do in the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.840 
so that's what we need to do in the
magic<00:01:07.840> xpa<00:01:08.260> studio<00:01:08.860> now<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.520> need<00:01:09.760> to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
magic xpa studio now you need to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.969 
magic xpa studio now you need to
configure<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.360> android<00:01:10.900> client<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.620> connect

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
configure the android client to connect

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.800 
configure the android client to connect
to<00:01:12.100> your<00:01:12.220> magic<00:01:12.610> server<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.300> this

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
to your magic server and this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.140 
to your magic server and this
configuration<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.770> can<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:15.280> either<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
configuration you can do either in the

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.840 
configuration you can do either in the
android<00:01:16.630> client<00:01:16.659> or<00:01:17.350> an<00:01:17.620> external<00:01:17.979> file<00:01:18.400> that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
android client or an external file that

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.460 
android client or an external file that
the<00:01:19.060> android<00:01:19.330> client<00:01:19.360> will<00:01:19.810> read<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.290> this

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
the android client will read and this

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.590 
the android client will read and this
sample<00:01:20.740> will<00:01:21.010> use<00:01:21.190> an<00:01:21.340> external<00:01:21.670> file<00:01:22.120> to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
sample will use an external file to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.120 
sample will use an external file to
store<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.990> connection<00:01:23.409> settings<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.040> this

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
store the connection settings and this

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.680 
store the connection settings and this
way<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.460> easier<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.909> change<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.330> settings

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
way it's easier to change the settings

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.360 
way it's easier to change the settings
without<00:01:25.960> having<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.409> rebuild<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.950> android

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
without having to rebuild the android

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.460 
without having to rebuild the android
client<00:01:27.640> each<00:01:27.850> time<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:29.200> make<00:01:29.320> things

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
client each time and to make things

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.200 
client each time and to make things
easier<00:01:29.860> we'll<00:01:29.979> just<00:01:30.159> use<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> sample<00:01:30.940> file

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
easier we'll just use a sample file

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.570 
easier we'll just use a sample file
which<00:01:31.659> you<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:31.840> find<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.799> folder<00:01:33.430> where

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
which you can find in the folder where

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.060 
which you can find in the folder where
you<00:01:33.700> installed<00:01:33.729> magic<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.900> just<00:01:35.380> look<00:01:35.890> for

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
you installed magic and just look for

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.070 
you installed magic and just look for
this<00:01:36.159> riyals<00:01:37.030> folder<00:01:37.479> we're<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.810> click

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
the web server and we need to make sure

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010 
the web server and we need to make sure
that<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.070> alias<00:02:17.490> name<00:02:17.520> magic<00:02:18.390> scripts<00:02:18.780> is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
that the alias name magic scripts is

that the alias name magic scripts is
actually<00:02:19.410> pointing<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> scripts<00:02:20.880> folder

folder<00:02:41.610> which<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.600> does<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.260> we're<00:02:43.410> good<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.740> go

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
folder which it does so we're good to go

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.220 
folder which it does so we're good to go

name which we had as hello world and the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.020 
name which we had as hello world and the
program<00:02:52.530> name<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:52.890> actually<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> public<00:02:53.850> name

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
program name is actually the public name

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.510 
program name is actually the public name
that<00:02:54.240> we<00:02:54.330> set<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.660> magic<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:56.130> had<00:02:56.280> called

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
that we set in magic and we had called

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.720 
that we set in magic and we had called
that<00:02:56.700> mobile<00:02:57.180> program<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.250> want<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.490> place

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that mobile program so we want to place

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.240 
that mobile program so we want to place
this<00:02:59.940> file<00:03:00.270> on<00:03:00.480> an<00:03:00.600> exposed<00:03:01.080> web<00:03:01.260> server<00:03:01.680> such

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
this file on an exposed web server such

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.520 
this file on an exposed web server such
as<00:03:02.430> magic<00:03:02.790> scripts<00:03:03.120> which<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.840> saw<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
as magic scripts which we just saw and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.380 
as magic scripts which we just saw and
it's<00:03:04.830> actually<00:03:05.160> best<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.610> create<00:03:05.730> an<00:03:05.970> alias

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
it's actually best to create an alias

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.479 
it's actually best to create an alias
that<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.720> specific<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.350> your<00:03:07.650> project<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that is specific for your project and

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.160 
that is specific for your project and
you<00:03:08.730> do<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.180> iis<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:10.050> right<00:03:10.110> now

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
you do that in iis but for right now

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.310 
you do that in iis but for right now
we'll<00:03:10.350> use<00:03:10.620> magic<00:03:10.830> scripts<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:13.110> we're<00:03:13.230> gonna

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
we'll use magic scripts so we're gonna

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.290 
we'll use magic scripts so we're gonna
save<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.860> file<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.209> scripts<00:03:15.600> folder

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
save this file to the scripts folder

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.910 
save this file to the scripts folder
which<00:03:18.300> we<00:03:18.480> saw<00:03:18.690> earlier<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.200> connected<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
which we saw earlier is connected to the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.270 
which we saw earlier is connected to the
magic<00:03:20.250> scripts<00:03:20.640> alias<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.950> go<00:03:23.070> ahead

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
magic scripts alias and just go ahead

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.070 
magic scripts alias and just go ahead
and<00:03:23.400> save<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.820> here<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:24.720> need<00:03:24.989> to

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
and save it here now we need to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.199 
and save it here now we need to
