the needle gets to the corner you might

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.889 
the needle gets to the corner you might
want<00:01:56.039> to<00:01:56.070> stop<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:57.210> sure<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> solid

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
want to stop and make sure the solid

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
line on the guide is still over the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
line on the guide is still over the
corner<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.869> isn't<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.319> sure<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.590> move<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
corner if it isn't be sure to move the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.389 
corner if it isn't be sure to move the
quilt<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.429> knock<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> guide

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.390 

this<00:02:08.399> makes<00:02:08.700> quilting<00:02:09.349> quick<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.709> easy<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
this makes quilting quick and easy and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.520 
this makes quilting quick and easy and
you<00:02:11.640> never<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.060> mark<00:02:12.420> or<00:02:12.599> erase<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.200> line

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you never have to mark or erase a line

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.850 
you never have to mark or erase a line
again<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:15.269> works<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.690> squares<00:02:16.049> up<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.620> four

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
again it works for squares up to four

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.880 
again it works for squares up to four
inches<00:02:17.250> big

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.280 

now<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.190> I'm<00:02:23.450> guiding<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.569> little<00:02:24.959> bit<00:02:25.110> off

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
now here I'm guiding it a little bit off

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.900 
now here I'm guiding it a little bit off
the<00:02:25.319> corner<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.160> I'm<00:02:26.310> allowing<00:02:26.549> for<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
the corner because I'm allowing for the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.470 
the corner because I'm allowing for the
seam<00:02:27.120> allowance<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:29.489> works<00:02:29.790> even<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.329> your

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
seam allowance this works even if your

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.910 
seam allowance this works even if your
squares<00:02:30.780> aren't<00:02:31.319> perfectly<00:02:31.799> square<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
squares aren't perfectly square and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
squares aren't perfectly square and
that's<00:02:34.920> how<00:02:35.099> easy<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:36.030> use<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.540> easy

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that's how easy it is to use the so easy
