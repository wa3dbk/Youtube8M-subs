00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hi here's a review of the state feed

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.200 
hi here's a review of the state feed
first<00:00:04.670> this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> safety<00:00:06.240> first<00:00:06.540> door<00:00:06.810> lock

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
first this is the safety first door lock

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.299 
first this is the safety first door lock
system<00:00:09.210> our<00:00:10.200> house<00:00:10.440> came<00:00:11.160> with<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:12.269> lever

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
system our house came with the lever

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.919 
system our house came with the lever
handles<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:15.000> see<00:00:15.210> most<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.599> houses<00:00:15.900> have

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
handles you do see most of houses have

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.740 
handles you do see most of houses have
the<00:00:16.260> regular<00:00:16.830> turn<00:00:17.070> handles<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:18.150> ours<00:00:18.449> comes

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the regular turn handles but ours comes

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320 
the regular turn handles but ours comes
with<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> came<00:00:19.500> with<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> levers<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.060> we

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
with a came with the levers and so we

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
with a came with the levers and so we
were<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.510> perplexed<00:00:22.199> those<00:00:22.619> two<00:00:22.920> what

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
were really perplexed those two what

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720 
were really perplexed those two what
we're<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> use<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.869> door<00:00:25.859> knob<00:00:26.070> safety

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
we're going to use for door knob safety

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.330 
we're going to use for door knob safety
systems<00:00:27.180> well<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.260> safety<00:00:28.500> first<00:00:28.890> one

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
systems well this is safety first one

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.110 
systems well this is safety first one
system<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.890> handled<00:00:31.890> doorknobs<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
system for handled doorknobs and and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.370 
system for handled doorknobs and and
it's<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.559> simple<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.160> install<00:00:36.140> we<00:00:37.140> had

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's very very simple to install we had

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.670 
it's very very simple to install we had
you<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> hardware<00:00:39.590> unscrew<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you had to take the hardware unscrew it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.010 
you had to take the hardware unscrew it
from<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.040> door<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.300> had<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.600> plates

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
from the door and it had these plates

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
from the door and it had these plates
than<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.250> want<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
than I really don't want to take this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
than I really don't want to take this
apart<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> together<00:00:46.469> but

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
apart because I have it together but

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.290 
apart because I have it together but
there's<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.579> plates<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> back

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
there's these little plates in the back

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
there's these little plates in the back
that<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.930> some<00:00:49.110> knockout<00:00:49.469> things<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that you just do some knockout things to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.819 
that you just do some knockout things to
line<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> screw<00:00:51.059> holes<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:52.050> took<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.649> less

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
line up the screw holes it took you less

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.889 
line up the screw holes it took you less
than<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.190> minute<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.610> figure<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.270> then

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
than a minute to figure that out then

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.660 
than a minute to figure that out then
you<00:00:54.960> put<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> plate<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you put that plate on there and that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
you put that plate on there and that
what<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.090> does<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> allows<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.289> stay

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
what that does is allows this don't stay

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.900 
what that does is allows this don't stay
locked<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.629> door<00:01:00.930> handle<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.910> then

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
locked in to be the door handle and then

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
locked in to be the door handle and then
once<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> screwed<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> handles<00:01:05.070> basically

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
once you screwed the handles basically

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
once you screwed the handles basically
back<00:01:05.790> together<00:01:06.000> you've<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.409> slight

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
back together you've got this slight

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.870 
back together you've got this slight
lock<00:01:09.049> that<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> skin<00:01:10.590> obviously<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.250> open<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
lock that the skin obviously is open and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
lock that the skin obviously is open and
this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> closed<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.470> does<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this is closed and what this does is it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
this is closed and what this does is it
doesn't<00:01:14.909> allow<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> handle<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.900> move<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
doesn't allow the handle to move and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.420 
doesn't allow the handle to move and
thus<00:01:17.689> keeps<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> children<00:01:19.320> away<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.920> this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
thus keeps the children away from this

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
thus keeps the children away from this
is<00:01:20.580> our<00:01:20.670> basement<00:01:20.850> door<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
is our basement door going down the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
is our basement door going down the
basement<00:01:22.080> stairs<00:01:22.439> anything<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
basement stairs anything like that and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.399 
basement stairs anything like that and
then<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:23.970> push<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.960> move<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
then you just push in on this move it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.310 
then you just push in on this move it
over<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> side<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.630> you've<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> open

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
over to the side and you've got it open

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.219 
over to the side and you've got it open
it<00:01:29.310> obviously<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.240> either<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.930> either

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it obviously can do either at either

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.219 
it obviously can do either at either
direction<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> install<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
direction so you install this it can the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
direction so you install this it can the
lever<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.710> go<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> either<00:01:35.070> direction<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
lever can go in either direction and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
lever can go in either direction and
it's<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.380> quality<00:01:37.950> product<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.320> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's just a very quality product and it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
it's just a very quality product and it
