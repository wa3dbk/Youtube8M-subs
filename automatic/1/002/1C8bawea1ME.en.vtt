00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.029
 points 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 today I will show you how to connect and be able 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.049
 use the xbox one controller 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 on your PC a very small premise 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.500
 before leaving 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 the controller does not work in mode 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.539
 wireless but only connected with the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.449
 usb cable and I wo n't need anything else 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.410
 to connect to the PC that the controller is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.180
 usb cable 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.180
 everything here we start with tutorials 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:40.050
 we are on the desktop 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 because to make the controller work 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 our xbox one we need 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 install some drivers yes driver 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.410
 find on this blog is a link 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.860
 you will find in the description and this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.660
 blog from major nelson and is a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.770
 blog to daughter for these microsoft 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.910
 this absolutely safe and microsoft 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.040
 stated that it will implement the drivers 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.350
 in a windows update in the future 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.050
 for now instead we have to install i 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 drivers from here we can make choose 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.759
 the architecture of our processor 32 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 bit or 64 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.000
 I have a 64-bit macias processor 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.100
 load this version and wait for the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.930
 download that is very fast because they are 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.320
 2.7 million 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.440
 open the installation we do execute 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.380
 next to you will appear the screen of 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 installation while I hours for the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.899
 fact that he already has this installed 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.429
 driver then the contribution will appear 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.539
 nothing you should obviously apply 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.450
 You expect the installation is over 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.340
 we click finish we have practically 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.789
 ended up with 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.130
 installing our controller 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.719
 on our pc 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.340
 once installed drivers on your 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:08.269
 in fact, pc will just need to take control 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.239
 and insert the usb cable 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.760
 I use a cable xd of the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.530
 sony but you can also use 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 the original one in fact I use this 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.410
 because it's a little shorter than that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.540
 original 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.060
 well the control will light up 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.239
 automatically and you will hear one 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.000
 vibration apple you can play at all 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.769
