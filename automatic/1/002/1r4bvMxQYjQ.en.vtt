00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.390
 hello and welcome if 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.910
 we also in the title reviews the light is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 not so good today as well I have 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.860
 for about two months about no video 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 that's why the whole thing is very 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.290
 Out of round and I'm a little bit upset and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 That's why I hope I forgive myself 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.700
 that I'm probably not pretty 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 will promise a lot 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.020
 yes, but it starts now, yes 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.829
 and therefore welcome to one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.270
 other not very well prepared 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 review 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.640
 I hope you forgive me because I am 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 something from the exercise yes what you see here 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.280
 probably looks at first 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.720
 look like the video cd of boots from 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.610
 to buy this years ago 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.570
 but that's wrong because this is here 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.729
 the single to history resp 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.479
 I kick her around because the cover has 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 he had seen long enough 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.969
 this appeared in 1997 and is one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.020
 Uncoupling of there all dancefloor 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:24.749
 albums but also his trial because then 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.929
 Roland Hensler is just a 1 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:30.060
 history remix-album and history's 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.259
 just the actual album so so 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.799
 and now I would like to 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.039
 daily 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 that's exactly how the cd looks honest 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.859
 said that does not look very cool now 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.719
 honestly made out very cheap 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.209
 I'll try that you read that 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.060
 That's why I'm going to get sharp here 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.179
 In any case, try and do it 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.399
 However it works, you can not do it 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.299
 sensibly recognize but now could 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.130
 Now that's the tracks, yes 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.039
 louis from extremely big different 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.270
 version 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.979
 I'll make you upset if you're there 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.550
 you can still see that here is a nice 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.810
 picture the slt is yes 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 But now I have to do something more 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.980
 I have a bit of a say 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.720
 The feeling as if the thing was one 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.990
 fake or who just can not 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.150
 really you can not do that at all 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.680
 see on the camera but the pressure of the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.990
 is damn bad so I have to 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.050
 go up close so I read that 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.090
 can if I hold in hand and what 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.150
 Strange, that's kind of strange 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.750
 whole but here's just one 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.420
 sheet 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.470
 So that's not all right now 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.570
 booklet or what do you know at least 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:50.230
 can still meet but it is 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.430
 actually a bit like that, so to speak 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.340
 wondered 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 Of course I had to cd this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.210
 buy because there is another 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.560
 version 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.660
 if they have not ruled yet 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 will I do that sometime yes 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.830
 Until then, I hope you hold that 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.750
 a little bit liked 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.480
 I think that part is not that common 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.440
 therefore you should check if you are here 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.440
 she finds I have them I think of 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.180
 flea market bought but I'm not 100 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.770
 percent safe when I get it out of the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.489
 then i have the internet 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.560
 Amazon bought, however, is Amazon 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.420
 Not so full of Michael Jackson 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.180
 singles and so on that should be 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.459
 may visit on ebay or at least 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.270
 at the flea market it is still warm 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.739
 that is still you can go out 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.630
 yes and that would actually be with it 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.090
 the review i hope you have the video 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.350
 like 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.890
 yes and there is another thing 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.200
 and for it is just in 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.370
 Planning everything I have nothing with it 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.360
 I only discovered it and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.959
 I thought I was doing it here 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.650
 mention 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.730
 and there is soon a youtube channel 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.330
 which is called momo ktv or tv or 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.270
 thermal and that is actually 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.390
 then one too 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.850
 channel and there is reported about 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.609
 events with michael jackson 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.950
 or the film just results 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.960
 take partys partying trauma 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.220
 probably also and so a thing 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.430
 and maybe other things as well 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.560
 and behind it I believe 506 people 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.040
 and even partially people from 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.900
 I mean to some TV stations 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.450
 Yes, and all sounds so now first 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.460
 as if that were pretty professional and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.710
 I'm mentally slow 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.660
 Channel wanted for me to watch 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.750
 not that I do that but that 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.710
 I have something to see and many too 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.680
 especially in German and English 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.830
 there's yes I think so with much 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.470
 michael jackson and so and so must 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.850
 I just link it and me 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.100
 put the video description of the 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.630
 called Mallorca tv peeps times where 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.570
 then there is another thing and 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.860
 Although maybe you can get here 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.800
 maybe not yet because I believe it 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.419
 did not die that big but it did 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.210
 is again a new demo of 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.960
 Michael Jackson landed on the internet 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.410
 Namely this is called lamy and is 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.460
 a third version or even fourth 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.760
 version of chicago i ten times short 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.380
 we also have the escape version 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.650
 final version on the album 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.780
 landed then we have the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.229
 expedition original version 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.350
 on the second cd and the paper vault 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.820
 remix that is really bad 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.480
 and now we have just that 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.860
 tradition the more 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.820
 It's rocking with four guitars and stuff like that 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.020
 I keep that on youtube 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.990
 maybe even find it already 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.710
 locked then I link you also hears 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.450
 you just look it in any case and times 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.950
 whether everyone think that the thing is real 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.860
 is because I'm really pretty 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.150
 sure that's a fake because 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.330
 simple is just a lot in fits 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.400
 this song is not together and honest 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.220
 said Michael mostly fits things 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.620
 all together and that's why I think 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.420
 that somebody got there 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.190
 to get the a capella version and 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.370
 So just the whole deep agree 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.110
 get without music and next to one 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.420
 to have remix 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.950
 and of course, say everything is real 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.440
 but I'm not so sure about that 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.420
 and he does not wait too much yes and otherwise 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.730
 I think nothing else is happening 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.170
 was then once again the rumor that 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:47.210
 the bed rest paris 88er on the idea and 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.850
 Unfortunately it was only possible to get that far out 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.850
 whoever was too good 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.730
 I hope I liked the video 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.650
 I hope in the next time there are new ones 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.500
 videos i hope that again soon 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.890
 video and i would say that by 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.890
 next time
