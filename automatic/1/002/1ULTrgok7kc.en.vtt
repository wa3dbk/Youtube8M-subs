00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 pure the invited advanced presents 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.870
 I enjoy the way with johnny hernandez 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 everything you 've always wanted to know 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.769
 about motorcycles and lubricants for a maximum 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.780
 performance you find here in wii 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.780
 sports the channel that we all want 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.570
 well I do not even talk about a very 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.910
 important that is the engine but the engine 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.939
 another party has another part very 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.920
 important that lubrication is what 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.809
 recommendation can give us around 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.239
 lubrication in the council that I give them 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.650
 I give is always try to find the best 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.930
 merchant available in this case 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.629
 we use and I recommend using the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.010
 advanced ultra because it is an oil that 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.260
 meets specifications for 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.750
 racing is an oil that for a greater 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.159
 load of the already to the engine durability of 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.110
 life of the engine this is something very 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.050
 important that you are saving there 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.940
 from burst the rings before the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.879
 piston the friction of the floor with the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.440
 cylinder is smaller than everything already fair 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.649
 and enough for the engine to work well 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.039
 and you save money like in breaking 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.380
 engine there is note that they have a bad oil 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.410
 you are giving is always helping you 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.789
 motorcycle and they burst they are going to lose a lot 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.860
 more money than if you're having fun 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.600
 a good oil at the end of the month does not 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 you will notice at the end of the year of those who 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.550
 you are giving the bike in addition the important thing 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.990
 which is precisely that issue of 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.689
 friction because if it is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.210
 a lubricant that generates less friction 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.759
 Well, it's supposed to have the engine 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.619
 more loose will use more power 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.810
 and will consume less fuel 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.000
 exactly there is also what I 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.350
 I say the durability of the engine the long 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 terminal motor life you buy a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.090
 motorcycle and not bought for two months or 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.240
 for six months and buying a motorcycle is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.670
 to have it for time then between 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 better a lubricant use more time you go 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.549
 to have prettier to have an engine and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.549
 Maybe it's working
