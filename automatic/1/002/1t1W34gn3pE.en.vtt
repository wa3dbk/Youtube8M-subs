00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello very good kids we are in a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.210
 new video tutorial on how to install the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.470
 series running network of alex el capo landmark 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.670
 nacho just finished the first 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 episode said good so I 'm going to do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.530
 a video tutorial for those who do not know 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.199
 how to install this and good sometimes 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.490
 it happens that nobody knows very well the country of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.930
 mods and all this and this is pretty 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.930
 simple, so I'll explain 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 first step we come to fit the beast and you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.789
 we give to download excel and it will lower us 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.380
 a file this is the one for users 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
 premium now after I'll tell you the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 page for non-premium users worth 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 everything very easy here we have the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 launcher of fit the beast we download it and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 we have it here it's worth important things 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 what to do with the launcher run as 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 administrator is always worth it because 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.420
 some have problems when it comes to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.660
 write the files write the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 mochis and so on, so this is going to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.590
 be very easy here you have all 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 speedboats first thing we're going to do 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.710
 these attentive both the users prizes 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.260
 like the non-premium because it's the same 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 for the two people we have here in the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 installation folder folder 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 installation we will be able to put it where 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.270
 I want to recommend 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.920
 have it in a visible place like him 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.250
 and finally we can have it here 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 very well very at hand all then you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.820
 we give here at the end of view and we would have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.530
 this this type of root is valid for this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 these packs of many do not put it on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 the main clan normal because there will be 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 there is a mess and a pifostio of care 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.080
 the maximum rom I recommend three because 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.150
 there are quite enough mods that number 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.760
 of moche in the pack sometimes 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 there are 20 30 up 50 to 150 so 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.210
 give him enough ram 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 if you have computers with less ram then 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 give it all you can if you have 4 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 give 3 if you have 2 give one you know 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 be late enough priority to this 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.580
 because they are packs that if you want to 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.759
 work well you need this 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.500
 work next thing 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.420
 if you have a good computer you can 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.740
 use them optimization arguments for 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.990
 fast computer means that if 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.450
 we have a good computer this is going to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.100
 serve so that everything goes better then 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.259
 I know that if on our computer the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.899
 damn you do not give him because if he is not going to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 work we have the problem of java 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.770
 many have problems in the java or that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.319
 I will explain it if we go advanced 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.670
 options if it gives you download problems 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.850
 to start what you have to do is 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.440
 change change the download location 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.900
 because here we have several servers 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.850
 how the mods are downloaded then by 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.380
 defect are automatic if you have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.870
 problems when downloading if in 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.990
 the console gives you some sort of error 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.300
 download come here and change this is 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.110
 one of the problems that can come up 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.420
 in java peace in java peace is simply 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.840
 the directory then if it gives us 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.240
 problems with 1.8 well we changed to 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 1.7 the norm I have a default and I 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.640
 it works but any 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.900
 thing 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.200
 here the windows site that good not 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.209
 you have to change and so on and all this 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.120
 It's good if you can remove the car 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.010
 maximize if you want for this I am a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.830
 Consumer tastes are not options 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 are going to greatly influence things a 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.380
 Once all this has been arranged to go to 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.020
 our to our running network we come to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.480
 say stop pax and we give radio in 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.500
 ok network as you see with all this that I have 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 I 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.470
 if we give you to play previously you have 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.560
 to have put your name 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.480
 and password of premium user in 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.790
 minecraft to the non premium now I'm going 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.620
 to say where you have to download and the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.980
 The only difference that will happen is that 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.480
 are you going to have that option or whatever 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.400
 profile that you put any such is going to 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.340
 work if here you put a profile that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.270
 it's bad what's going to happen is that you 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.120
 some kind of failure and let us enter 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.470
 Now I'm going to tell you more or less where 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 where is the thing as you see it works 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.489
 perfectly so if you have any 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.510
 kind of problem follow the tutorial well 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.640
 and if not then tell me but try 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.989
 follow things step by step but good 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.220
 Tell me if you have a problem 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.380
 I answer in the comments as I have 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.940
 done in the other tutorials you know 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.400
 I have helped many people so that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.080
 work for them and that they do not conquer 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.970
 least I have put in my pocket 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.820
 things for the non-premium now not 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.630
 premium ok let's fit the beast cracker 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:16.070
 here on this page that is gregory 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.750
 ftp bar blogspot.com 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.430
 in the description do not worry but 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.930
 here you see it well as it is order to take 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.210
 hosting it will be much easier 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.850
 we give abbas to download it from the mega 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.290
 we went down from mega ok and here goes so much 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.150
 when you want it will start I said 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.100
 that are quite a pack of mods that's why 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.110
 It's going to take a while, do not worry and 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.520
 this stays a little while 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.750
 because the truth that they are enough 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.389
 many and very heavy some for it 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.000
 we kept going by the cracker ok now 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.440
 when this starts, if it gives me a 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.160
 little bit of time you see we have it 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.979
 here the mods are 131 very active and they are 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.410
 enough so patience with the 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.139
 beginnings and give it quite run for that 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.669
 because it 's a pretty billet pack 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.130
 llama is single player good well here 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.229
 we have to start and all the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.870
 roll and let's have this pack of mods 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.380
 which basically has all these 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.910
 that we see here ok so for the moment 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.460
 this already and I would say where 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.759
 download them non premium 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.380
 arranged we will see here we download it 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.330
 we download mega I recommend 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.900
 mega but good you have here then everything 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.240
 the rest if you want we come here and this 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.800
 is what we would have a point file 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.690
 jar we double click wrong sorry 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.419
 because we must also give it to execute 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.040
 as an administrator with properties 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.590
 we come to 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.450
 we come to advanced options options 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.640
 advanced is not I think this is not 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.270
 can run as administrator I think 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.320
 that there is some kind of 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.120
 well this is a genius you can 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.100
 run as administrator but good 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.880
 you should not have any problem 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.740
 it here as you see it puts me that this does not 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.680
 do not worry because 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.370
 that gives an error but it works 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.680
 just ok that's a mistake of the christ 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.860
 action or something like that that works then 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.789
 here we have the same options we give 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.889
 basically all the same options 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:21.380
 here this is smaller but good in 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:24.620
 java path changes but basically it's 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.479
 the same and you just have to give it here 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.130
 this should work or if you have the 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.770
 updated java so remember 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.810
 always have the java updated for 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.819
 avoid mistakes all this is equal to give 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.530
 pretty branch to the subject but now here 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:39.470
 we have to select profile that is worth here 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.810
 anything 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 4 it 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.940
 we give and should already work our 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.680
 radios networks and we give to play I what 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.009
 I have downloaded the other I guess 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.449
 It should be the same as you see so nothing 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.069
 more boys you see works 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.169
 perfectly if you follow the tutorial what 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:56.389
 you have to have any kind of problem 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.120
