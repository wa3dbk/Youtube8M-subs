00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
bit on the shot-blocking I think but the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.580

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
he does play as good he's got potential

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.360 
he does play as good he's got potential
but<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:36.960> can<00:04:37.080> do<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.169> little<00:04:37.320> bit<00:04:37.500> better<00:04:37.680> Chris

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
but you can do a little bit better Chris
