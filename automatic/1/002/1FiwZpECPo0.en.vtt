00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
small in the beginning because they're

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
they don't quite understand how to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.959

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.770 
noodle how to fret the guitar okay and
this<00:00:48.059> takes<00:00:48.480> both<00:00:49.140> instruction<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.420> time<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this takes both instruction and time and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
this takes both instruction and time and
practice<00:00:52.440> okay<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:53.910> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
practice okay so not just time but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.400 
practice okay so not just time but
practice<00:00:54.660> okay<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:57.870> happens<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
practice okay now what happens in the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
practice okay now what happens in the
beginning<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.579> folks<00:00:59.850> approach

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
beginning is that when folks approach

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
beginning is that when folks approach
the<00:01:00.449> guitar<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> wrap

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the guitar they really want to wrap

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
the guitar they really want to wrap
their<00:01:02.100> hand<00:01:02.340> around<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.760> neck<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
their hand around the neck like this and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
their hand around the neck like this and
that's<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:04.949> natural<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.909> pick

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that's very natural because when we pick

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
that's very natural because when we pick
up<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.330> shovel<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> broom<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.439> something<00:01:07.799> like

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
up a shovel or a broom or something like

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
up a shovel or a broom or something like
that<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.280> palm<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.390> there

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that we palm it we put it right there

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
that we palm it we put it right there
because<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.439> how<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.740> hold<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.520> things

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because that's how we hold on to things

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
because that's how we hold on to things
so<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.180> fall<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> our<00:01:12.689> hands<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so they don't fall out of our hands we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
so they don't fall out of our hands we
don't<00:01:13.320> hold<00:01:13.710> things<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> were

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
don't hold things like this if you were

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.460 
don't hold things like this if you were
going<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.600> into<00:01:15.900> battle<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> were

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
going off into battle and you were

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.880 
going off into battle and you were
holding<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.799> battle<00:01:17.220> axe<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.890> it's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
holding your battle axe like this it's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.230 
holding your battle axe like this it's
going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> fall<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.640> hands<00:01:21.030> you're

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
going to fall out of your hands you're

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.570 
going to fall out of your hands you're
going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.659> head<00:01:21.780> chopped<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.200> so

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
going to get your head chopped off so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.980 
going to get your head chopped off so
we're<00:01:23.580> used<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> grabbing<00:01:24.210> things<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
we're used to grabbing things like this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.530 
we're used to grabbing things like this
this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.380> very<00:01:25.650> loose<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.640> our<00:01:26.820> blood<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> do

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
this is very loose in our blood to do

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
this is very loose in our blood to do
this<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:29.070> natural

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
this you know so it's not very natural

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
this you know so it's not very natural
for<00:01:29.640> us<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.420> okay

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
for us to do this okay

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
for us to do this okay
so<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.060> means<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.110> train

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so what that means is we have to train

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
so what that means is we have to train
ourselves<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> everybody<00:01:36.210> from
