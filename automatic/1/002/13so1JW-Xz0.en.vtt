16<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.600> think<00:00:19.529> I'm<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.710> beginning<00:00:19.980> might<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
16 I think I'm not beginning might be

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.920 
16 I think I'm not beginning might be
getting<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.029> bit<00:00:21.210> soft<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> lot<00:00:21.900> of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
getting a little bit soft and a lot of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.960 
getting a little bit soft and a lot of
people<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.350> names<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.039> mean<00:00:23.580> numbers<00:00:23.850> in

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
people to have names I mean numbers in

people to have names I mean numbers in
their<00:00:24.060> names<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

though<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.650> kind<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.890> cheap<00:00:26.099> oh

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
though I think it's kind of cheap oh

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.550 
though I think it's kind of cheap oh
that's<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:29.060> that's<00:00:30.060> too<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.599> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
