00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.629
 continue to make our site one of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.269
 recommendations is creating your background 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.639
 site left and right so that the content 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.639
 on the part I stood out a little bit I did not 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.539
 proponent of a very contrasting background when 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.300
 let's say in the middle everything is very light and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 the sides are dark or vice versa but nonetheless 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.210
 I'll show you how to do it. 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.820
 some 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 one of the easiest next on 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 empty screen in empty space right 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.670
 click the mouse button and select 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 page properties section formatting 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.629
 colors the background is now worth the author choose 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.850
 what a contrasting color for example 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 navy blue here we press ok 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.170
 our whole page is painted in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.090
 dark blue color 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 Now you need those areas in which 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.270
 will the content invert then do 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 white right mouse button click on 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 that part of the sites that need 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.200
 invert 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:14.729
 cell properties background color from auto 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.710
 we put white flour here 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.759
 the part became light the same 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.759
 doing with the rest 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.290
 segments that are needed 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.350
 invert cell properties color white 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.540
 apply here you see now 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.119
 content on i'm part of it is white and she 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.430
 clearly stands out you can sat down to watch 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.610
 in order to see how it will be 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.770
 look like i do not recommend 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 too much contrast and because 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 a bit annoying but sometimes 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 there is no other option and you need to do 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.710
 just so then we fill the site 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.380
 content if in part of the text here everything 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.840
 just you can copy and paste 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 then in part of the pictures a little more complicated 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.659
 but I will tell about it on our next 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.659
 the lesson
