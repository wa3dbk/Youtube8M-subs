00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 for many entrepreneurs a single tax 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.500
 on imputed income 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.359
 is a real salvation 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.010
 own small business 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.059
 It is therefore not surprising that any 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.400
 tax law change 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.769
 Russia is bound by a wall of water causing 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.190
 heightened interest what are the innovations 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.490
 since the beginning of 2013, the first 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.350
 the most important innovations are 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.189
 transition to a single tax on imputed 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.710
 income 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.010
 became voluntary ie is there 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 formerly an individual entrepreneur 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 or organizations were going to engage with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.590
 some kind of activity 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.200
 then if this activity was 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.239
 prescribed in head 26 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 note 3 of the tax code and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.620
 representative bodies of local 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.620
 self listed 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.180
 taxable in the form 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 single tax on imputed income too 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.770
 the right of choice was not clear 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.500
 only the system was used 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.060
 taxation is visible water now with 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.299
 the new year it became voluntary then 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 there are articles 346 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.210
 straight 28 spelled out that the transition to no 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.420
 tax system is 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.520
 voluntary ie individual 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 the entrepreneur is not entitled to choose 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.500
 besides this system there let's say the general 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.689
 patent taxation system 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.030
 system which is also here with us 1 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.650
 January 2013 entered into force 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.590
 simplified system well or stay on 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.549
 single tax on imputed income 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.170
 organizations and individual 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.509
 entrepreneurs expressed desire 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 go to the payment of a single tax should 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.200
 file within five days of the day you start 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 apply the system attachment in the form 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.520
 Endowment application for registration 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 There have been changes in the limit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 headcount 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.600
 if before the limitation on the number of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.450
 there were up to 100 people 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.350
 but it was the average number 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 that is, they did not turn in there, say 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.649
 temporary some attracted 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.439
 workers are now considered average 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.280
 if there is a separate order 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.280
 who cares 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.780
 handle there individually i'm 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.299
 Of course I do not think that we have such a large 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.030
 entrepreneur who exceeds this 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.859
 but the number has changed 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.689
 forms for calculating my new income for 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.579
 quarter and is calculated based on 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.370
 completely from working on it besides 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.840
 there have been changes in the tax base she 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.640
 we have 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.439
 previously interfered and now continues 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.269
 decrease by the amount paid 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.730
 insurance premiums on compulsory 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.019
 pound pension insurance 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.500
 compulsory health insurance 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.239
 social security fund 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.889
 Well, now the word of the year still 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.109
 added allowance for temporary 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:03:00.950
 disability paid for 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:04.389
 workers but as I know arises 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:11.150
 a lot of questions about 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:13.819
 restriction by means and deducting it by 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.620
 paid insurance premiums 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.440
 how to say all entrepreneur us 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.690
 divided into 2 categories that is, those who 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.459
 has attracted workers and those who 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.530
 individually exercise your 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.190
 activity 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.379
 Well, but for those who have 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.739
 attracted worker here and 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.709
 the amount of insurance premiums for which he 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:41.329
 can reduce calculated single tax 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.639
 they are limited to 50 percent that is how 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.129
 we have not written in the tax code 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.970
 more than 50 percent can 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.030
 decrease 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.430
 quarterly amount of numerically tax for 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.079
 those who do not have employees and 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.319
 pays fixed payments only 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.560
 for themselves restrictions 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.629
 Here are these percentages of interest is not 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.909
 right up to 100 percent 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.609
 can be reduced the amount of numbers well 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.739
