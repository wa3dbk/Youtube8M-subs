00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello very good team vote again for 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.850
 the epic play of the week 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.250
 no epic play has happened like 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.580
 the one from the previous one but good this is what 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.900
 most epic that has happened this week 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.520
 I'm playing in this game as 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.520
 you can see with a sector 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.250
 attentive to this clockwork that is now 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.350
 same staying alone and we have 30 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.100
 enemies here that will go will make you stay 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.000
 we are going to put you on both teams 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
 to see it well 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.949
 and we are going to put it at normal speed and 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.949
 on free camera and right now I'm here 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.490
 and I realize that they will win at 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.420
 what then ping 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.120
 so that everyone goes there there is no 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.520
 but http stays here locked in the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.520
 store begin to fit 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.190
 wisely hooks it omnilife that at 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.159
 final he goes here we have a centaur and 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.580
 they developed these four trapped in 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.580
 the damn 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.300
 and ended up like that with a rampage with all the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 rival team 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.070
 let's see the play again 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.740
 just like the other time in the middle of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 speed 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 let's increase a little bit 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.810
 I think it has happened to me rewinding 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.480
 I liked more power 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.640
 we'll see 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.640
 and here we have it I think because they separate 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.780
 the three who come to bleach him for 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.880
 here behind villagra as for why 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.700
 he goes into the store and this is where 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.210
 start the move let's lower everything 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.690
 this is going to put my perspective for 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.680
 that you see 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 from my perspective 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.580
 then you have the middle electoral has 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.050
 right in the middle of the four and I put the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.050
 last right in the middle of the pictures 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.430
 here we want another one just when they are left 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.430
 three 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.560
 thus getting the rampage and up to here 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.819
 the epic move this week I hope 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.819
 that you liked this video 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.260
 with this already 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.140
 I hope that these next weeks 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.440
 and some basic play in raise fire 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.680
 same as last week 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.420
 but good you do what you can with 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.620
 these the video game until the next 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.620
 video a greeting
