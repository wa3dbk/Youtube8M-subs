00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.100
 good hello youtube friends today you 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.490
 Now I have to leave the link when the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:27.670
 two link that is from the sounds of the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:30.580
 weapons and weapons the subject and other things 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.790
 the players I think also against 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.650
 this reader against the strike 1.6 ok 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.650
 only one that I am going to explain now is 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.630
 install are is the sound that most 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.950
 of people know where the 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.200
 folder and the rest of you here is 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.230
 this folder is very complete or that 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.160
 is with the whole name of the folder 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.170
 location to make it easier good 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.810
 here is the sound that the first thing that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.040
 let's do is look where where 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.040
 let's have the counter 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 we seek to maintain the counter 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
 and you can do it in a way that I did 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.570
 so right click properties search 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 look for destination or most of what has 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.789
 on local disk the program was archived 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.789
 valve or against traigo 1.6 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.030
 Well, you always have to look for 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.310
 the names the folder that most 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.549
 times of the sounds invite the cessation 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.360
 strike and see what you have and we have 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.679
 here they are here we have are and here we have 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.539
 we pons and here we have a good sope what 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.539
 what we are going to do is copy everything 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.280
 we can drag it as you want 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.280
 I did not want to do not place 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 here I am moving here is everything already 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 very good I'm going to show you the counter 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.009
 so they can see that I do not have any 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.500
 subject only what the only thing that I have 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.950
 put is this the sound of weapons 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.950
 okay 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.210
 and when they see you answer as always 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.330
 as one would install if it is peeled 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.410
 Well, everything is good 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.330
 Well what are you going to do is 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.810
 install the other patches as I do 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.370
 I did with youth says a how-to tutorial 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.310
 explain how to install cream and all that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.230
 well I'll put a break and while I'm doing 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.210
 that and at the end of showing the result 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.820
 of the topic that I have uploaded ok 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.230
 good friends and here I have put the 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.430
 issue by counteracting something that then 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.890
 show how the content is exactly 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.780
 ok look how it looks like the contrast is 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.230
 wanda to counter and south is not like that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.069
 but it's very similar how good it is here 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.659
 all this very truthfully use the truth 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.940
 I'm going to put a lot of money 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.180
 to show 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.860
 as it is playing the arms and everything not 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.850

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.610
 when I play but I will show you the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.790
 weapons and everything else that I change 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.790

 from here 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.519

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.739
 plans I do not know why but good what 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.810

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.260
