00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
open a gate in between but I don't think

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.250 
open a gate in between but I don't think
that's<00:00:28.560> gonna<00:00:28.680> happen<00:00:35.510> sealing<00:00:36.510> which<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that's gonna happen sealing which I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.229 
that's gonna happen sealing which I
guess<00:00:37.979> we<00:00:38.129> had<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.629> start<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> painting

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239

this<00:02:47.790> technology's<00:02:48.790> new<00:02:48.910> identity<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.720> way

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
this technology's new identity in a way

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.810 
this technology's new identity in a way
I<00:02:50.170> think<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.739> notion<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.130> new<00:02:51.280> identity<00:02:51.730> is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
I think that notion of new identity is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.470 
I think that notion of new identity is
probably<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.480> revelatory

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
probably one of the more revelatory

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.520 
probably one of the more revelatory

this has been the most difficult part of
the<00:03:06.940> whole<00:03:07.320> project<00:03:08.320> because<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.550> when

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
the whole project because this is when

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.640 
the whole project because this is when
