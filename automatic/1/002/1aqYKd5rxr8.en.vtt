notice I'm setting the destination type
as<00:01:40.770> file<00:01:41.159> URI<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.509> it's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
as file URI and that is so that it's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.230 
as file URI and that is so that it's
really<00:01:42.990> simple<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.250> set<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> source<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
really simple to set the source for that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:55.690 
really simple to set the source for that
image<00:01:45.450> tag<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.960> created<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> HTML<00:01:46.979> file

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.160 

alright<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.149> adding<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> code<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
alright so now I'm adding the code to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080 
alright so now I'm adding the code to
read<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> latitude<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.460> longitude<00:01:59.610> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
read the latitude and longitude you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
read the latitude and longitude you
notice<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> only<00:02:00.630> takes<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.110> few<00:02:01.140> lines<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
notice it only takes a few lines here to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.690 
notice it only takes a few lines here to
get<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.189> done<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.979> now<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> set

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
get this done and now I'm going to set

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.820 
get this done and now I'm going to set
up<00:02:05.729> these<00:02:05.970> two<00:02:06.299> buttons<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.289> call<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
up these two buttons to call the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.740 
up these two buttons to call the
function<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.190> had<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.399> JavaScript<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.209> then

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
function we had in JavaScript and then

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.100 
function we had in JavaScript and then
add<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> reference<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.860> main<00:02:11.069> j/s<00:02:11.670> file<00:02:12.110> so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
add a reference to that main j/s file so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.330 
add a reference to that main j/s file so
here's<00:02:13.349> our<00:02:13.500> app<00:02:13.680> running<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> emulator

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
here's our app running in the emulator

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.339 
here's our app running in the emulator
I'm<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.269> go<00:02:15.330> ahead<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.660> select<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.110> photo

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
I'm going to go ahead and select a photo

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.680 
I'm going to go ahead and select a photo
from<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.739> photo<00:02:17.069> library<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.819> there<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.510> have

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
from the photo library and there we have

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.390 
from the photo library and there we have
it<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.230> see<00:02:19.380> our<00:02:19.500> GPS<00:02:19.950> coordinates<00:02:20.310> at

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it and we can see our GPS coordinates at

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.290 
it and we can see our GPS coordinates at
the<00:02:20.459> bottom<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.330> take<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.630> photo<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.060> also

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
the bottom if I take a photo we can also

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.780 
the bottom if I take a photo we can also
see<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.959> photo<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.739> now<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.760> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
see that the photo is there now one of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
see that the photo is there now one of
the<00:02:26.910> cool<00:02:27.120> things<00:02:27.390> about<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.049> Windows<00:02:28.530> Phone

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the cool things about the Windows Phone

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.440 
the cool things about the Windows Phone
emulator<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> lets<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.610> change<00:02:29.850> your<00:02:30.060> GPS

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
emulator is it lets you change your GPS

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.910 
emulator is it lets you change your GPS
location<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> map<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.830> go

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
location on a map so I'm going to go

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.590 
location on a map so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.250> set<00:02:32.400> myself<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.239> Cincinnati

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
ahead and set myself to be in Cincinnati

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.470 
ahead and set myself to be in Cincinnati
and<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.100> reload<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.610> app<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.360> were

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and if I reload the app because we were

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.770 
and if I reload the app because we were
calling<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> GPS<00:02:37.410> onload<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.330> see<00:02:39.540> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
calling the GPS onload we can see that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.500 
calling the GPS onload we can see that
the<00:02:40.049> new<00:02:40.170> coordinates<00:02:40.680> are<00:02:40.860> there<00:02:41.360> all<00:02:42.360> right

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
the new coordinates are there all right

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.970 
the new coordinates are there all right
so<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:42.780> I'm<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> go<00:02:43.110> ahead<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.680> run

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so now I'm going to go ahead and and run

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.229 
so now I'm going to go ahead and and run

switch<00:02:45.480> visual<00:02:45.959> studio<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.410> deploy<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
switch visual studio to deploy to a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.229 
switch visual studio to deploy to a
Windows<00:02:47.489> Phone<00:02:47.519> device<00:02:48.170> hit<00:02:49.170> run<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.239> my
