rest of the tank but it still looks very

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.990 
rest of the tank but it still looks very

threatening in general the color scheme
is<00:01:08.030> fitting<00:01:08.810> for<00:01:08.840> both<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.470> Hulk<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.280> tank

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810

plus<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.140> grain<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.409> gob<00:01:12.860> provides<00:01:13.340> some

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619

the<00:01:18.859> whole<00:01:19.100> way<00:01:19.369> section<00:01:20.000> can<00:01:20.210> be<00:01:20.240> seen<00:01:20.600> from

the whole way section can be seen from
the<00:01:20.930> back<00:01:21.609> so<00:01:22.719> this<00:01:23.719> is<00:01:23.930> best<00:01:24.200> viewed<00:01:24.530> from<00:01:24.890> the

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
the back so this is best viewed from the

the back so this is best viewed from the
front<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.920> tank<00:01:28.219> roll

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
front the tank roll

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.279 
front the tank roll
and<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.350> gun<00:01:30.590> moves<00:01:30.950> up<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.340> down<00:01:32.170> but<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
and the gun moves up and down but the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.779 
and the gun moves up and down but the
turret<00:01:33.680> doesn't<00:01:34.009> turn<00:01:34.280> due<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.670> the

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
turret doesn't turn due to the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.960 
turret doesn't turn due to the
transformation<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.950> gun<00:01:37.219> doesn't<00:01:37.759> fire

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
transformation the gun doesn't fire

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.179 
transformation the gun doesn't fire
anything<00:01:38.689> for<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> same<00:01:39.229> reason<00:01:41.770> perhaps<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
anything for the same reason perhaps the

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.980 
anything for the same reason perhaps the
biggest<00:01:43.429> problem<00:01:44.000> with<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.270> tank<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.810> its

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
biggest problem with this tank is its

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.340 
biggest problem with this tank is its
stability<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:47.030> turret<00:01:47.360> doesn't<00:01:47.750> peg<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.170> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
stability the turret doesn't peg on to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.700 
stability the turret doesn't peg on to
the<00:01:48.500> body<00:01:48.740> very<00:01:49.009> solidly<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:51.049> gun<00:01:51.319> tends

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
the body very solidly and the gun tends

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.710 
the body very solidly and the gun tends
to<00:01:51.920> split<00:01:52.220> apart<00:01:52.340> as<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.880> move<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.420> up<00:01:53.509> and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
to split apart as you move it up and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.320 
to split apart as you move it up and
down<00:01:57.130> see<00:01:58.130> what<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.310> mean<00:02:00.909> despite<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
down see what I mean despite the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.749 
down see what I mean despite the
problems<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.990> causes<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.649> like<00:02:04.580> the

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
problems it causes I like the

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.190 
problems it causes I like the
transformation<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.569> this<00:02:05.720> figure<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.869> treads

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
transformation of this figure the treads

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.150 
transformation of this figure the treads
become<00:02:09.619> arms<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.940> turret<00:02:11.269> becomes<00:02:11.630> legs

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
become arms and the turret becomes legs

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.680 
become arms and the turret becomes legs
with<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.310> gaud<00:02:13.519> halves<00:02:13.790> forming<00:02:14.360> heel<00:02:14.599> spurs

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
with the gaud halves forming heel spurs

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.130 
with the gaud halves forming heel spurs
it's<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.840> unique<00:02:18.290> conversion<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> tank<00:02:19.459> and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
it's a unique conversion for a tank and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.720 
it's a unique conversion for a tank and
makes<00:02:21.140> for<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.470> more<00:02:21.680> interesting<00:02:21.739> figure

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
makes for a more interesting figure

00:02:22.730 --> 00:03:12.940 
makes for a more interesting figure
overall

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.870 

though<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.849> alt<00:03:14.060> mode<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.569> okay<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.310> met<00:03:16.610> mode

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
though the alt mode is okay the met mode

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.650 
though the alt mode is okay the met mode
is<00:03:17.090> where<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.510> figure<00:03:17.720> really<00:03:18.260> shines<00:03:19.660> like

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
is where the figure really shines like

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.960 
is where the figure really shines like

with the tank his proportions are

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.930 
with the tank his proportions are
positively<00:03:23.959> monstrous<00:03:24.860> which<00:03:25.430> suits<00:03:25.760> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.809 

I<00:05:00.770> think<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.860> ladder<00:05:02.069> will<00:05:02.310> become<00:05:02.699> an

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
I think the ladder will become an

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.020 
I think the ladder will become an
addiction<00:05:03.060> for<00:05:03.479> some<00:05:06.439> finally<00:05:07.439> I<00:05:07.879> said<00:05:08.879> the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
addiction for some finally I said the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.779 
addiction for some finally I said the
met<00:05:09.240> looks<00:05:09.479> fairly<00:05:09.780> clean<00:05:10.080> all<00:05:10.500> around<00:05:10.800> but

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
met looks fairly clean all around but

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.719 
met looks fairly clean all around but
these<00:05:12.030> panels<00:05:12.629> don't<00:05:13.319> peg<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:13.889> very<00:05:14.159> securely

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
these panels don't peg in very securely

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.740 
these panels don't peg in very securely
and<00:05:15.830> these<00:05:16.830> panels<00:05:17.340> don't<00:05:18.000> peg<00:05:18.270> into<00:05:18.509> anything

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
and these panels don't peg into anything

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.209

at<00:05:19.020> all<00:05:20.000> other<00:05:21.000> than<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:22.710> is<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.949> cool

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
at all other than that this is a cool

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
looking mech he has his flaws but I

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.899 
looking mech he has his flaws but I
think<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.349> can<00:05:28.530> safely<00:05:28.740> suggest<00:05:29.340> that<00:05:29.610> if<00:05:29.759> you

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
think I can safely suggest that if you

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.990 
think I can safely suggest that if you
only<00:05:30.090> pick<00:05:30.419> up<00:05:30.539> one<00:05:30.900> Marvel<00:05:31.379> crossover<00:05:32.009> make

only pick up one Marvel crossover make
