fair if a lower rate goalkeeper could
save<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:17.040> post<00:04:17.340> came<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.760> rescue<00:04:18.060> there

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390

save it so the post came to rescue there
for<00:04:18.630> them<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:21.090> bit<00:04:21.479> more<00:04:21.720> action<00:04:22.169> coming<00:04:22.200> up

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
for them and a bit more action coming up

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.150 
for them and a bit more action coming up
with<00:04:23.490> drive<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.120> over<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.419> bar<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> 3-1<00:04:25.979> win

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
with drive it over the bar so a 3-1 win

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.440 
with drive it over the bar so a 3-1 win
and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.280 
and
I<00:04:27.510> don't<00:04:28.290> know<00:04:28.440> if<00:04:28.590> that's<00:04:28.830> us<00:04:29.130> out<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> the

there I don't even look at the name over
the<00:04:46.500> player<00:04:46.770> i<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:47.130> see<00:04:47.280> Ronaldo<00:04:47.580> every<00:04:48.060> time

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
the player i just see Ronaldo every time

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.550 
the player i just see Ronaldo every time
I<00:04:48.300> see<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.660> ball<00:04:48.840> hit<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.140> back<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
I see the ball hit in the back of the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.030 
I see the ball hit in the back of the
net<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:51.150> I'm<00:04:51.510> hoping<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.110> sign<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.560> Brazilian

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
net so I'm hoping to sign the Brazilian

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.560 
net so I'm hoping to sign the Brazilian
Ronaldo<00:04:53.430> bringing<00:04:53.760> back<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.180> club<00:04:54.450> I

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
Ronaldo bringing back to the club I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.140 
Ronaldo bringing back to the club I
think<00:04:54.840> he's<00:04:54.990> 27<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.070> no<00:04:56.220> because<00:04:56.850> that's

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
think he's 27 in and no because that's

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.290 
think he's 27 in and no because that's
the<00:04:57.360> age<00:04:57.510> he<00:04:57.690> was<00:04:58.160> before<00:04:59.160> he<00:04:59.490> signed<00:05:00.000> for

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
the age he was before he signed for

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.350 
the age he was before he signed for
Madrid<00:05:01.200> if<00:05:01.350> i'm<00:05:01.500> not<00:05:01.620> mistaken<00:05:02.000> so<00:05:03.000> we<00:05:03.180> got

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
Madrid if i'm not mistaken so we got

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.080 
Madrid if i'm not mistaken so we got
through<00:05:03.690> anyway<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:05.370> looks<00:05:05.580> like<00:05:05.730> were

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
