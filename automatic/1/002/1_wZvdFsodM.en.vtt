00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.330
 There are two ways to make money in trading. 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.420
 Here are two options for how you can reach the monthly 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.430
 benchmark earnings in futures trading on MOEX, stocks, 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 Forex (Forex). 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.850
 The first is to sit one, two or three very large, 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.510
 large trend in the market, that is, to conclude two or three 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.140
 big deals that bring you the whole month 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.140
 profit. 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 In this case, it is the multiplication of capital, since on one 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 you make a lot of money right away by providing 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 this is a rapid increase in the trading account. 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.829
 Analogue to this - to hit the bank in a casino or win 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.110
 million in the lottery. 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.809
 Or if we talk about the real business, for example, floral 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.350
 business: those who sell flowers, for them such days, 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.199
 like February 14, March 8, September 1 - these are the days in which 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.260
 they can fulfill their entire monthly income. 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.019
 So, similarly for us, traders, this 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.219
 catch two or three very large trends for the month and make 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.900
 on these two or three large transactions, the entire profit of the month. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.472
 The second option is to accumulate profit in day trading. 

00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:09.430
 or swing trading gradually in small portions over 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.290
 the trading month, that is, the addition of trading capital. 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.830
 On many deals, you'll make a little money, 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.220
 providing a slow increase in the trading account. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.330
 An analogue of this is any business in the world, be it a large business. 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 a corporation that sells cars or computers, 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940
 or a small private business. 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.540
 For example, you have a clothing store, and you sell jeans. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.520
 With each pair of jeans sold you will receive 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 small profit. 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 But since in a month you will sell a large number of pairs 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.730
 jeans, then all these little profits in the amount after 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.710
 as you add them up, form a large amount by the end 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 of the month. 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.220
 Same thing, if you sell flowers, and if it's not March 8th, 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.940
 February 14 and September 1, then you will sell 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.290
 and provide yourself a profit in exactly the same way. 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.190
 Small profit from each sold flower, but in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.319
 amount for the entire month after the sale of a large batch 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.219
 flowers, you will get a larger amount. 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.510
 That is, either the first method, or the second method, or 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.550
 the combination of both these ways is exactly how they are made 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.239
 money, both in trading and in real business. 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.380
 What is also important to know here is which way 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.999
 to focus on trading. 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.739
 Personally, in my trading I focus on 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.180
 gradual accumulation of profits on small trends, 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.810
 that is, in transactions in which the risk / reward ratio 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.909
 it turns out 1: 2, 1: 3 and sometimes 1: 1. 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.650
 But in total for the month, the total value is large, 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.190
 and it reaches the monthly benchmark. 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.481
 I see that many traders open trading every day. 

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.610
 terminal and hope that today will be "March 8" 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.569
 that today will be a big trending day that they 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.299
 make a lot of money in one day or a lot of money 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.390
 on a single trade transaction. 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.230
 I am not a supporter of this. 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.890
 Need to work just like any other 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.739
 another real business. 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.349
 Most of the time, most of the year, most 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.840
 part of the month profit in any business is done 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.739
 accumulation 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.670
 in small portions. 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.269
 And then this amount is formed in a large amount. 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.969
 There are no small profits in trading. 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.529
 Profit can seem small on only one 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.249
 deal. 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:56.419
 But if you look at a series of such deals in which 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.981
 you made relatively small profits, then in total 

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:00.630
 recruited a great value. 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.439
 In real business, no one is sitting and not waiting when 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.510
 it will be March 8, September 1 or February 14. 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.099
 Or if we are talking about the same America, then they have Christmas 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.100
 December 25 - no one is sitting and not waiting for him. 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.350
 It happens once a year. 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.860
 For most of the year, the business operates due to the fact that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.030
 for sale. 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.700
 Profit is formed in small portions. 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.920
 It needs to be understood. 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.750
 Very many traders underestimate this, especially those traders 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.040
 that focus on catching big trends 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040
 on the exchange. 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.660
 They donâ€™t accept small profits at all. 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.100
 neglect her. 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.820
 That is, they can enter into a transaction, and this transaction can 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.650
 bring them a risk / reward ratio of 1: 3, 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.160
 1: 4 or 1: 5, but such a trend, a small trend, or if 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.780
 This is a moderate trend, it may not develop into a big one. 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780
 trend. 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.160
 As a result, this profit will disappear, and they will leave without a breakeven, 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.320
 either with a loss on stop loss and earn nothing 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.930
 on this market movement. 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.880
 For those traders who catch big trends, they are very 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.810
 often give profit to flow blindly, that is, they put 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.350
 either wide trailing stops, or do not put them, but simply 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.190
 set a profit target (take profit), where they will exit, 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.670
 and sit and wait for it to be fulfilled. 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.140
 This trading approach works, but you just need to understand 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.350
 that still need to approach the market more flexibly. 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.141
 It is necessary to combine both methods of making profit. 

00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:35.141
 in trading. 

00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.510
 Personally, I focus on accumulating profits, 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.411
 on its gradual accumulation and not trying to wait that 

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:45.260
 Today will be a trend day (shock day). 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.750
 If the shock day is, then I will see it, then it is good. 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.862
 It will be a surprise for me, it will be nice and he 

00:05:51.862 --> 00:05:53.410
 will make a lot of money in trading. 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.390
 But do not sit and wait for it every day, and every 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.030
 your deal, when you enter the market, think that it 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.330
 can be a big deal. 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.860
 Do not expect much. 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.670
 Great expectations in trading play against you. 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.410
 Either have no expectations, or have small, 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.810
 small expectations, then you will be more flexible. 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.750
 If you have big ambitions, big expectations from the deal 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.780
 or from trading day or from trading week, then this 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.470
 The psychology of trading will work against you. 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.720
 You can not be flexible, and this, on the contrary, only 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.560
 can cause you to earn nothing. 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.340
 Therefore, do not focus on big deals where you 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.600
 you can raise the stop loss / take profit ratio 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.880
 1: 8, 1:15, 1:20. 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.340
 If such a trading day comes, and you will do it 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.940
 - OK. 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.340
 But do not wait for him, do not accentuate him. 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.680
 Make money in trading just like in real 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.680
 business. 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.860
 If you have a clothing store, you sell jeans every 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.900
 day, have a small profit. 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.720
 But in a month you will sell a lot of pairs of pants, and in the end 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.360
 all these quantities of small profits form a large 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.360
 profit. 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.551
 Therefore, focus on the slow approach, slow 

00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:16.360
 non-multiplication 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.620
 capital, not fast growth, but slow 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.430
 increment, addition. 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.860
 As in mathematics - multiplication, addition. 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.230
 Focus on addition, and let multiplication be 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.650
 for you surprise. 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.650
 So. 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.680
 With you was Dmitry Boytsov. 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.740
 My blog on trading www.dboytsov.me. 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.530
 Thanks for attention!
