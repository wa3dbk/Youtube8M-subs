00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.929
 What industry is talking about beauty in the video? 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.930
 response to that theory of good 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 paraná is the link to this video here on 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.019
 channel description 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.820
 recommend watching before watching the video is 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.369
 easy on a time and a video that comes 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.070
 running a lot on the internet and has caused 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.320
 a little headache not allowed 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.410
 This is because the students come to question 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.540
 about it I realized that many people are 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.420
 They are also questioning're going 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.530
 based on physiology and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 biochemistry 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.420
 You did not understand why you do not have 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.350
 sense this is briefly it says the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.940
 Following 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.250
 cut the carbohydrates from the first 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.320
 Meal of the day for me to climb Do not stay 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 down below and today the gaal 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.090
 this will generate a fat burning 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.090
 higher this information does not apply 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.510
 see if you make breakfast 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.000
 I do not know with this protein and fat 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.400
 inevitably activates the production of 1 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.930
 going up because it's going to be 13 in the 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.660
 need some direction 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.160
 and who will provide this signaling is 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.740
 insulin 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.900
 so if you consume protein and 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.570
 You're not going to have fat today. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.430
 because playing is he is unique and he gets one 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.050
 old only proportional 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.940
 so when you have insulin you 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.920
 Let the little cat down today, what not 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.750
 then this theory only 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.210
 would work if you only consume 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.220
 Carbs at Breakfast and Cut 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.740
 if they are the first issue of the day 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.690
 would be nonexistent then I would not stay 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.420
 low insulin level 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.780
 I remember but I did and we paid off 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.000
 explain why it can promote results 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.670
 logical but not with this theory is when 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.979
 You cut to look after 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.810
 tomorrow you decrease caloric intake 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.830
 if it was not compensated at another time 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.500
 of the day 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.899
 then decrease the caloric intake you 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.360
 can stay in the northeast you do not 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.570
 had the deficit greater than what you 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.700
 had and this will generate weight loss but 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.739
 not because I took the car taken care of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.569
 first meal of the day of the geographer 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.970
 What has this got to do with anything? 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.280
 you have only reduced the amount of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.959
 food that you put in and it 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840
 will increase the deficit speak as it goes 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.590
 create 1 and it will help you lose weight 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.269
 right 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.640
 so if you took care of the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.560
 Dinner is five in the afternoon if you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.940
 stop assaulting the refrigerator is 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.190
 dawn 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.590
 jokes aside but it works 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.530
 way if you cut 100 calories in 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.110
 any time of your day that would 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.760
 to help as much as carrying the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.019
 morning 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.900
 beauty guys this theory is not 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.630
 there is no point in cutting the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.610
 carbohydrate and keep protein and fat 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.530
 waiting for the gdf car because it will not 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.989
 stay is a given that is a bit is of 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.880
 disillusionment for those who train is that some 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.730
 studies have shown that twice the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.160
 gh production had no impact on 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 body composition, ie the diets of 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.690
 June is that you talk to 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.480
 gh doubled during the day because you 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.310
 It is a fast and even a larger period 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.650
 so it was not even a pact of 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.230
 body composition even for the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.079
 longevity and quality of life was 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.049
 Nice beauty, she's so so from there.
