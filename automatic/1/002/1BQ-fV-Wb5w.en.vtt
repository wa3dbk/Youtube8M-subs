to<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> little<00:02:55.260> bit<00:02:55.380> hard<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.800> what<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
to be a little bit hard so what I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.740 
to be a little bit hard so what I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
suggest to be in that case is to come up

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.120 
suggest to be in that case is to come up
a<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:57.989> bit<00:02:58.200> higher<00:02:58.380> when<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.709> upper<00:02:58.920> body
