have<00:02:10.069> fewer<00:02:10.369> energy<00:02:10.819> alternatives<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.050> a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
have fewer energy alternatives so a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.790 
have fewer energy alternatives so a
steady<00:02:12.470> supply<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.980> sustainable<00:02:13.730> biofuels

efficiency can only go so far and so we

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.790 
efficiency can only go so far and so we

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.870 
need to look at this alternative source

the<00:02:44.950> ground<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.490> think<00:02:45.790> all<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> lot<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.210> acres<00:02:46.480> of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
the ground I think all a lot of acres of

oil seeds in order to be able to do it

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.390 
oil seeds in order to be able to do it
100%<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.050> certainly<00:02:50.260> make<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.980> huge

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
100% but we can certainly make a huge
