needs to go a low noise power adapter

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 
needs to go a low noise power adapter
which<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.449> there's<00:00:55.320> basically<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.770> resistor<00:00:56.430> in

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
which is there's basically a resistor in

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.979 
which is there's basically a resistor in
there<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:56.940> brings<00:00:57.239> down<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> RPM<00:00:59.180> and<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
there which brings down the RPM and you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
there which brings down the RPM and you
got<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.320> typical<00:01:01.829> case<00:01:02.520> mounting<00:01:03.090> screws

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
got your typical case mounting screws

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.010 
got your typical case mounting screws
and<00:01:04.610> now<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:05.790> onto<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> fan<00:01:06.330> itself<00:01:06.689> all

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and now we're onto the fan itself all

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.380 
and now we're onto the fan itself all
three<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.560> these<00:01:07.680> fans<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.340> physically<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
three of these fans are physically the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.010 
three of these fans are physically the
same<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.409> difference<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.920> their<00:01:11.340> rpm<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
same the difference is their rpm and the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.210 
same the difference is their rpm and the

on the actual fans reduce flow

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
on the actual fans reduce flow
separation<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.630> assume<00:01:39.750> makes

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
separation which I would assume makes

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
separation which I would assume makes
them<00:01:40.560> perform<00:01:41.159> better<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.579> quieter<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.049> if

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
them perform better and quieter and if

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
them perform better and quieter and if
you<00:01:43.590> want<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> go<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> PWM<00:01:44.610> route<00:01:44.850> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you want to go the PWM route it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.450 
you want to go the PWM route it's
basically<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> same<00:01:46.130> make<00:01:47.130> sure<00:01:47.280> your

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
basically the same make sure your

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
basically the same make sure your
motherboard<00:01:47.729> fan<00:01:48.329> headers<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.079> your

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
motherboard fan headers and your

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.010 
motherboard fan headers and your
motherboard<00:01:49.740> supports<00:01:50.130> PWM<00:01:51.000> fans<00:01:51.240> remember

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
motherboard supports PWM fans remember

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.940 
motherboard supports PWM fans remember
that<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> PWM<00:01:52.920> fan<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.490> 4<00:01:54.299> pin<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:55.829> not

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that the PWM fan is 4 pin if you're not

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
that the PWM fan is 4 pin if you're not
sure<00:01:56.100> which<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.180> suggest

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
sure which one to get I would suggest

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990 
sure which one to get I would suggest
getting<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.290> Flex<00:01:58.890> version<00:01:59.430> because<00:01:59.850> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
getting the Flex version because it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.929 
getting the Flex version because it
comes<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.390> too<00:02:01.049> low<00:02:01.799> noise<00:02:02.009> adapters<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.640> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
comes with too low noise adapters so you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
comes with too low noise adapters so you
can<00:02:03.270> fine<00:02:03.990> tune<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.799> figure<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.219> which<00:02:05.430> works

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
can fine tune and figure out which works

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.330 
can fine tune and figure out which works
well<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:07.049> low<00:02:07.439> noise<00:02:07.590> adapter<00:02:08.129> at

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
well for you one low noise adapter at

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.839 
well for you one low noise adapter at
900<00:02:09.090> rpm<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:10.069> ultra-low<00:02:11.069> noise<00:02:11.099> adaptor

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
900 rpm and one ultra-low noise adaptor

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.460 
900 rpm and one ultra-low noise adaptor
that<00:02:12.000> run

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
that run

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.120 
that run
at<00:02:12.530> 700<00:02:13.100> rpm<00:02:14.470> installation<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.560> pretty<00:02:15.590> easy

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
at 700 rpm installation is pretty easy

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.740 
at 700 rpm installation is pretty easy
we're<00:02:16.400> going<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.670> installing<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.330> an

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
we're going to be installing this as an

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420 
we're going to be installing this as an
exhaust<00:02:18.170> fan<00:02:18.320> we're<00:02:18.830> going<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> need<00:02:19.160> a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
exhaust fan we're going to need a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.870 
exhaust fan we're going to need a
screwdriver<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.680> we'll<00:02:22.070> just<00:02:22.250> unscrew<00:02:22.850> the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
screwdriver and we'll just unscrew the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.360 
screwdriver and we'll just unscrew the
back<00:02:23.240> here<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:25.510> then<00:02:26.510> we'll<00:02:26.660> unplug<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.710> fan

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
back here and then we'll unplug the fan

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.700 
back here and then we'll unplug the fan
from<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.940> fan<00:02:29.120> header<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.630> we'll<00:02:30.410> remember

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
from the fan header and we'll remember

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.440 
from the fan header and we'll remember
where<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.030> notice<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.330> a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
where that is notice that that is a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
where that is notice that that is a
three<00:02:32.720> pin<00:02:34.210> so<00:02:35.210> installing<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.660> fan<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.140> pretty

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
three pin so installing a fan is pretty

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.110 
three pin so installing a fan is pretty
simple<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.250> want<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.520> make<00:02:37.610> sure<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
simple you want to make sure that the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.500 
simple you want to make sure that the
air<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.630> being<00:02:38.930> exhausted<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.240> want<00:02:41.420> to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
air is being exhausted and you want to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
air is being exhausted and you want to
make<00:02:41.630> doubly<00:02:41.990> sure<00:02:42.050> which<00:02:42.380> direction<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.280> fan

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
make doubly sure which direction the fan

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
make doubly sure which direction the fan
is<00:02:43.910> blowing<00:02:44.090> air<00:02:46.000> there<00:02:47.000> are<00:02:47.120> arrows<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
is blowing air there are arrows on the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.420 
is blowing air there are arrows on the
side<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:47.959> tell<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:48.800> really<00:02:49.280> quick

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
side that tell you but a really quick

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.290 
side that tell you but a really quick
way<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.670> go<00:02:49.880> about<00:02:49.970> it

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
way to go about it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.390 
way to go about it
is<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.900> air<00:02:51.080> gets<00:02:51.440> pushed<00:02:51.650> out<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
is that the air gets pushed out on the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.350 
is that the air gets pushed out on the
frame<00:02:52.850> or<00:02:53.120> logo<00:02:53.510> side<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.670> we'll<00:02:55.730> place<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.240> in

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
frame or logo side so we'll place it in

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.510 
frame or logo side so we'll place it in
there<00:02:56.690> get<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.500> all<00:02:57.560> nice<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:57.890> neat<00:02:58.250> we're

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
there get it all nice and neat we're

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.220 
there get it all nice and neat we're
going<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.700> be<00:02:58.760> using<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.450> rubber<00:02:59.810> mounts

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
going to be using the rubber mounts

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.470 
going to be using the rubber mounts
which<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.800> be<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> little<00:03:01.160> tricky<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.330> we'll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
which can be a little tricky so we'll

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.940 
which can be a little tricky so we'll
double<00:03:02.720> check<00:03:02.750> which<00:03:03.080> holes<00:03:03.350> we<00:03:03.560> need<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.770> put

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
double check which holes we need to put

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.270 
double check which holes we need to put
the<00:03:04.130> mounts<00:03:04.700> through<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.740> they<00:03:06.740> pretty<00:03:07.190> much

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
the mounts through and they pretty much

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.449 
the mounts through and they pretty much
just<00:03:07.730> pop<00:03:07.940> through<00:03:08.240> I<00:03:09.160> tend<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.190> pull<00:03:10.340> them

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
just pop through I tend to pull them

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.740 
just pop through I tend to pull them
through<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> pair<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.300> needle<00:03:11.630> nose

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
through with a pair of needle nose

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.580 
through with a pair of needle nose
pliers<00:03:11.780> makes<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.800> quite<00:03:13.490> easy

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.830 

and<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:17.670> we'll<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.910> plug<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.330> bad<00:03:18.599> boy

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
and then we'll just plug this bad boy

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.330 
and then we'll just plug this bad boy
into<00:03:19.530> our<00:03:19.739> fan<00:03:20.160> header<00:03:21.950> if<00:03:22.950> that's<00:03:23.160> still<00:03:23.280> a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
into our fan header if that's still a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.160 
into our fan header if that's still a
little<00:03:23.550> too<00:03:23.700> loud<00:03:23.849> for<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.660> connect

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
little too loud for you you can connect

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.960 
little too loud for you you can connect
the<00:03:25.560> low<00:03:26.190> noise<00:03:26.370> adapter<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.069> plug<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.940> back

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
the low noise adapter and plug it back

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.559 
the low noise adapter and plug it back
in<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.870> will<00:03:31.380> lower<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.770> RPM<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.610> after

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
in and that will lower the RPM and after

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.600 
in and that will lower the RPM and after
that<00:03:33.720> you're<00:03:33.900> good<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.110> go<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.410> now<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.370> have<00:03:35.580> a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
that you're good to go and now we have a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.870 
that you're good to go and now we have a
little<00:03:36.060> bit<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.480> more<00:03:36.720> quieter<00:03:37.260> PC<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.160> loud

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
little bit of a more quieter PC a loud

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.650 
little bit of a more quieter PC a loud
fan<00:03:39.209> can<00:03:39.750> actually<00:03:40.440> cause<00:03:40.950> your<00:03:41.310> fatigue<00:03:41.849> or

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
fan can actually cause your fatigue or

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.190 
fan can actually cause your fatigue or
even<00:03:42.989> damage<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.709> some<00:03:44.220> instances<00:03:45.050> some<00:03:46.050> can

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
even damage in some instances some can

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.430 
even damage in some instances some can
have<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.650> high-pitched<00:03:47.010> whine<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.440> yeah

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
have like a high-pitched whine and yeah

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.039

not<00:03:50.280> good<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.760> went<00:03:51.239> ahead<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.540> installed<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
not good I went ahead and installed the

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.370 
not good I went ahead and installed the
S<00:03:52.470> 12s<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.160> my<00:03:53.790> workstation<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.750> keep<00:03:54.900> my<00:03:55.019> vrm

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
S 12s in my workstation to keep my vrm

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.620 
S 12s in my workstation to keep my vrm
cool<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.130> generally<00:03:56.700> keep<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.450> air

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
cool and to generally keep the air

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.890 
cool and to generally keep the air
flowing<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.470> have<00:03:59.220> them<00:03:59.340> set<00:03:59.610> at<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.299> low<00:04:00.450> RPM

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
flowing I have them set at the low RPM

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.160 
flowing I have them set at the low RPM
and<00:04:01.200> yeah<00:04:02.040> they<00:04:02.340> do<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> great<00:04:03.120> job<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.780> they're

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
and yeah they do a great job and they're

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.089 
and yeah they do a great job and they're
pretty<00:04:04.860> quiet<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:06.540> barely<00:04:06.840> hear<00:04:06.989> them<00:04:07.110> an

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
pretty quiet can barely hear them an

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.309 
pretty quiet can barely hear them an
amazing<00:04:08.519> amount<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.420> research<00:04:10.019> and

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
amazing amount of research and

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.080 
amazing amount of research and
development<00:04:10.650> goes<00:04:11.160> into<00:04:11.400> making<00:04:11.549> these<00:04:11.760> fans

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
development goes into making these fans

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.780 
development goes into making these fans
they're<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.690> pricey<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:14.220> get<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> six

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
they're a bit pricey but you get a six

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.810 
they're a bit pricey but you get a six
year<00:04:15.120> warranty<00:04:15.630> with<00:04:15.780> them<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.639> yeah<00:04:17.639> their

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
year warranty with them and yeah their

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.840 
year warranty with them and yeah their
performance<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.340> can't<00:04:20.340> say<00:04:20.700> anything

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
performance is just I can't say anything

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.180
