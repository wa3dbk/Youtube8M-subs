00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.010
 after having done the 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.869
 previous configuration of the system we are going to 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.930
 start doing the part of the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.160
 network configuration so it's 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 important to have the following 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 elements 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.100
 the configuration status page of 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.070
 network to deal with the elements 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.290
 that we're going to start setting up ok 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.330
 then let's move on to the part of 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.330
 menus we are going to give a click 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.970
 and we are going to enter the third option that 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.970
 it is network and ports we give a click 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.920
 and we're going to start configuring the part 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.680
 of the ip address here we are going to enter 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 here the section that says automatic and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 let's go into what network says 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.130
 standard done this let's select 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.910
 the d section that says standard network 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.910
 we click 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.080
 and we're going to start configuring the part 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.880
 of network only we are going to go to the part 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.020
 which says standard network configuration 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 we click 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.480
 and we're going to go to the third part that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.680
 called the tcp diagonal address and p 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.340
 click 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.020
 and we're going to start defining the values 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.840
 we start with the first ip address 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.590
 we click 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.420
 automatically in the machine we will 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.790
 give a predetermined address and pre 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.920
 so this does not mean that it's 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.759
 the correct one let's start taking the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.100
 ip address that comes in the segment of 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.470
 the page that we take out the address 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 original must be segment 1073 point 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 1.2 52 then we go to the device 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.450
 we type 10 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 73 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:13.580
 we move on to the next 1 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.580
 and we went to the fourth object that is 252 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.220
 done this let's give send button 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.050
 Later we will start loading 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.420
 the same network mask we give a click 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.070
 and we are going to copy the same one that has the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 page of the equipment removed 2 55.2 55.2 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.820
 55.0 then we go back to 1 and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.820
 we configure 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.290
 done this we send 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.800
 then we started doing the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.320
 gateway configuration we click 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.170
 and in the same way we will take the value 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.330
 default of the sheet tells us that 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:10.890
 is the segment 10.73 point 1.2 we go to 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.890
 menu and we configure iess 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.890
 73 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.920
 one 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.920
 2 having done this we follow up 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.980
 then perform the configuration of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.480
 tcp / ip the network more than your network and are 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.459
 the only values that we're going to start 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.680
 charge for this part whereby 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.560
 after doing this we can talk 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.890
 backward or just give button 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.890
 start 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.549
 it is important to mention that we should 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.709
 configure the lack of the dns is 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.230
 primary and secondary because without this 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.330
 configuration we're probably going to have 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.330
 remote access to the multifunctional
