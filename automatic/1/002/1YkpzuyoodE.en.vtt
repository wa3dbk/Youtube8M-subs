00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.210
 It's been my house, fine, it's been a while. 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.670
 I do not record nail tutorial and I solved 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 record this because several friends still 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.900
 ask me how to do this effect as 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.790
 leader and today I'm going to teach a trick 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.859
 first I need an enamel on the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.619
 day 11 with glitter nude I'm 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.480
 using in tala fan to have the pink candy side 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.869
 and the one with glitter 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'm using the dollar today it 's fashion 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.090
 caries is the most work and if it is impala 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.700
 varnishes work a ketone one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.739
 sponge of that of passing the shadow of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.579
 I look at the one who comes from 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 makeup knows English girl right there 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.200
 going here the trick cotton straws 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200
 and only 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.090
 first I'll pass two hands of the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.760
 enamel where there were no people or 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 another of them living right with him he has 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.840
 I taught here also in the channel but this 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.330
 tip with the shadow sponge she 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.830
 makes it easier for those who have no practice 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.840
 to do the fingernail 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.770
 I am now passing the second layer of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.509
 enamel and every layer I step onto 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 I'm going to make it easier, too. 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.240
 itu around there now with glitter 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 You can use the color you want, I guess. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.970
 that this shade of green looks pretty good 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.310
 the most honorable di was also intense in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 golden does not look beautiful 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 and then I'm tapping on the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.780
 sponge over the tip of the nail is 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.009
 when you have to be with you places 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.729
 a little more she 's fine 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.720
 little woman and then you give 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:57.259
 little smacks and then you pat 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.259
 on the tip of the nail resting the glitter 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.399
 to reach the director did not go almost 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.429
 sponge is much easier to apply to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.379
 her than with the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.599
 enamel understood as already shown in 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.660
 other you do is that he sees the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.860
 gymkhana debate 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.530
 then the glitter it's fit 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.640
 it was not going to be good 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.370
 it's much easier to do things 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.860
 sponjinha people then have difficulty 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.330
 I do it right now with the enamel but who 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.870
 have difficulty doing with the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.940
 sponges that is a great tip and all 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.410
 world at home with those makeup today 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.260
 Who does not use it that much? 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.200
 then I went through that glow and now with 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 a cotton scoop and acetone just clean 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.710
 Every little corner of glitter that's left is 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.840
 chatinho de pauli will have okay but nothing 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.850
 that with patience you can not and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.510
 It's like this, I hope you have 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.840
