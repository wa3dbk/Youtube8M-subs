I want to the amplifiers this is the
Eclipse<00:03:07.510> dear<00:03:08.099> 6213<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.709> basically<00:03:11.920> a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
Eclipse dear 6213 and it's basically a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.050 
Eclipse dear 6213 and it's basically a
full-range<00:03:12.849> class<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.480> app<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.819> pushes

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
full-range class the app and it pushes

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.410 
full-range class the app and it pushes
out<00:03:16.379> 250<00:03:17.379> watts<00:03:17.940> per<00:03:18.940> channel

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.140 

it's<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:24.050> two<00:03:24.260> channel<00:03:24.290> amplifier<00:03:27.910> does<00:03:28.910> have

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's a two channel amplifier does have

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:39.840 
it's a two channel amplifier does have
quite<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.510> high<00:03:29.870> current<00:03:30.230> rule<00:03:30.590> at<00:03:31.280> 100<00:03:31.700> amps

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.030 

basically<00:03:40.690> your<00:03:40.960> adjustments<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.800> side

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
basically your adjustments on that side

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:53.030 
basically your adjustments on that side
there<00:03:44.700> go<00:03:45.700> play<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.000> terminals

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.759 

now<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.730> subwoofer<00:03:54.390> amplifier<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.379> I'll<00:03:55.650> be

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
now the subwoofer amplifier that I'll be

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.190 
now the subwoofer amplifier that I'll be
easily<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.129> system<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.700> alpines<00:03:57.530> Mr<00:03:58.530> dm500<00:04:00.200> and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
easily in system is alpines Mr dm500 and

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.550 
easily in system is alpines Mr dm500 and
then<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.890> Class<00:04:02.099> D<00:04:02.129> amplifier<00:04:02.609> that

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
then this is a Class D amplifier that

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.460 
then this is a Class D amplifier that
term<00:04:04.560> has<00:04:05.480> 500<00:04:06.480> watts<00:04:08.540> are<00:04:09.540> missing<00:04:10.200> two<00:04:10.319> to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
term has 500 watts are missing two to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:20.140 
term has 500 watts are missing two to
Williams

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.600 

now<00:04:20.780> there's<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.320> little<00:04:21.530> amplified<00:04:22.190> control

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
now there's a little amplified control

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.930 
now there's a little amplified control
here<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.060> works<00:04:23.270> for<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.630> m500<00:04:24.759> now<00:04:25.759> that

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
here that works for the m500 now that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.600 
here that works for the m500 now that
basically<00:04:26.330> does<00:04:26.600> all<00:04:26.810> your<00:04:26.840> parametric

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
basically does all your parametric

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.020 
basically does all your parametric
equalizer<00:04:29.139> Tom<00:04:30.139> alignment<00:04:30.650> phase<00:04:31.190> level

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
equalizer Tom alignment phase level

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.100 
equalizer Tom alignment phase level
anymore<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.330> just<00:04:35.509> makes<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.810> little<00:04:36.020> bit

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
anymore so it just makes a little bit

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.810 
anymore so it just makes a little bit
easier<00:04:36.229> in<00:04:36.500> tuning<00:04:36.830> inside<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.280> cabin<00:04:37.610> rather

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
easier in tuning inside the cabin rather

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.460 
easier in tuning inside the cabin rather
than<00:04:38.030> gone<00:04:38.630> back<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.020> forth<00:04:39.850> from<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.000> boot

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.520 

now<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.100> speakers<00:04:46.610> i'll<00:04:46.730> be<00:04:46.850> using<00:04:47.090> is

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
now the speakers i'll be using is

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.240 
now the speakers i'll be using is

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.260 

yeah<00:06:41.040> then<00:06:41.220> clothes<00:06:41.430> that<00:06:41.640> I've<00:06:41.760> built<00:06:41.970> for

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
yeah then clothes that I've built for

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.230 
yeah then clothes that I've built for
it's<00:06:42.390> a<00:06:42.660> sealed<00:06:43.290> one<00:06:43.620> point<00:06:43.950> one<00:06:44.160> cubic<00:06:44.550> foot

so it will work really well with you

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.330 
so it will work really well with you
with<00:06:50.400> the<00:06:50.490> Boston<00:06:51.440> those<00:06:52.440> pads<00:06:52.740> you<00:06:52.920> can<00:06:53.040> see

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
with the Boston those pads you can see

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.870 
with the Boston those pads you can see
inside<00:06:53.700> their<00:06:54.030> focal<00:06:54.810> plane<00:06:55.020> champ<00:06:55.820> so<00:06:56.820> it

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
inside their focal plane champ so it

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.820 
inside their focal plane champ so it
just<00:06:56.910> helps<00:06:57.390> with<00:06:57.510> reflections<00:06:58.140> internal<00:06:58.680> of

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
just helps with reflections internal of

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.420 
just helps with reflections internal of
the<00:06:58.980> box<00:07:02.540> all<00:07:03.540> the<00:07:03.720> edges<00:07:04.050> have<00:07:04.230> been<00:07:04.530> silicon

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
the box all the edges have been silicon

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.780 
the box all the edges have been silicon
as<00:07:06.180> well<00:07:06.420> as<00:07:06.600> glued<00:07:07.410> when<00:07:08.100> putting<00:07:08.310> the<00:07:08.490> MDF

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
as well as glued when putting the MDF

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.030 
as well as glued when putting the MDF
panels<00:07:09.150> together<00:07:09.770> so<00:07:10.770> it's<00:07:10.860> completely

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
panels together so it's completely

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:19.190 
panels together so it's completely
airtight<00:07:16.820> you<00:07:17.820> can<00:07:18.090> see<00:07:18.270> by<00:07:18.450> the<00:07:18.510> screws<00:07:18.900> here

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
airtight you can see by the screws here

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:36.770 
airtight you can see by the screws here
it's<00:07:19.380> been<00:07:19.950> put<00:07:20.160> together<00:07:20.340> quite<00:07:20.730> well

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.030 

so<00:07:37.410> that's<00:07:37.560> basically<00:07:37.710> the<00:07:38.040> system<00:07:38.460> there

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.040 
so that's basically the system there

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.410 
so that's basically the system there
i'll<00:07:41.040> be<00:07:41.190> sure<00:07:41.370> to<00:07:41.400> post<00:07:41.550> up<00:07:41.850> another<00:07:42.150> video

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:42.420 
i'll be sure to post up another video

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.690 
i'll be sure to post up another video
once<00:07:42.660> it's<00:07:42.840> all<00:07:42.990> installed<00:07:46.370> this<00:07:47.370> will<00:07:47.580> be

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.700 
once it's all installed this will be

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.129 
once it's all installed this will be
used<00:07:47.940> in<00:07:48.210> sound<00:07:49.139> quality<00:07:49.290> competition<00:07:50.040> so

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:51.139 
used in sound quality competition so

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:57.940 
used in sound quality competition so
give<00:07:52.139> it<00:07:52.169> a<00:07:52.290> bit<00:07:52.440> of<00:07:52.470> cheer<00:07:52.770> and<00:07:52.919> see<00:07:53.040> how<00:07:53.190> ago
