00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 Fuschini 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.049
 sure you want I wanted you to see the juice 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.030
 that I do the morning that the car 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.250
 here because this way I put the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.250
 wake up at 7 sells me at 7 15 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.050
 I have to call the siri make up and the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.340
 last five minutes rieti does trick 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.720
 so this is the trick that i do 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.510
 I do every morning in five minutes 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.340
 well intend to do the race and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.980
 just for the needs I have 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.789
 need five minutes to wear makeup 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.010
 so basically this is a trick 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.570
 fast cute that I like to wear not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 that I feel at ease and that it lasts all 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.340
 the day because I am then warm headlights 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 about 12 hours because they are alone at 9 am 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 at 19 and then two hours to go e 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 come back with the twelve hours of time off 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.890
 home to a degree when a home is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 still truncated almost perfectly 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.200
 because in any case all the products that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 use is all contained 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.809
 so here are very strong advertisements 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.119
 occult that star then choice of manes 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.009
 I wonder if one day he organizes I don't say 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.720
 these things 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:14.549
 in short, the products I will use for this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:22.670
 videos are types to take the browser 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:27.140
 clear reader a foundation in the tub 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 long hot I don't watch the video 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.390
 a base that I put a car for 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.189
 eyebrows a single brush for mixed 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.759
 but obviously we just need to have to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 to have 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.579
 we have to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 three hundred beauties and the naked 2 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.310
 the choice aimed at all these products 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 I will use them and I will obviously use the brush 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.929
 only two which is very convenient so me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.130
 I start video I guarantee you that 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.210
 there is absolutely none 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.950
 interruption that is probably below 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.929
 I show also makes our products 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.789
 when it fades on the table because of me 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.860
 I want to show that a tube of five 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.420
 minutes I hope this 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.420
 you like makeup and there is a party 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.660
 first of all the base eye shadow 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.310
 then steen on the entire eyelid a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.110
 champagne-colored eyeshadow schiller this 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.150
 it is a verb verb and it is enough 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 unobtrusive I don't want anything to shoot her 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.489
 chante also because it is a trick from 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.489
 day 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.450
 now I go immediately to do some 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.450
 highlighting with a pink shimmer color 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.310
 clear goes to apply on the arch 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.090
 eyebrows and internal corner 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.489
 eye 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.500
 don't worry if you lose a bit 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.060
 down to rape him because 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.060
 then we will correct with the concealer 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.280
 with the round brush part of the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.500
 nic and two brush 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.090
 I'm going to take a tease is a light brown 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.370
 neutral of those I like so much 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.370
 I go to highlight the fold 3 2 eyelids 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.630
 with the flat side of the brush of 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.460
 nic 2 used cutting are a 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.700
 draw a similar eyeliner line 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.290
 with the black mat eye shadow taken in 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.420
 just a little at a time so at least not 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
 lived he will wear his cheeks and even if there 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.930
 dirty or you can always clean them 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.810
 later having never done it before 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.830
 the eyes of the valley this is a 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.390
 tactical trick if you make the line 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.580
 sufficiently thin and if not 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.190
 you will stretch more than half an eye not you 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.160
 will absolutely see that it is not eye liner 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.690
 pencil will only put the definition 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.140
 cute cuddly bellocchio 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.140
 I 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:29.970
 obviously we have to wear color 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:33.310
 black even below and now is the time 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.530
 the foundation because we give it now 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.870
 because in the meantime we could have 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.480
 remove make-up in case we put up with 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.030
 any errors with the black eye shadow that 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.290
 I still like some in the morning 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.540
 they say it should not be used in tricks 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.120
 fast but I have no black eyes 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.040
 they don't see me like that, so spend it now 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.790
 we apply the foundation with the 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.530
 concealer we might even 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.690
 correct any further burrs 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.520
 that we have committed in the part 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.520
 lower eyelid 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.780
 so it is a thing of Tactical 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.330
 obviously we have to put the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.490
 concealer foundation before 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.650
 mascara otherwise it would melt 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.200
 would create panda- like dark circles 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.570
 then follow these steps and you will have 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.280
 the fastest makeup in the west 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.900
 I tried them for mornings and mornings 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.560
 this is the absolute cooperation 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.560
 best 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.840
 so here is always with the beauty 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.730
 blender I'm going to give the light collector 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.250
 and under the eye a little because not 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.250
 we want to appear covered with greasepaint 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.270
 then 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.450
 I 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.450
 anything 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.550
 thank you 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.900
 and now as I told you before 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.550
 end after the concealer we put the 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.790
 mascara that absolutely can not 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.560
 missing in every make up at least for me 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.560
 without mascara in the pipeline 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.090
 you know 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.410
 6 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.270
 another step for us very important a 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.400
 fill eyebrows with uses 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.949
 a very clear pencil 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.849
 so at least I don't risk committing 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.849
 Incorrigible errors 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.270
 and then just not to look like a 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.789
 corpse and seem a tad thinner 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.830
 I'm going to do a very fast touring 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.210
 taking very little land on a 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:12.789
 round brush 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:16.180
 et voila ok if you liked this 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:17.740
 video put a nice like because 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.860
 I was good, it took me five 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.869
 precise minutes and nothing this goal 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.749
 finished now you just have to settle down 

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:28.770
 hair and go out for an amazing one 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:28.770
 day I hope 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.410
 the return of the other kindergartens then 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.140
 let us see how it was given yesterday to 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.910

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.720
