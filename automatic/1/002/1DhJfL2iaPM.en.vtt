first<00:01:17.130> couple<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.429> years<00:01:17.490> you'd<00:01:17.789> have<00:01:17.909> chance

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
first couple of years you'd have chance

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.090 
first couple of years you'd have chance
to<00:01:18.270> focus<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> research<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:19.799> as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to focus on your research and then as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.919 
to focus on your research and then as
you<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.700> throughout<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.060> fellowship<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
you go throughout the fellowship you

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.600 
you go throughout the fellowship you
progressively<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.649> more<00:01:22.860> responsibility

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
progressively have more responsibility

most exciting things I've found about
working<00:02:28.620> here

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
working here

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.780 
working here
because<00:02:30.360> many<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.930> today's<00:02:31.550> societal<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
because many of today's societal and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.320 
because many of today's societal and
economic<00:02:33.000> challenges

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.670 

I<00:02:39.330> met<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.990> chemist<00:02:40.470> buying<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:41.100> Mac<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.550> guy<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
I met a chemist buying for Mac the guy a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.080 
I met a chemist buying for Mac the guy a
biochemist<00:02:43.680> an<00:02:43.800> engineer<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.910> could

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
biochemist an engineer and we could

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.270 
biochemist an engineer and we could
build<00:02:45.240> together<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.530> diversity<00:02:46.770> is<00:02:47.069> one

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
build together so the diversity is one

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.010 
build together so the diversity is one
of<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> main<00:02:47.640> attractions<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
of the main attractions I think the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.840 
of the main attractions I think the
technological<00:02:49.709> support<00:02:50.100> here<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.610> also

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
technological support here is also

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.120 
technological support here is also
excellent<00:02:51.330> leads<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.500> invests<00:02:53.010> in

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
excellent leads really invests in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.760 
excellent leads really invests in
technology<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:54.239> invests<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.840> people<00:02:54.870> there's

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
technology it invests in people there's

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.990 
technology it invests in people there's
everything<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.310> could<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.880> know
