00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
 I think it helps, I do not think what you get 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.589
 a little time to hide the escalation 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.500
 you hide the ladder is and avoid to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.150
 let the team prepare better for 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 try to surprise us try to score 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.650
 we think that this is valid 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 sometimes it is necessary to create this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.779
 ministry is to start well out in front 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 huh 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.800
 I think it's fundamental to give 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.080
 Quite tranquility in the matches 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 all the games that we went out front and the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.010
 people managed to keep and even managed to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 enlarge the board 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 then you need to get ahead and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.160
 start well games that we are 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 starting a little below what the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 So I guess that's what it's all about. 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.550
 alert they are from here now in this game 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 tomorrow we can get on well and with 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 sure the same three points as the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.329
 people will dispute tomorrow forum fear that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.129
 We lost to the bridge so I 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.059
 I think with four points on the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.129
 accumulation of points 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 we have accumulated a greater 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.579
 number of possible points 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.870
 button on the front with these 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.519
 goals 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.400
 I think those three games already 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.770
 They passed by sure, we'll go. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 try to recover up front only that the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.500
 lost people recover more 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 so we have to go in search of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.750
 new pressure points is normal 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.409
 flamengo can not be near and zac 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 were only three rounds the club I 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 I even mentioned here that it could be 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 champion is also in the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 relegation is the beginning the beginning but 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 know you can improve the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.479
 people can put Flemish in a 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 better situation 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.390
 I think all players have to 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.400
 be prepared for opportunity 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.460
 It's already stirring because we have criteria 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.280
 of which I particularly agree 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 I think today it is impossible to play three 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.149
 games followed at a high level 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.790
 football today has evolved a lot 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.710
 fast and very dynamic and we are beings 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.780
 humans can not keep up the same 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.000
 level in all matches then 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.939
 times it is necessary to change one of the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.100
 players to give some rest is 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.369
 unfortunately the result is not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.259
 it's happening it was happening 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.959
 sure everyone is talking about that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.239
 that it was necessary for exchanges that the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.920
 Flemish team is not falling the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.780
 yield is not falling level 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.800
 performance but it is necessary sometimes 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.850
 exchange to give a greater dynamism in our 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.569
 play mode 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.100
 it wears out but I think it 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.930
 Now, we have to forget all of this. 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 I think it's an exhausting hour of travel. 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.470
 We have to travel to the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 4 hours from where you live as 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.190
 was the judge out 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.769
 but the plane ride the fast and 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.970
 I think this does not influence much. 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.610
 of course we wanted to be playing 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.489
 in our stadium to play here on the river 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.830
 with support from our supporter and 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.350
 is concentrating where it has always concentrated 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.830
 but as this is not happening to 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.810
 You have to follow the orders to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.810
 to travel to the province all the teams that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.540
 play against flamengo comes to give 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.860
 life come here to play as if it were the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.290
 last match of the career 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.420
 This has always been so we have 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.769
 that's it and prepared for the worst 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.320
 playing in Flemish is of the impression that 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.209
 all the players you signed 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.570
 I have to go to the Flemish. 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.609
 here waiting for pressure be it for good 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.730
 or evil and unfortunately we are 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.989
 passing through situation is that I say that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.420
 is an alert situation so that the 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.430
 people can improve and we have 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.140
 aware of it then we seek 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.390
 this pressure will be shared by 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.030
 So that on behalf of the team can win 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.910
 is also every day is all work all 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.269
 the repetition and we will insist on it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.950
 we will insist on repetition to 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.660
 we can improve can return 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.609
 to make more goals 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.280
 I think it was a relief this game there 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.540
 who had already made two matches not 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.250
 had scored goals 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.569
 our team is not to be left undone 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.890
 Then I hope that we can 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.510
 start well make the first goal for 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.400
 try to enlarge the board 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.370
 yes but very difficult playing this game 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.709
 same 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.640
 criciúma uses very well the house factor 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.080
 the stadium will be so difficult 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.880
 how the nautical bet against the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.710
 nautical most will be our first 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.260
 Hot book is what most people like 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.440
 hopes to play again in rio de janeiro 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.050
 in our house and the maracanã and I think 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.160
 that the fan misses us 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.370
 players too 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.820
 so we'll try to finish this 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.740
 phase well for qq at the premiere i 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.780
 I think it was as Curitiba us 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.780
 can play in the maracana with full house
