00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.090 
deal if it isn't just go ahead and go
through<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.560> your<00:01:46.740> three<00:01:47.220> strokes<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:49.100> then

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
through with your three strokes and then

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
through with your three strokes and then
after<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> finish<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.540> can

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
after you finish with that you can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
after you finish with that you can
really<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.200> through<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.560> third<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.070> you'd

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
really go through with a third if you'd

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.730 
really go through with a third if you'd
like<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.729> add<00:01:54.360> another<00:01:54.689> color<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> little

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
like and add another color to the little

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
like and add another color to the little
cloud<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.079> kind<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
cloud there but it could get kind of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
cloud there but it could get kind of
thick<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.950> too<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.700> quite<00:01:59.850> nice<00:02:00.170> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
thick so too is actually quite nice so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
thick so too is actually quite nice so
go<00:02:01.320> ahead<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.979> favorite<00:02:02.460> top<00:02:02.729> coat<00:02:02.759> I'm

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200

barielle to nail growth activate or not

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260 
barielle to nail growth activate or not
sure<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.720> top<00:02:10.289> coat<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.849> appropriate<00:02:11.849> but

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
sure if it's top coat of appropriate but

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.800 
sure if it's top coat of appropriate but
I<00:02:12.569> wanted<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> give<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.319> go

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
I wanted to give it a go

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.440 
I wanted to give it a go
and<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:14.319> how<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.770> works<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.430> apply<00:02:16.209> your

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.300 
and see how that works but apply your
favorite<00:02:16.569> top<00:02:16.959> coat<00:02:16.989> for<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.739> nice<00:02:17.950> shine

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
favorite top coat for that nice shine

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.190 
favorite top coat for that nice shine
and<00:02:18.670> it'll<00:02:18.880> kind<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.239> seal<00:02:19.480> all<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.780> different

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and it'll kind of seal all the different

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
and it'll kind of seal all the different
layers<00:02:20.319> together<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:22.270> did<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.750> manicure
