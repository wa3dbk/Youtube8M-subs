00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 He used his parents 50 million years ago . 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.170
 The middle is strategic. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 Agricultural Revolution This production goes up here 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.480
 To the nation that self-property should go to the child with his own blood 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.640
 Enter 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 The contents of the point when the ruler of the keisoko act before the act 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.990
 Ask God. But there's a problem here. 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.559
 I have destroyed the kingdom and the kingdom of the king. 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:41.129
 But this happens to be interpreted 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:45.140
 What is the concept that came out to explain that a thousand people were cut ? 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.140
 That's right there. 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.410
 U 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.760
 Oh, hello. 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.960
 It was a lot of work. 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:17.050
 Was there anything uncomfortable to come to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:21.370
 Even though I have some inconveniences, what I have to solve is reincarnation . 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:27.820
 It's not really a ceiling in time. 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:30.850
 Humanities should not be written much in such a system, and should be active under the system. 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.890
 Well, I've done this before. 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 uh 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.930
 That 's what we learn. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.930
 What is the primary meaning of what you learn? 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.060
 How does learning work? 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:57.210
 The most basic meaning is imitation, so even when you study 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 The most basic reason for the letter is imitation. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 Let's do it. 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:12.090
 So when we say we learn, we always learn imitation. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:15.870
 Put it on the target and follow it. Now that's what we're trying to imitate 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.769
 Target The model 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:27.840
 We made it, or we made it before someone else. 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:32.819
 Another made by us Oh we made it by one other member 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.650
 Putting it in the system and doing it accordingly 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:43.620
 Now that we study, we learn. 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.930
 Would the human person making him the target of learning two people to learn it So 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.780
 It's humanity. 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.370
 Creator 1 It's the end of learning a user 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.940
 I'm not treating you. 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.710
 And that itneungeo learning is just one place that I'm in Rome 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.940
 So when we say we learn to sense, we're going to learn to keep living for one euro. 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:14.490
 Otherwise joggers will once'll gotta humanity 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:19.650
 But gohal away Expecting that 12 is the spot 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.680
 It's not easy to be scared. 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.850
 Sometimes 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.370
 Sometimes this is not my adverb I used wrong 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.370
 Very often Very often 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.920
 He's become a toddler of his tools. 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:46.100
 The power of reference in the process of imitation 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:55.880
 The Good Fire of Creation 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 What this is going to turn into things you can feel the flicker of humanity squirming 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.240
 It's an introductory orientation to the length 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.710
 That's a humanistic insight. 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:12.170
 Through the process of making the factory 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:14.900
 I actually believed that you could have the power to act. 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.540
 So, Nozai criticizes 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:24.700
 Not on Activity 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.700
 It will be open to us through this hat . 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.020
 Confucius 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.260
 I emphasize blame. 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.450
 The first letter in the column 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.870
 In the following 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.870
 No , no, no, no, no, no. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:57.350
 Haha default is to know well the second system do well out more 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:05:02.750
 This may be the first of the word, but give the deer sseuk Department skiing Analects 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.310
 What reason for coming to the big tree is the most important concept to you over the whole of you 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:10.070
 It's not. 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:16.580
 It's a lesson . Repeat in imitation. 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:19.580
 By the way, Confucius's repeated training in imitation is the way to go. 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.650
 I did not mean to say this. 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.650
 What does the factory say ? 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:32.160
 The greatest scriptures in that era when Confucius lived 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.490
 The highest level of high e- book philosophy 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:41.690
 0 cd 5 pm followed Format 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:44.330
 That's why Confucius says, 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.569
 Out of politics 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.230
 If you do not handle all the little things right 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.009
 Hey cupcakes were forces 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.360
 Is there Athos ? 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:06:01.849
 Through the process of making Confucius 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:04.669
 I actually believed that you could have the power to act. 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:10.659
 Right way 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.659
 Confucius has this system of one 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.820
 Fortune 1 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:24.200
 Learn to open people 쩝 attitude no 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.200
 I did not expect it to end up in an open attitude. 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:33.650
 What Confucius is aiming at is 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:40.670
 In the end, what we wanted to go was the creative origin that we could do 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:41.600
 It believed in the factory, but oh so thin that it is to be composed of a single system 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.850
 Way 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:50.860
 The market is so lonely, Nozagai criticizes it. 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.860
 It's the first letter in Lok Daekuk. 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.380
 Tojo or 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.430
 An end appearing in the Tao Te Ching bueoyo car because the most important thing that's wrong 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.430
 Yes. Yes. 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:16.430
 This is the story when Nozai criticizes Confucius. 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:20.430
 Aesthetics 1 is to make things better every day. 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:26.819
 Strengthening something every day 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:28.020
 In other words, I do my way of doing the latitude stone 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:33.580
 This 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:35.639
 One hand to take away a little each day 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:41.789
 To do something 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:47.249
 In other words, you have to look at the world when you see it. 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:52.430
 I believe that it is my belief system 

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:52.430
 I'm going to take it down, reduce it, weaken it .
