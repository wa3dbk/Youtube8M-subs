00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.690
 I know what they say about them but 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.470

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.449

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.850
 I always said sea creatures 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.250
 its a spiteful monster but long 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.360

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.240
 that I know 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.250
 poor little green brothers our hearts 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990
 beat in the same rhythm and 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.650
 Finally, the same green blood 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.650
 through our veins 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.729
 you have to be said marine creatures 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.190
 sneaky and lying but laguna 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.020
 is so caring faithful and sincere 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.170
 how to wish a front only 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.170
 can 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.730
 and that's what makes you finished higher 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.680
 was too cerebral to rum was quite natural 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.050

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.970

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.310

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 please do what you want to do 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.790
 these ancient obsolete prejudices 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.590
 hold tight 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.870

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.030
