00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.610
 one has your identity 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.819
 your touch 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.819
 almost a personality 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 but together they are capable of such a result 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.189
 is a mixture of sounds that the sensibility of vânia perceive soon 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.520
 besides the sensation of the invasion makes the party 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.580
 literally it appears the marker 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.160
 at the same time he 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.249
 the taste for music is in 70 of the eyes in the room 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.879
 for this reason, an electron attentive to the details of tradition in dealing with 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.600
 sound between laughs on the very cool flute 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.490
 a perception here before the question 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.320
 but how to carry these sounds through the electromagnetic accounts of tv 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 even if the audio capture is done on several channels today the samu 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.460
 came to the house in two sterile ways the analog TV mode only allows the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 these two paths 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 but with digital tv the quality of what you hear and will improve a lot let's go 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.270
 enjoy the basic equipment of a home theater like this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.460
 if today I am a mirror of environment sensation activity using the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.119
 left side audio boxes imagine how they are coming out 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.750
 Also from here on your back from above will give you better understanding 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.880
 is called al with 5 points added and you can listen at the same time that comes 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.260
 of these five channels 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.670
 and this one that highlighted shadows 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.770
 with the possibility also of having these same resources or bad of original 'of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 film 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.430
 there is the possibility for example in the case of a film 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.679
 the sound 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:13.830
 from the senate blog 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.379
 in the end he told 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.430
 attended the regional also be seen in the field 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.159
 and the possibility of having multiple languages 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.159
 reformulated 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.670
 in this simulation of what a bucket in digital tv would be 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.099
 the same orchestra you watched closely is now on your TV screen with 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 the quality similar to what she accompanied live 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.900
 it's March 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.689
 perfect still coming from fearing for vice of each instrument and first 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.189
 placement is legal 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.189
 It's the sound of cinema inside that house. 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:59.229
 nothing better than being here in the projection room to explain to 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.589
 you what the audi a5 pointed out that they make up action none of the four 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.589
 scepter corners 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.040
 imagine what is the expectation of who is out there and by pm 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.110
 the pilot warns the pilot to stay in front of the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.080
 the woman now he has returned to the camera a significant part 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.949
 of 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.459
 in the area the lawyer 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.589
 It's a real shame 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:36.279
 she is 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.229
 molly is a very beautiful thing with him 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.069
 there is no rush 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.159
 Let's try to get in there. 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.759
 Dona ilda alone will feel now what is the immensity of the cinema 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.629
 beyond the river 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.450
 any transaction 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.680
 o são paulo sp 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.799
 so rudimentary 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.180
 the club received a proposal for the tremor in france 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.419
 wonderful to try here 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.169
 for what and for what? 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.169
 4 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.079
 what she says the ferdinando who does not see perceives with another sense the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.079
 are for him in an era of accumulated loss 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.840
 this question 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.039
 running 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.749
 people screaming 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.139
 ferdinando feels what happened 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.759
 the adept magic of what digital tv will now allow
