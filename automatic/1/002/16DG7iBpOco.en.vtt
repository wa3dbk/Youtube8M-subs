 150 grams of other utensils are

 blender bowl spoon rubber spatula 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.640
 plate for oven and pyro tubs first thing 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 that we are going to be is to beat the butter 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.980
 with the sugar to form a cream 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 we beat well 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.280
 once it has formed cream 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.340
 what we are going to do is incorporate the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 vanilla 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.240
 and the egg 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.220
 we mix well 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.659
 we incorporated the areas previously 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.659
 chopped 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.940
 we beat 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.119
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.119
 add the baking powder 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.870
 together with the flour 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.050
 and let's interspersed with milk 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.930
 what is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.590
 once we have ready this what 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.030
 what we are going to do is put them in a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.270
 plate with the pilotines for that we take 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.160
 a little bit of the mixture 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:04.190
 and we fill the hair up to 34 this is 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.500
 because they are going to grow in the oven and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.650
 if not we will stay for 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.510
 sides 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.890
 once we have filled up to three 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.079
 rooms what we are going to do is the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.079
 origin a little the surface 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.350
 and we're going to take it to the moderate oven 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.350
 for approximately 10-15 minutes 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.000
 for the filling we will use sweet 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.760
 of milk for cream oreos topping 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.120
 states and for decoration mini short 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.930
 josh what we are going to use is bowl 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.209
 beater pastry pike beater and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.280
 spoon when they are ready 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.750
 our cupcakes we will let them cool 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.959
 and once they're cold what are we going to 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.879
 to do is with a spoon to make it 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.879
 a circle on the top 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.270
 let's dry 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.150
 a capital this we are going to reserve 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.790
 because we are going to use it to cover it 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.790
 we hold our cupcake 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.290
 We remove them all part of the center 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.800
 and once we have cupped 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.550
 our cupcake what we are going to do is 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.639
 fill it with dulce de leche we take a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.960
 little and with help to another teaspoon what 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.960
 we will put in the center 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.139
 we press well 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.180
 we review a little more 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.640
 full belly we will cover it again with 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.990
 what we had saved we repeated the 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.790
 same procedure with all 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.400
 cupcakes and now we're going to perform the 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.229
 tapping 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.990
 to do this ping the first thing that 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.310
 let's do is put the milk cream 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.310
 in a bowl 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.500
 and we will begin to beat until it is 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.500
 about to anti zinc creams 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.230
 a little bit before it gets to that 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.130
 point what we are going to do is 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.880
 add the oreo cookies 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.280
 chopped and we will continue beating now yes 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:50.580
 until you get 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.580
 a very hard consistency 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.920
 when it has reached that point what 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.780
 that we are going to be is to place it in a 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:04.690
 sleeve with pastry spout for using stepped 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.490
 smooth the boat is more like it what 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.490
 we will put in 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.360
 and we will start making our top ping 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.240
 I in this case did all the 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.240
 little stars 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.910
 and now what we are going to do is 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.010
 place a mini area on top 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.870
 well, our cupcake is ready 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.030
 I hope you liked it if it's like that
