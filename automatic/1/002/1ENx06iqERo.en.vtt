fourth and final track is a special Cup
and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.050> debut<00:00:31.289> tracks<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.669> no<00:00:33.000> clue<00:00:33.239> what

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and the debut tracks I have no clue what

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.090 
and the debut tracks I have no clue what
it<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.860> about

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it is that some people don't like about

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650 
it is that some people don't like about
this<00:00:35.250> track<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.450> pretty

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this track but it's actually pretty

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
this track but it's actually pretty
enjoyable<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> nice<00:00:37.739> change<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.219> scenario

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
enjoyable and a nice change of scenario

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
enjoyable and a nice change of scenario
since<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.690> only<00:00:39.719> race<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> rainbow

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
since we not only race on the rainbow

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
since we not only race on the rainbow
track<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.550> also<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.910> throw<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> space<00:00:42.660> station

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
track but also a throw a space station

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.680 
track but also a throw a space station
so<00:00:43.950> let's<00:00:44.129> learn<00:00:44.430> how<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.730> dominate<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so let's learn how to dominate on this

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
so let's learn how to dominate on this
last<00:00:45.899> track<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.100> take<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> look

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
last track now we're gonna take a look

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.860 
last track now we're gonna take a look
at<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> fastest<00:00:48.120> base<00:00:48.270> route<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> most

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
at the fastest base route in the most

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.139 
at the fastest base route in the most
efficient<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> earn<00:00:49.770> ten<00:00:49.950> coins<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.520> say

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
efficient way to earn ten coins I say

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.490 
efficient way to earn ten coins I say
base<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> nature<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
base because this is the nature of the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
base because this is the nature of the
game<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.129> cannot<00:00:53.399> change<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.760> card

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
game you cannot change your card

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.610 
game you cannot change your card
combination<00:00:54.660> before<00:00:54.899> knowing<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.379> track

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
combination before knowing what track

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740 
combination before knowing what track
you're<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.190> dominate<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> all

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you're going to dominate for this in all

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.360 
you're going to dominate for this in all
of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> fastest<00:00:58.410> ways<00:00:58.530> route<00:00:58.770> examples<00:00:59.280> I'm

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
of the fastest ways route examples I'm

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
of the fastest ways route examples I'm
going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.000> using<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> default<00:01:00.570> card<00:01:01.020> build

going to be using the default card build
we<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.280> focus<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.820> drift<00:01:03.120> which

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
we will also focus on the drift which

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
we will also focus on the drift which
will<00:01:03.480> help<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.229> better<00:01:04.439> time<00:01:04.769> all
