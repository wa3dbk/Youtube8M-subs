00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
effects it all so here's how so you just

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.609 
effects it all so here's how so you just
need<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.789> place<00:00:21.000> them<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:22.050> which

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
need to place them so they don't which

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.310 
need to place them so they don't which
is<00:00:22.650> usually<00:00:23.400> about<00:00:23.490> two<00:00:24.480> spaces<00:00:24.810> away<00:00:25.050> from

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
