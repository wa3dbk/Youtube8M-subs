even<00:01:29.219> bother<00:01:29.310> repairing<00:01:29.880> these<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.630> I'm

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
even bother repairing these because I'm

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.130 
even bother repairing these because I'm
gonna<00:01:30.899> build<00:01:31.079> replacements<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:33.140> there

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
gonna build replacements for them there

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240 
gonna build replacements for them there
you<00:01:34.289> go

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.420 

and<00:01:39.640> if<00:01:40.510> we<00:01:42.390> click<00:01:43.390> here<00:01:43.960> back<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.160> spawning

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
and if we click here back the spawning

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.730 
and if we click here back the spawning
pool<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.540> he<00:01:46.570> only<00:01:46.780> has<00:01:46.960> one<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.260> run<00:01:47.380> left<00:01:47.590> at

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
pool so he only has one to run left at

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.219 
pool so he only has one to run left at
this<00:01:47.830> point<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:51.690> actually<00:01:52.690> should<00:01:52.960> have<00:01:53.110> just

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
this point I actually should have just

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.380 
this point I actually should have just
let<00:01:53.380> him<00:01:53.530> build<00:01:53.680> his<00:01:53.800> ERG<00:01:54.700> llings<00:01:54.910> instead<00:01:55.300> of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
let him build his ERG llings instead of

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.300 
let him build his ERG llings instead of
trying<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.720> kill<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:55.990> spawning<00:01:56.800> pool<00:01:57.130> that's

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
trying to kill the spawning pool that's

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.700 
trying to kill the spawning pool that's
kind<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.640> mistake<00:01:58.000> here<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.590> I've

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
kind of a mistake here because I've

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
kind of a mistake here because I've
already<00:01:59.830> killed<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.340> his<00:02:00.490> drones<00:02:00.820> except<00:02:01.240> for
