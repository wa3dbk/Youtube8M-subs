00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.820 

luna<00:00:02.730> gate

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
luna gate

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.440 
luna gate
you<00:00:04.250> back<00:00:04.490> to<00:00:04.790> you<00:00:04.940> to<00:00:05.149> decide

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
you back to you to decide

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.550 
you back to you to decide
got<00:00:06.600> military<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.680> a

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.560 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.500 

okay<00:00:15.560> what<00:00:15.860> you<00:00:15.950> got<00:00:16.130> here<00:00:16.430> is<00:00:16.610> the<00:00:16.880> gate

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
okay what you got here is the gate

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.140 
okay what you got here is the gate
either<00:00:18.110> leather<00:00:18.380> activates<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.250> door<00:00:19.520> hence

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
either leather activates the door hence

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.380 
either leather activates the door hence
the<00:00:20.330> name<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.810> course<00:00:21.490> so<00:00:22.490> yeah<00:00:22.700> let's<00:00:23.090> say<00:00:23.240> our

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
the name of course so yeah let's say our

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.019 
the name of course so yeah let's say our
gate<00:00:23.800> next<00:00:24.800> is<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.369> not<00:00:26.090> gate<00:00:27.880> basically<00:00:28.880> the

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
gate next is the not gate basically the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.960 
gate next is the not gate basically the
input<00:00:29.570> equals<00:00:29.869> 1<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.009> Alpha<00:00:31.310> equals<00:00:31.340> 0

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
input equals 1 and the Alpha equals 0

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.730 
input equals 1 and the Alpha equals 0
vice<00:00:32.450> versa<00:00:32.960> basically<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.500> opposite<00:00:33.920> normal

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
vice versa basically the opposite normal

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.620 
vice versa basically the opposite normal
next<00:00:36.740> is<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:36.950> nor<00:00:37.400> gate<00:00:37.430> which<00:00:38.060> is<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.300> mix

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
next is the nor gate which is a mix

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.590 
next is the nor gate which is a mix
between<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.470> knot<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.280> argit's<00:00:40.790> each

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
between the knot and the argit's each

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.850 
between the knot and the argit's each
leather<00:00:42.079> leather<00:00:42.950> will<00:00:43.370> close<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:44.090> door

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
leather leather will close the door

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.480 
leather leather will close the door
sorry<00:00:45.860> for<00:00:46.070> that<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:48.230> next<00:00:48.260> one<00:00:48.860> up<00:00:49.220> is

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
sorry for that and the next one up is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.360 
sorry for that and the next one up is
the<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.180> gate<00:00:50.630> which<00:00:51.080> requires<00:00:51.590> all<00:00:51.920> switches

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the and gate which requires all switches

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.910 
the and gate which requires all switches
to<00:00:53.090> be<00:00:53.300> activated<00:00:53.750> for<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.200> piston<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.800> be

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
to be activated for the piston to be

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.400 
to be activated for the piston to be
activated<00:00:55.610> or<00:00:55.880> whatever<00:00:56.330> it's<00:00:56.570> like<00:00:56.870> yeah

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
activated or whatever it's like yeah

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.350 
activated or whatever it's like yeah
powering<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.220> pretty<00:00:58.730> much<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.060> opposite

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
powering it's pretty much the opposite

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.410 
powering it's pretty much the opposite
of<00:00:59.480> an<00:00:59.630> target<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.380> name<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.220> because<00:01:02.090> you

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
of an target the name is and because you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.210 
of an target the name is and because you
need<00:01:02.750> both<00:01:03.970> next<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.239> NAND<00:01:06.170> gate<00:01:06.710> you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
need both next is the NAND gate you

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.690 
need both next is the NAND gate you
guessed<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:08.060> knot<00:01:08.810> /<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.560> hybrid<00:01:10.340> both

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
guessed it a knot / and hybrid both

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.030 
guessed it a knot / and hybrid both
switches<00:01:11.119> must<00:01:11.509> be<00:01:11.689> active<00:01:12.080> for<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.530> door<00:01:12.770> to

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
switches must be active for the door to

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.609 
switches must be active for the door to
close<00:01:14.110> has<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> little<00:01:15.619> pointless<00:01:16.070> example

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
close has a little pointless example

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.219 
close has a little pointless example
where<00:01:18.619> I<00:01:18.649> went<00:01:19.219> through<00:01:19.549> Lords<00:01:19.969> of

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
where I went through Lords of

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.219 
where I went through Lords of
overcomplicating<00:01:21.229> redstone<00:01:21.829> just<00:01:22.579> to

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
overcomplicating redstone just to

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.169 
overcomplicating redstone just to
activate<00:01:24.229> those<00:01:24.439> diamond<00:01:24.920> blocks<00:01:25.219> but<00:01:25.969> yeah

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
activate those diamond blocks but yeah

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.510 
activate those diamond blocks but yeah
that<00:01:26.539> shows<00:01:26.869> pretty<00:01:27.740> much<00:01:27.920> all<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.490> think

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
that shows pretty much all of it I think

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.660 
that shows pretty much all of it I think
and<00:01:29.890> next<00:01:30.890> yeah<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:31.999> is<00:01:32.119> just<00:01:32.329> all<00:01:32.569> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
and next yeah this is just all the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.270 
and next yeah this is just all the
redstone<00:01:34.670> torches<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.450> such<00:01:35.950> next<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.249> a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
redstone torches and such next is a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.950 
redstone torches and such next is a
simple<00:01:38.179> combination<00:01:38.990> lock<00:01:40.479> that's<00:01:41.479> like<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
simple combination lock that's like the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.849 
simple combination lock that's like the
dispenser<00:01:42.560> t<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.799> your<00:01:42.950> diamond<00:01:43.310> blocks<00:01:43.639> and

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
dispenser t of your diamond blocks and

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.120 
dispenser t of your diamond blocks and
blocks<00:01:45.859> don't<00:01:46.429> work<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.810> open<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:48.380> even<00:01:49.009> though

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
blocks don't work to open it even though

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.649 
blocks don't work to open it even though
it's<00:01:49.280> wouldn't<00:01:49.670> pressure<00:01:49.850> plates<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.450> not

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
it's wouldn't pressure plates is not

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.020 
it's wouldn't pressure plates is not
magic<00:01:50.859> so<00:01:51.859> you<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.069> press<00:01:52.340> on<00:01:52.369> both<00:01:52.700> pressure

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
magic so you just press on both pressure

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.969 
magic so you just press on both pressure
plates<00:01:53.389> and<00:01:53.569> it<00:01:53.659> opens<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.289> does<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> little

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
plates and it opens it does a little

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.199 
plates and it opens it does a little
like<00:01:55.969> that<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.869> now<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.799> redstone<00:01:58.310> behind<00:01:58.850> it

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
like that and now the redstone behind it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.260 
like that and now the redstone behind it
all<00:01:59.439> I<00:02:00.439> probably<00:02:01.249> completely<00:02:01.819> over

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
all I probably completely over

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.209 
all I probably completely over
complicate<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:03.109> and<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.560> actually<00:02:03.770> want

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
complicate this and if you actually want

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.309 
complicate this and if you actually want
to<00:02:04.280> make<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.549> vending<00:02:05.270> machine<00:02:05.299> best<00:02:05.959> thing<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
to make a vending machine best thing to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.730 
to make a vending machine best thing to
do<00:02:06.469> is<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.909> google<00:02:07.909> well<00:02:08.569> youtube<00:02:09.140> search<00:02:09.380> how

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
do is to google well youtube search how

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.590 
do is to google well youtube search how
to<00:02:09.770> make<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.100> very<00:02:10.459> machine<00:02:10.819> don't<00:02:11.120> copy<00:02:11.330> this

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
to make a very machine don't copy this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.860 
to make a very machine don't copy this
because<00:02:11.870> it's<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.200> terrible<00:02:12.770> model<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:14.600> yeah

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
because it's a terrible model but yeah

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.590 
because it's a terrible model but yeah
this<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.380> all<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> Redstone<00:02:16.100> behind<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.730> I'm

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
this is all the Redstone behind it I'm

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.440 
this is all the Redstone behind it I'm
no<00:02:17.870> expert<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.590> redstone<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.300> may<00:02:20.420> be

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
no expert in redstone and you may be

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.100 
no expert in redstone and you may be
asking

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
asking

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.320 
asking
i'm<00:02:21.170> making<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.620> video<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.670> case<00:02:22.910> but

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
i'm making this video in that case but

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.020 
i'm making this video in that case but
you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.900> know<00:02:24.170> about<00:02:24.920> logic<00:02:25.370> gets<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.000> i

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
you know i know about logic gets so i

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.680 
you know i know about logic gets so i
thought<00:02:26.420> why<00:02:26.630> not<00:02:26.800> because<00:02:27.800> lots<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.160> people

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
thought why not because lots of people

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.350 
thought why not because lots of people
can<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:30.580> only<00:02:32.530> put<00:02:33.530> together<00:02:33.920> an<00:02:34.700> iron<00:02:35.150> door

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
can just only put together an iron door

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.000 
can just only put together an iron door
under<00:02:35.780> switch<00:02:36.050> using<00:02:36.410> redstone<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:39.010> yeah

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
under switch using redstone and yeah

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.890 
under switch using redstone and yeah
with<00:02:40.520> logic<00:02:41.030> gates<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.570> be<00:02:41.690> more

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
with logic gates you can be more

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.110 
with logic gates you can be more
creative<00:02:44.200> yeah<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.520> give<00:02:47.000> the
