00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:35.520
 what we did as an educational project 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 after shares was to resume a little 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 the titles of the topics they 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.160
 had first year propaedeutic 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.489
 in all schools of higher art 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.489
 public 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.690
 it's giving them a little soft like that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.000
 of general knowledge what will their 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 allow to pass the competitions we have 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.710
 a lot of drawing lessons or that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.629
 reflect 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.980
 my writing and so on from a province 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.930
 really really fast I think 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.100
 I would not have had any contest or any case 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.430
 certainly not the fine arts sense 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.000
 she was not prepared and I think 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.100
 that it will miss prepare you have me 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.460
 brought a method is a rigor that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.330
 allowed me to develop a project 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.619
 differently than if I had done it at 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.630
 I'm sure I would have done 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.780
 horrors that there we go in and no I have not 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.780
 made 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.320
 we try to avoid that it's more of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 parks to guide them in their choices 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 of school a contract if you want with them 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
 to make them enter our eyes as the to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 pretty much everywhere it's a very good 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 prepa because finally the student is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.090
 a little in the center of attention and you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 see that they attach importance to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.670
 what t2 be they are not going to make a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.789
 course to a group in fact we made a 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.149
 course to one person each will have his shrink 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.149
 courteous 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:17.230
 we work from personalities 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.790
 compared to centers of interest by 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 relative to their surroundings in relation to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.750
 things that affect them 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.030
 personally and with the ach they have 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.040
 and questions that may arise 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.480
 18 20 years which is good also after 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.200
 by sector we can enter a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.609
 dynamic 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.430
 it's motivating enough to see all 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.750
 people around you who want who 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.790
 do things all the time you have a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.299
 little taken in a trick that allows you 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.950
 to advance 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.599
 finally because you're going to do this 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 will really be you who made them and 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.079
 will not be influenced by an exercise 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.079
 that she competes car 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.280
 the whole team is working on a notion 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.569
 phase there are three phases of 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.569
 meshes of the subjects this is the way 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.540
 subject that curan gives with others 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.900
 teachers are really the subjects of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.209
 based 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.990
 they have everything all over little 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.580
 whatever they want to do at 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.200
 departure they have everything to be able 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.140
 open up and then discover also 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 things it lasts a month and a half for 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.990
 phase 2 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.580
 they are spread more by field and 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.170
 is this phase 2 important because 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.459
 that it's all the setting up of the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.459
 artistic dossier of the student 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.890
 there is a lot of attention of scope there 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:36.360
 never know students actually when they 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.560
 arrive after no I like the fact 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 that we are in a report that is not 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 a report too much of obedience eventually 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.110
 we do not have a huge power over them 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.700
 is really the referent in 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.110
 interlocutor but we are here for all 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.379
 moments that are not going mans who 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.030
 go there are white juries there are some 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.239
 conducted prepares a lot to talk to 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.620
 know how to say a few words a month with 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.579
 simplicity also we look at the whole 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.720
 of their work 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.129
 we must still really 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.739
 advisors on choosing schools that 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.129
 are going to present it's a year a bit 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.129
 revealing fact 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.630
 today we can not do a 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.620
 art school without going through 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.780
 a preparatory school 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.970
 a student who works he necessarily 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.250
 a contest I had in orleans and limoges 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.870
 so pictures I liked it a lot and good 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.730
 recently I saw that I was on the list 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.170
 of Attempted for Saint-Etienne and if that the 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.870
 do well as it's my first choice 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.610
 would be perfect so I was admitted 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.200
 to the fine arts I do not see me at all 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.740
 refused this school I find that a 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.450
 very good level 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.450
 Finally, I find the test of ecology
