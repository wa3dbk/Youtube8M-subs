the<00:01:57.210> top<00:01:57.479> sites<00:01:58.100> they<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> little

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the top sites they have the little

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.850 
the top sites they have the little
residue<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
residue and see if this one is this is

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
residue and see if this one is this is
one<00:02:02.040> life<00:02:02.280> thing<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.610> did<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.090> did<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.750> left

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
one life thing I did I did the left

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.149 
one life thing I did I did the left
behind<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> added<00:02:04.799> chooser<00:02:05.070> grinds<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
behind I added chooser grinds on this

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.850 
behind I added chooser grinds on this
I<00:02:06.249> do<00:02:06.939> like<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.570> better<00:02:07.749> on<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.349> it's

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
I do like it better on this and it's

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.229 
I do like it better on this and it's
actually<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.340> original<00:02:09.459> guy<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.090> what

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
actually the original guy and what

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.210 
actually the original guy and what
should<00:02:10.539> be<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:10.810> Acra<00:02:11.170> dashi<00:02:11.379> so<00:02:11.800> i<00:02:11.860> can<00:02:12.099> open

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
should be on Acra dashi so i can open

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.369 
should be on Acra dashi so i can open
with<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.610> traditional<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.900> see<00:02:14.140> that

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
with the traditional and you see that

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.699 
with the traditional and you see that
all<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:15.340> nice<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.760> high<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.360> have

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
all really nice and high so you have

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.770 
all really nice and high so you have
actually<00:02:17.709> very<00:02:18.069> lean<00:02:18.370> grinds<00:02:18.819> giving<00:02:19.569> you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
actually very lean grinds giving you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.770 
actually very lean grinds giving you
super<00:02:20.560> pointy<00:02:20.830> tip<00:02:21.280> these<00:02:22.000> are<00:02:22.180> not<00:02:22.330> chart<00:02:22.599> on

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
super pointy tip these are not chart on

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.289 
super pointy tip these are not chart on
it<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.890> will<00:02:24.129> get<00:02:24.310> small<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:24.849> micro

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
it this will get small little micro

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.220 
it this will get small little micro
bevel<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:27.420> yeah<00:02:28.420> I'll<00:02:28.660> probably<00:02:28.810> put<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
bevel it's yeah I'll probably put the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.720 
bevel it's yeah I'll probably put the
microphone<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.830> it's<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.040> little<00:02:30.280> easier<00:02:30.489> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
microphone so it's a little easier to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.280 
microphone so it's a little easier to
sharpen<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.299> have<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.599> sharpen<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.110> whole

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
sharpen you have to sharpen the whole

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.809 
sharpen you have to sharpen the whole
height<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.860> bevel<00:02:33.190> because<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
height of the bevel because that is a

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.089 
height of the bevel because that is a
big<00:02:34.120> battle<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:35.230> wouldn't<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:35.650> fun<00:02:35.920> to

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
big battle and it wouldn't be fun to

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.860 
big battle and it wouldn't be fun to
sharpen<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.000> gonna<00:02:37.209> be<00:02:37.299> easier<00:02:37.720> with

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
sharpen it so it's gonna be easier with

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.809 
sharpen it so it's gonna be easier with
small<00:02:38.170> micro<00:02:38.500> bevel<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.099> it's<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.730> to

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
small micro bevel and it's not going to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.300 
small micro bevel and it's not going to
be<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.030> know<00:02:40.090> there's<00:02:40.450> they're<00:02:40.959> super<00:02:41.650> thin

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
be you know there's they're super thin

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.210 
be you know there's they're super thin
already<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.379> microwave<00:02:44.769> will<00:02:44.890> be<00:02:45.040> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
already so the microwave will be so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.890 
already so the microwave will be so
small<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.640> it's<00:02:46.329> still<00:02:46.540> going<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> be

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
small that it's still going to be

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.410 
small that it's still going to be
actually<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.799> good<00:02:47.920> cut<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.640> like<00:02:49.239> this

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
actually a really good cut I like this

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.940 
actually a really good cut I like this
these<00:02:49.660> are<00:02:49.720> pretty<00:02:50.140> cool<00:02:50.349> these<00:02:50.500> are<00:02:50.560> slightly

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
these are pretty cool these are slightly

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.100 
these are pretty cool these are slightly
larger<00:02:51.519> than<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.700> last<00:02:51.940> chord<00:02:52.299> ashes<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.959> I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
larger than the last chord ashes and I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.740 
larger than the last chord ashes and I
like<00:02:53.319> them<00:02:53.530> give<00:02:54.340> them<00:02:54.519> more<00:02:54.760> more<00:02:55.299> length<00:02:55.599> on

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
like them give them more more length on

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.800 
like them give them more more length on
the<00:02:55.870> blade<00:02:56.370> kind<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.489> broaden<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.030> up<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.690> know

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
the blade kind of broaden it up you know

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.789 
the blade kind of broaden it up you know
this<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.079> little<00:02:59.500> wider<00:02:59.829> like<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> lot<00:03:01.799> so

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
this is little wider like that a lot so

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.309 
this is little wider like that a lot so
we<00:03:03.069> get<00:03:03.310> five<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.730> those<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.180> i<00:03:04.239> did<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.569> my

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
we get five of those and i did this my

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.949 
we get five of those and i did this my
first<00:03:05.590> time<00:03:05.769> on<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.129> crater<00:03:06.579> handle<00:03:07.120> which<00:03:07.540> i

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
first time on the crater handle which i

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.190 
first time on the crater handle which i
think<00:03:08.709> came<00:03:09.220> out<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:09.730> cool<00:03:10.180> i<00:03:10.480> do<00:03:10.540> like<00:03:10.989> it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
think came out really cool i do like it

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.379 
think came out really cool i do like it
a<00:03:11.290> lot<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:12.250> wasn't<00:03:12.639> sure<00:03:12.760> how<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.150> gonna<00:03:13.269> turn

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
a lot it wasn't sure how it's gonna turn

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.750 
a lot it wasn't sure how it's gonna turn
out<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.230> end<00:03:14.410> now<00:03:14.680> as<00:03:14.950> i<00:03:15.190> was<00:03:15.340> learning<00:03:15.549> it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
out on the end now as i was learning it

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.690 
out on the end now as i was learning it
I<00:03:15.970> had<00:03:16.299> this<00:03:16.420> idea<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:16.810> wanted<00:03:17.139> to<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.349> it<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:17.709> I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
I had this idea I wanted to do it but I

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.629 
I had this idea I wanted to do it but I
gotta<00:03:19.000> say<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.299> do<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.349> lot<00:03:20.590> just<00:03:21.459> nicely

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
gotta say I do like it a lot just nicely

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.120 
gotta say I do like it a lot just nicely
Shefford<00:03:22.419> all<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.690> chorus<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.859> shows

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
Shefford all the chorus and it shows

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.900 
Shefford all the chorus and it shows
nicely<00:03:24.639> on<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.910> tiger<00:03:25.359> stripe<00:03:25.630> g10<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
nicely on that tiger stripe g10 and the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.080 
nicely on that tiger stripe g10 and the
craters<00:03:28.389> done<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.959> those<00:03:29.139> carbide<00:03:29.859> bits<00:03:30.190> bit

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
craters done with those carbide bits bit

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.879 
craters done with those carbide bits bit
so<00:03:31.269> they're<00:03:31.419> kind<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.840> perfect<00:03:32.470> inside

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
so they're kind of like perfect inside

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.789 
so they're kind of like perfect inside
and<00:03:32.950> see<00:03:33.609> if<00:03:33.669> you<00:03:33.760> can<00:03:33.910> focus<00:03:34.150> ii<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:35.620> don't

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
and see if you can focus ii so you don't

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.979 
and see if you can focus ii so you don't
really<00:03:35.980> see<00:03:36.459> no<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.880> Mars<00:03:37.239> on<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.599> inside

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
really see no to Mars on the inside

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.830 
really see no to Mars on the inside
they're<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:38.440> perfect<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:40.510> know<00:03:40.630> well<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
they're like perfect and you know well I

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.479

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
you second like a scant scandi you know

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.320 
you second like a scant scandi you know
it's<00:05:16.070> going<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.310> get<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.580> small<00:05:16.880> secondary

it's going to get the small secondary

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.110 
it's going to get the small secondary
bevel<00:05:17.570> but<00:05:18.160> it's<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.370> regular<00:05:19.640> flight

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120
