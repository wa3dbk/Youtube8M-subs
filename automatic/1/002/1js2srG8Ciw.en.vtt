this<00:00:30.910> is<00:00:31.210> one<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.439> flavors<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.399> they

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
this is one of the flavors that they

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.080 
this is one of the flavors that they
discontinued<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.140> they<00:00:35.260> stopped<00:00:35.500> making<00:00:35.890> it

very very enjoyable a nice smooth smoke
and<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.989> me<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.560> my<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.829> natural

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and to me one of my more natural

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.059 
and to me one of my more natural
favorite<00:02:45.720> natural<00:02:46.319> flavors<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.920> I've

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
favorite natural flavors that I've

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.819 
favorite natural flavors that I've
smoked<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:48.900> I'm<00:02:49.019> kind<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> upset<00:02:49.440> that

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
smoked I you know I'm kind of upset that

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.199 
smoked I you know I'm kind of upset that
they've<00:02:49.950> discontinued<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.760> flavor<00:02:51.030> because

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
they've discontinued this flavor because

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.509 
they've discontinued this flavor because
I<00:02:51.390> think<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.840> one<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.890> those<00:02:52.980> flavors<00:02:53.489> that

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
I think it's one of those flavors that

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.699 
I think it's one of those flavors that
Tangiers<00:02:54.150> does<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.200> bit<00:02:55.440> out<00:02:55.650> of

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
Tangiers does that's a little bit out of

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.580 
Tangiers does that's a little bit out of
the<00:02:55.920> norm<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.940> really<00:02:57.329> enjoy<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.500> I'll
