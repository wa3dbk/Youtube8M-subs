00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
if I go to all right so it was August

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940 
if I go to all right so it was August
8th<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> I'll<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.750> click<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.080> August<00:01:16.439> 8th<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
can't just use Garmin training center to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.580 
can't just use Garmin training center to
turn<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.640> course<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.259> could

center is going to turn all of that into

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
center is going to turn all of that into
a<00:01:36.479> virtual<00:01:37.020> partner<00:01:37.439> course<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.189> going

pretty<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> same<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.800> only<00:02:10.830> difference

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
pretty much the same the only difference

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.860 
pretty much the same the only difference
is<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> Garmin<00:02:12.510> training<00:02:13.110> center<00:02:13.530> for

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
is that the Garmin training center for

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.320 
is that the Garmin training center for
Matt<00:02:14.099> also<00:02:15.099> contains<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.670> your<00:02:15.819> heart<00:02:16.090> rate

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
Matt also contains like your heart rate

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.509 
Matt also contains like your heart rate
and<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.690> power<00:02:16.900> meter<00:02:17.230> stuff<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.400> your

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
and your power meter stuff and your

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.380 
and your power meter stuff and your
cadence<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:20.019> GPX<00:02:20.860> format<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.670> has<00:02:22.000> your

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
cadence the GPX format just has your

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.809 
cadence the GPX format just has your
position<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.319> speed<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.099> what<00:02:24.340> time<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.790> was

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
position and speed and what time it was

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.089 
position and speed and what time it was
so<00:02:25.599> either<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.260> these<00:02:26.379> will<00:02:26.620> do<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:26.950> I'm<00:02:27.069> just

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
so either of these will do so I'm just

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.930 
so either of these will do so I'm just
going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> save<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.849> as<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.760> turns

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
going to save it as this and it turns

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.119 
going to save it as this and it turns
out<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.269> I've<00:02:31.390> already<00:02:32.319> run<00:02:32.739> through<00:02:32.980> this

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
out that I've already run through this

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.809 
out that I've already run through this

here's<00:04:59.669> 2011<00:05:00.669> May<00:05:01.000> 12<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.860> can<00:05:03.039> scroll

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
here's 2011 May 12 and so I can scroll

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.240 
here's 2011 May 12 and so I can scroll
down<00:05:03.580> here<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:05.080> can<00:05:05.110> get<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:06.150> 2011<00:05:07.150> 8<00:05:07.770> 8<00:05:08.770> so

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
down here and I can get to 2011 8 8 so

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.339 
down here and I can get to 2011 8 8 so
that<00:05:09.490> would<00:05:09.729> be<00:05:10.029> the<00:05:10.870> ride<00:05:11.139> that<00:05:11.169> I'm<00:05:11.469> after<00:05:13.349> so

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
that would be the ride that I'm after so

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.309 
that would be the ride that I'm after so
now<00:05:14.889> that's<00:05:15.099> not<00:05:15.400> in<00:05:15.669> TC<00:05:16.120> X<00:05:16.240> or<00:05:16.419> GPX<00:05:16.900> format

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
now that's not in TC X or GPX format

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.640 
now that's not in TC X or GPX format
that's<00:05:17.560> actually<00:05:17.949> in<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:18.219> fit<00:05:18.550> file<00:05:18.879> which<00:05:19.210> I'll

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
that's actually in a fit file which I'll

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.850 
that's actually in a fit file which I'll
probably<00:05:20.650> mention<00:05:21.099> later<00:05:21.699> but<00:05:22.629> it's<00:05:23.500> actually

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
probably mention later but it's actually

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.950 
probably mention later but it's actually
the<00:05:24.219> least<00:05:24.430> amount<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:24.819> bloodshed<00:05:25.060> is<00:05:25.569> if<00:05:25.810> you

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
the least amount of bloodshed is if you

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.790 
the least amount of bloodshed is if you
use<00:05:26.969> Garmin<00:05:27.969> training<00:05:28.449> center<00:05:28.779> or<00:05:28.930> if<00:05:29.349> you<00:05:29.500> use

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
use Garmin training center or if you use

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.879 
use Garmin training center or if you use
