you don't want to get it past 100 or
below<00:00:59.129> 100<00:00:59.550> because<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> low<00:01:00.239> 100's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
below 100 because if it's the low 100's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
below 100 because if it's the low 100's
just<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.140> slow<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.489> pastime<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.539> get

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:00.199 
that that works the best but I think the
bathtubs<00:02:50.770> probably<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> best<00:02:51.550> one<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:54.990> okay

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.910 

materials<00:03:01.209> okay<00:03:01.420> most<00:03:01.870> servers<00:03:02.110> are<00:03:02.590> gonna

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
materials okay most servers are gonna

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.000 
materials okay most servers are gonna
have<00:03:03.190> invisible<00:03:04.020> yeah<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:08.350> before<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.950> start

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
have invisible yeah so before you start

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.100 
have invisible yeah so before you start
prop<00:03:09.340> killing<00:03:09.760> if<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.180> want<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.420> not<00:03:10.750> go

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
prop killing if you just want to not go

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.190 
prop killing if you just want to not go
full-out<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.120> should<00:03:13.300> make<00:03:13.780> a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
full-out like like you should make a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.320 
full-out like like you should make a
server<00:03:14.470> go<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.680> shit<00:03:15.010> nice<00:03:15.700> want<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.970> practice

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
server go to shit nice want to practice

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.800 
server go to shit nice want to practice
on<00:03:16.480> people<00:03:16.860> I'd<00:03:17.860> say<00:03:18.100> just<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:19.209> your<00:03:19.360> physics

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
on people I'd say just have your physics

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.640 
on people I'd say just have your physics
gonna<00:03:21.239> go<00:03:22.239> gonna<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.750> they<00:03:22.870> just<00:03:23.019> want<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.470> I

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
gonna go gonna and they just want it I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.640 
gonna go gonna and they just want it I
can<00:03:23.680> visit<00:03:24.010> pregnant<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.930> we'll<00:03:26.140> see<00:03:26.290> servers

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
can visit pregnant and we'll see servers

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.960 
can visit pregnant and we'll see servers
have<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.040> kinda<00:03:27.250> looks<00:03:27.489> like<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:29.970> looks

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
have it it kinda looks like it looks

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.509 
have it it kinda looks like it looks
like<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.390> looks<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.800> just<00:03:33.370> go

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
like it looks like that just just go

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.830 
like it looks like that just just go
around<00:03:35.190> trying<00:03:36.190> different<00:03:36.489> things<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.510> then

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
around trying different things and then

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.910 
around trying different things and then
you<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:40.030> if<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.330> ever<00:03:40.680> going<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.739> have

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
you but if this ever going to have

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.330 
you but if this ever going to have
invisible<00:03:42.519> one<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:43.180> then<00:03:43.330> from<00:03:43.540> that's<00:03:43.780> just

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
invisible one and then from that's just

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.580 
invisible one and then from that's just
just<00:03:45.340> easy<00:03:45.610> killing<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:49.440> let's<00:03:50.440> how<00:03:50.530> to

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
just easy killing so let's how to

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.370 
just easy killing so let's how to
