00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.220
 hello and welcome again i am cs from 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.830
 they bring a trick here on the map 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.690
 rate and good this trick is after 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.760
 patch since the trick of dell streak 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.180
 jump they patched it they put a barrier 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.190
 okay and well just this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 trick is still easier to perform not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.600
 you have to make two stars but there are 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.700
 than to do one only and it's going to be in the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.400
 opposite side so instead of going through 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.650
 the side that we're going to go this way 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.810
 it's pretty hard to make them star am 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.260
 I told you earlier, I also uploaded a 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.179
 trick with star cost me quite 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.530
 and good what you have to do is go up 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.760
 here by the stairs or by the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.500
 another side that can also be 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.509
 and once uploaded what you have to do 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 it is quite important to have a gun 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.380
 light or a light submachine gun 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.380
 agreement and what you have to do is very 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.270
 simple turn the camera and jump at once 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.040
 in agreement that is when you rotate you jump and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.500
 you run at the same time is a little complicated 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.400
 principle but if you get practice at 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.520
 final we will end well 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.880
 you will not do more or less easy depends as 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 I see you 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 and well nothing here the trick here 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.880
 you can do everything in truth in the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.430
 ceiling you can shoot from here and kill 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.430
 later you will see it and even you 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.770
 you can put under the map and kill from 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.420
 under the map is pretty good from 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.039
 under the map I think it can kill us 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.990
 at least it has not killed me yet 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.380
 well I have not even been shot 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.770
 because what's done with bots 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.439
 and nothing to leave the map now you will see 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.000
 it's around here you just have to walk 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.130
 go ahead here or jump 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.450
 simply and you will stay here of 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.520
 agreement from here you can also kill 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.469
 to the front if you want but here eyes 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.759
 I would have you killed and good 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.399
 just here you have to throw 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.440
 p'alante and to put down the map there is as 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.910
 you see and once here below the map and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.709
 you will be invincible 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.540
 unless they shoot you they do not have 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.870
 grenades or something I do not know if it will kill you that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.459
 but maybe yes or maybe we and well here 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.650
 Under the map, you can kill everything 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.420
 I know good before I finish 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.910
