choreography you go to separate sides of
the<00:01:20.340> room<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:20.850> start<00:01:21.150> calling<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.479> out

music<00:01:25.049> starts<00:01:25.320> playing<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.369> personally

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
music starts playing and I personally

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.800

was really nervous

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
was really nervous
I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> mock<00:01:28.770> audition<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.520> an<00:01:29.640> awesome

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I think the mock audition is an awesome

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
I think the mock audition is an awesome
thing<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> helps<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thing because it helps me when I want to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.310 
thing because it helps me when I want to
audition<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> Rockette<00:01:33.570> knowing<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
combinations especially with the style

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.810 
combinations especially with the style
