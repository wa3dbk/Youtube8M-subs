iron set is really to iron sets in one
this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.930> basically<00:00:19.590> because<00:00:19.949> Nike

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
this is basically because Nike

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.580 
this is basically because Nike
understands<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.119> better<00:00:21.689> players<00:00:22.080> may<00:00:22.350> want

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.240 
the pocket cavity now personally I play
five<00:01:51.750> through<00:01:52.049> pitching<00:01:52.380> wedge<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
five through pitching wedge because I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.969 
five through pitching wedge because I
hit<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.790> low<00:01:54.030> ball<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.530> three<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
hit a very low ball and so a three and a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.170 
hit a very low ball and so a three and a
four<00:01:56.130> iron<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.640> sense<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.060> me<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
four iron don't make sense for me I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
four iron don't make sense for me I
don't<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.750> distance<00:01:58.140> gaps<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.280> with

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
don't get good distance gaps but with

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
don't get good distance gaps but with
these<00:02:00.000> irons<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.930> ball<00:02:01.110> launches<00:02:01.649> two

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
these irons the ball launches two

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.639 
these irons the ball launches two
degrees<00:02:02.310> higher<00:02:02.579> compared<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.390> clubs<00:02:03.689> with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
degrees higher compared to my clubs with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
degrees higher compared to my clubs with
the<00:02:04.680> long<00:02:04.950> irons<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.060> could<00:02:06.479> actually<00:02:06.659> play

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the long irons so I could actually play

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330 
the long irons so I could actually play
three<00:02:07.350> through<00:02:07.560> pitching<00:02:07.860> wedge<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.009> have

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
three through pitching wedge and have

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.969 
three through pitching wedge and have
real<00:02:08.849> distance<00:02:09.330> gaps<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> way<00:02:10.170> through

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
real distance gaps all the way through

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
real distance gaps all the way through
because<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> those<00:02:11.730> long<00:02:12.030> irons<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.480> getting

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because the those long irons are getting

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.530 
because the those long irons are getting
up<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> much<00:02:13.319> more<00:02:13.500> playable<00:02:13.769> trajectory<00:02:14.540> in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
up on a much more playable trajectory in

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.059 
up on a much more playable trajectory in
addition<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.140> they<00:02:16.440> are<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.860> more

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
addition to that they are a little more

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.190 
addition to that they are a little more
forgiving<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.510> hit<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.780> little<00:02:18.959> bit

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
forgiving you can hit it a little bit

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.860 
forgiving you can hit it a little bit
thin<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:20.250> toe<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.549> little<00:02:20.670> heel<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.360> still

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
thin little toe a little heel and still

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.100 
thin little toe a little heel and still
get<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> pretty<00:02:22.230> good<00:02:22.409> result<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
get a pretty good result and with that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.570 
get a pretty good result and with that
you're<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.319> really<00:02:25.590> giving<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.010> any<00:02:26.159> control

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
you're not really giving up any control

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.039 
you're not really giving up any control
of<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> ball<00:02:26.879> if<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.720> hit<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
of the ball if you do want to hit a

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.020 
of the ball if you do want to hit a
little<00:02:28.170> cut<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.680> little<00:02:28.890> draw<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.790> still

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
little cut a little draw you can still

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.330 
little cut a little draw you can still
do<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.239> even<00:02:30.299> with<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.720> long<00:02:30.900> irons<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.280> to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
do that even with the long irons so to
