00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
December of 84 and I had a prototype

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.369 
December of 84 and I had a prototype
just<00:00:33.680> mean<00:00:34.690> pre-production<00:00:35.690> prototype<00:00:36.170> but

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
just mean pre-production prototype but

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.560 
just mean pre-production prototype but
it<00:00:36.469> was<00:00:36.620> just<00:00:37.219> like<00:00:37.340> this<00:00:37.699> actually<00:00:38.480> was

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
it was just like this actually was

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.229 
it was just like this actually was
really<00:00:38.690> pre-production<00:00:39.469> because<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:40.239> don't

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
really pre-production because I don't
