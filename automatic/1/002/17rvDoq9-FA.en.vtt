suck<00:00:47.080> with<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.410> I<00:00:47.559> don't<00:00:47.769> know<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.580> is<00:00:48.699> a

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
suck with it I don't know this is a

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.750 
suck with it I don't know this is a
pretty<00:00:49.030> good<00:00:49.239> game<00:00:49.449> but<00:00:49.809> I<00:00:50.110> actually<00:00:50.949> got<00:00:51.460> like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
pretty good game but I actually got like

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.869 
pretty good game but I actually got like
a<00:00:51.790> 40<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:53.290> was<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:53.559> 40<00:00:53.979> and<00:00:54.129> 10<00:00:54.400> i<00:00:54.430> think<00:00:54.760> it

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
a 40 it was like 40 and 10 i think it

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.660 
a 40 it was like 40 and 10 i think it
was<00:00:54.970> super<00:00:55.600> action<00:00:55.809> packed<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:57.280> sucks

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
was super action packed and it sucks

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.340 
was super action packed and it sucks
because<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.150> was<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.330> first<00:00:58.360> time<00:00:58.809> theater

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
because it was the first time theater

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.030 
because it was the first time theater
has<00:00:59.650> ever<00:00:59.860> cut<00:01:00.220> off<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.400> video<00:01:00.820> for<00:01:01.180> me<00:01:01.299> it<00:01:01.839> only

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
has ever cut off a video for me it only

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.030 
has ever cut off a video for me it only
got<00:01:03.040> like<00:01:03.220> my<00:01:03.370> first<00:01:03.549> 16<00:01:04.030> kills<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:05.040> hopefully

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
got like my first 16 kills so hopefully

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.350 
got like my first 16 kills so hopefully
that's<00:01:06.250> not<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.460> recurring<00:01:06.880> theme<00:01:07.090> because

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
that's not a recurring theme because

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.149 
that's not a recurring theme because
that<00:01:07.540> would<00:01:07.690> be<00:01:07.810> super<00:01:08.110> gay<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:08.830> happened<00:01:09.130> to

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
that would be super gay that happened to

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.359 
that would be super gay that happened to
me<00:01:09.250> in<00:01:09.340> black<00:01:09.549> ops<00:01:09.790> all<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.540> time<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:12.280> was

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
me in black ops all the time and I was

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.680 
me in black ops all the time and I was
hoping<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:12.760> theater<00:01:13.060> mode<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.330> be<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.450> little

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
hoping this theater mode to be a little

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.130 
hoping this theater mode to be a little
bit<00:01:13.840> more<00:01:13.960> reliable<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:15.369> hopefully<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.360> will

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
bit more reliable so hopefully that will

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.840 
bit more reliable so hopefully that will
be<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.380> case<00:01:17.409> in<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.770> future<00:01:18.040> but<00:01:18.190> don't

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
be the case in the future but don't

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.700 
be the case in the future but don't
worry<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.060> got<00:01:19.270> some<00:01:19.510> I<00:01:19.780> had<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.080> bunch<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.590> good

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
worry I got some I had a bunch of good

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
top-notch gameplay in the very near

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.459 
top-notch gameplay in the very near
future<00:01:25.689> but<00:01:26.170> this<00:01:27.039> game<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:28.119> f<00:01:28.240> ad<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.869> mean

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
future but this game the f ad I mean

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.620 
future but this game the f ad I mean
it's<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.890> last<00:01:30.070> assault<00:01:30.369> rifle<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.759> unlock<00:01:31.090> it

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
it's a last assault rifle you unlock it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.669 
it's a last assault rifle you unlock it
is<00:01:32.229> good<00:01:32.770> but<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.670> don't<00:01:34.600> think<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.140> nearly<00:01:35.469> as

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
is good but I don't think it's nearly as

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.789 
is good but I don't think it's nearly as
good<00:01:35.829> as<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:35.979> ACR<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.789> personally<00:01:37.600> think<00:01:37.810> after

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
good as the ACR I personally think after

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.230 
good as the ACR I personally think after
playing<00:01:39.039> this<00:01:39.250> game<00:01:39.460> for<00:01:39.520> quite<00:01:39.969> a<00:01:40.000> while<00:01:40.179> now

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
playing this game for quite a while now

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.260 
playing this game for quite a while now
I<00:01:40.719> think<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> ACR<00:01:41.759> definitely<00:01:42.759> needs<00:01:42.969> to<00:01:43.149> get

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
I think the ACR definitely needs to get

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.039 
I think the ACR definitely needs to get
patched<00:01:43.509> it's<00:01:43.990> just<00:01:44.350> too<00:01:44.590> strong<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.340> has

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
patched it's just too strong and has

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.660 
patched it's just too strong and has
absolutely<00:01:47.049> no<00:01:47.289> recoil<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:48.189> seems<00:01:48.429> like<00:01:48.549> I'm

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
absolutely no recoil it seems like I'm

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.239 
absolutely no recoil it seems like I'm
like<00:01:48.909> it's<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.299> god<00:01:49.450> I'm<00:01:49.570> getting<00:01:49.689> killed<00:01:49.990> by

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
like it's the god I'm getting killed by

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.959 
like it's the god I'm getting killed by
eighty<00:01:51.249> percent<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> time<00:01:52.539> when<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.840> die

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
eighty percent of the time when I die

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.200 
eighty percent of the time when I die
but<00:01:54.969> anyways<00:01:55.469> um<00:01:56.469> so<00:01:57.399> this<00:01:57.520> gun<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.909> mean<00:01:58.060> it's

extra bullet it takes you to kill with a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.130 
extra bullet it takes you to kill with a
silencer<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.460> gonna<00:02:12.670> be<00:02:12.790> worth<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.750> of

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
silencer is gonna be worth it because of

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.860 
silencer is gonna be worth it because of
like<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.530> such<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> fast<00:02:15.100> fire<00:02:15.640> rate<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.690> that

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
like a such a fast fire rate and so that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.710 
like a such a fast fire rate and so that
he's<00:02:16.990> not<00:02:17.140> gonna<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.350> where<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.830> are<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.220> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
he's not gonna know where you are and I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.330 
he's not gonna know where you are and I
I<00:02:19.720> personally<00:02:20.380> recommend<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.770> silencer<00:02:21.160> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
I personally recommend the silencer and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.400 
I personally recommend the silencer and
right<00:02:21.970> here<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.210> was<00:02:22.390> hoping<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:22.990> guy<00:02:23.110> would

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
right here I was hoping this guy would

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.650 
right here I was hoping this guy would
walk<00:02:23.620> by<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> wanted<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.490> shoot<00:02:25.000> his<00:02:25.180> betty<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
walk by I wanted to shoot his betty and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.350 
walk by I wanted to shoot his betty and
kill<00:02:25.870> him<00:02:26.020> with<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:27.299> unfortunately<00:02:28.299> I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360

description if i remember but I he is he
got<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.380> strategy<00:02:42.190> where<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.540> basically<00:02:43.840> in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
got this strategy where so basically in

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.530 
got this strategy where so basically in
the<00:02:44.170> support<00:02:44.500> killstreak<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.580> lowest<00:02:46.060> third

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
the support killstreak the lowest third

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.480 
the support killstreak the lowest third
streak<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.110> can<00:02:47.260> choose<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:48.100> was<00:02:48.310> nasty

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
streak you can choose that was nasty

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.120 
streak you can choose that was nasty
right<00:02:48.850> there<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.680> lowest<00:02:50.860> third

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
right there but the lowest third

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.070 
right there but the lowest third
killstreak<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> use<00:02:52.210> is<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> Sam<00:02:52.840> turret

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
killstreak you can use is the Sam turret

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770 
killstreak you can use is the Sam turret
at<00:02:53.290> eight<00:02:53.500> kills<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.100> they<00:02:54.670> did<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.270> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
at eight kills and they did that for a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.590 
at eight kills and they did that for a
reason<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.440> reason<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.700> what<00:02:58.480> you're

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
reason and that reason is what you're

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.190 
reason and that reason is what you're
seeing<00:02:58.780> right<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.020> if<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.790> only<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.300> a4

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
seeing right here if you only have a4

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.560 
seeing right here if you only have a4
and<00:03:02.410> a5<00:03:02.500> kill<00:03:02.980> streak<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.490> you<00:03:04.060> can<00:03:04.210> just<00:03:04.360> keep

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
and a5 kill streak on you can just keep

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.990 
and a5 kill streak on you can just keep
getting<00:03:05.020> them<00:03:05.350> over<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.070> over<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.520> over<00:03:06.610> it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
getting them over and over and over it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.430 
getting them over and over and over it
was<00:03:07.270> like<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.600> had<00:03:07.720> eight<00:03:08.020> kills<00:03:08.260> your

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
was like if you had eight kills your

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.750 
was like if you had eight kills your
guide<00:03:08.590> you'd<00:03:08.740> have<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.950> work<00:03:09.100> all<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.580> way<00:03:09.610> up

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
guide you'd have to work all the way up

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.190 
guide you'd have to work all the way up
to<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.880> eighth<00:03:10.060> kill<00:03:10.330> streak<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.810> then<00:03:10.900> start

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
to the eighth kill streak and then start

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.280 
to the eighth kill streak and then start
all<00:03:11.350> over<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.670> Xcal<00:03:13.270> had<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> brilliant<00:03:13.900> idea

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
all over but Xcal had the brilliant idea

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.350 
all over but Xcal had the brilliant idea
of<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:15.310> putting<00:03:16.350> UAV<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:18.090> ballistic<00:03:19.090> vests

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
of just putting UAV and ballistic vests

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.630 
of just putting UAV and ballistic vests
on<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.720> basically<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.530> stacking<00:03:20.890> them<00:03:21.190> over

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
on and basically just stacking them over

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.790 
on and basically just stacking them over
and<00:03:21.760> over<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.060> over<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.470> that's<00:03:23.470> what<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.740> do

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and over and over and that's what I do

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.230 
and over and over and that's what I do
in<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.100> game<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.610> that's<00:03:24.910> what<00:03:25.060> I've<00:03:25.210> been

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
next episode honestly I think this is

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.210 
next episode honestly I think this is
the<00:04:03.850> best<00:04:04.000> MOA<00:04:04.420> be<00:04:04.660> set<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:05.350> haven't<00:04:06.070> gotten

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
the best MOA be set up I haven't gotten

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.220 
the best MOA be set up I haven't gotten
an<00:04:06.640> MIB<00:04:06.910> with<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.510> just<00:04:07.810> because<00:04:08.020> I<00:04:08.080> haven't

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230

really tried but honestly I think this

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.100 
really tried but honestly I think this
is<00:04:11.620> better<00:04:11.800> than<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.400> whole<00:04:13.239> specialist<00:04:13.900> kill

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
is better than the whole specialist kill

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.500 
is better than the whole specialist kill
