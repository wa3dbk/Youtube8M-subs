I have two textures in my hair it makes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
I have two textures in my hair it makes
it<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.190> hard<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> find<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.539> gel<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it really hard for me to find a gel that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.380 
it really hard for me to find a gel that
will<00:00:58.859> define<00:00:59.219> both<00:00:59.820> textures<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.050> pretty<00:01:01.590> much

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
will define both textures so pretty much

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.090 
will define both textures so pretty much
everything<00:01:03.559> from<00:01:04.700> about<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.299> down<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:07.290> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
everything from about here down is one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.260 
everything from about here down is one
texture<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.570> no<00:01:09.810> issues<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.740> all

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
texture and I have no issues at all

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.990 
texture and I have no issues at all
defining<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.750> hair<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.340> then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
defining this hair so from here and then

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.999 
defining this hair so from here and then
like<00:01:15.299> pretty<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.970> then

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
like pretty much like all this and then

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.320 
like pretty much like all this and then
everything<00:01:20.009> down<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.610> another<00:01:20.909> texture

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
everything down here is another texture

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.420 
everything down here is another texture
so<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> throughout<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.250> whole

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so it's like that throughout my whole

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.899 
so it's like that throughout my whole
head<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> same<00:01:25.830> thing<00:01:26.130> over<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
head and the same thing over here like

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.390 
head and the same thing over here like
all<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.110> texture<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> then

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
all of this is one texture and then

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.749 
all of this is one texture and then
pretty<00:01:30.210> much<00:01:30.299> everything<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.400> whole

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
pretty much everything like this whole

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.319 
pretty much everything like this whole
area<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.320> another<00:01:34.979> texture<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.030> what

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
area up here is another texture so what

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.350 
area up here is another texture so what
happen<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.439> say<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> use<00:01:38.310> eco<00:01:39.090> styler

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
happen is like say when I use eco styler

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
happen is like say when I use eco styler
gel<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.770> great<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> find

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
gel I will get really great to find

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.780 
gel I will get really great to find
curls<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> middle<00:01:43.770> part<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.220> then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
curls like all this middle part and then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.030 
curls like all this middle part and then
all<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> rest<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.750> my<00:01:45.899> hair<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.380> either

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
all the rest of my hair is either

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.639 
all the rest of my hair is either
weighed<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.270> gel<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.380> frizzy

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
weighed down by the gel or it's frizzy

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.510 
weighed down by the gel or it's frizzy
so<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.180> found<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.590> four<00:01:52.979> stylers

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so what I have found is the four stylers

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
so what I have found is the four stylers
that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.060> showed<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.240> guys<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.409> them

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that I just showed you guys all of them

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.280 
that I just showed you guys all of them
are<00:01:55.770> pH<00:01:56.189> balanced<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.689> main<00:01:57.960> thing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
are pH balanced that is the main thing

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
are pH balanced that is the main thing
that<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.950> focus<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.700> with<00:02:00.299> my<00:02:00.689> hair<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.640> not<00:02:02.640> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that I focus on with my hair is not so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.569 
that I focus on with my hair is not so
much<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.990> which<00:02:04.500> Theiler<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
much which which Theiler is going to

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.999 
much which which Theiler is going to
make<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.939> curls<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.540> pop<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.680> more

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
make like the curls just pop I'm more

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.369 
make like the curls just pop I'm more
focused<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:09.390> does<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> leave<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.140> hair

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
focused on one does it leave my hair

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.010 
focused on one does it leave my hair
soft<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.069> then

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
soft and then

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.690 
soft and then
does<00:02:12.980> flake<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> pH<00:02:14.510> balance<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:15.700> from

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the one things that I can always know

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.290 
the one things that I can always know
are<00:02:42.200> going<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.410> remain<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.040> same<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:44.000> pH

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
are going to remain the same is the pH

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.910 
are going to remain the same is the pH
balance<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.080> products<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.560> I'm<00:02:45.710> using

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
balance of the products that I'm using

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.180 
balance of the products that I'm using
so<00:02:46.220> well<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.000> means<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.530> all<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.920> curls

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
so well that means that all of the curls

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.640 
so well that means that all of the curls
that<00:02:49.490> are<00:02:49.610> here<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.000> top<00:02:50.210> they<00:02:50.990> are<00:02:51.290> a

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
that are here on the top they are a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.570 
that are here on the top they are a
looser<00:02:52.040> texture<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:53.570> are<00:02:53.630> prone<00:02:54.110> to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
looser texture and they are prone to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.180 
looser texture and they are prone to
frizziness<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:56.750> also<00:02:56.990> get<00:02:57.440> way<00:02:57.650> down<00:02:57.920> really

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
frizziness they also get way down really

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.820 
frizziness they also get way down really
easily<00:02:58.520> when<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.420> put<00:02:59.870> gel<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.140> my<00:03:00.320> hair<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
easily when I put gel in my hair and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.260 
easily when I put gel in my hair and
then<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:00.950> should<00:03:01.070> just<00:03:01.280> get<00:03:01.430> kind<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.820> matted

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
then you should just get kind of matted

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.570 
then you should just get kind of matted
together<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.680> then<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.070> get<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.370> this

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
together and then I just get like this

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.500 
together and then I just get like this
big<00:03:04.940> droopy<00:03:05.300> thing<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.230> front<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.770> so

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
big droopy thing in the front like so

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.230 
big droopy thing in the front like so
anyway<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.710> pretty<00:03:10.100> much<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.610> what

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
anyway so that is pretty much like what

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.290 
anyway so that is pretty much like what
I<00:03:11.270> spent<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:12.260> whole<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:13.340> first<00:03:13.670> two<00:03:14.030> years<00:03:14.240> of

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
I spent my whole like first two years of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.270 
I spent my whole like first two years of
my<00:03:14.450> natural<00:03:14.630> journey<00:03:15.080> dealing<00:03:15.830> with<00:03:15.980> was

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
my natural journey dealing with was

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.699 
my natural journey dealing with was
trying<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> figure<00:03:17.330> out<00:03:17.390> how<00:03:18.020> do<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.200> get<00:03:18.470> this

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
trying to figure out how do I get this

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.260 
trying to figure out how do I get this
defined<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.570> this<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:21.370> all<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.640> these<00:03:22.760> stylers

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
defined and this so all of these stylers

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.530 
defined and this so all of these stylers
leave<00:03:23.959> my<00:03:24.200> hair<00:03:24.470> looking<00:03:25.270> pretty<00:03:26.270> much

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
leave my hair looking pretty much

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.350 
leave my hair looking pretty much
exactly<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.830> hair<00:03:28.070> would<00:03:28.280> look<00:03:28.310> if<00:03:29.030> there

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
exactly like my hair would look if there

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
exactly like my hair would look if there
was<00:03:29.540> no<00:03:29.720> gel<00:03:30.050> in<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.350> like<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.220> really<00:03:31.580> don't

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
was no gel in it like it I really don't

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.729 
was no gel in it like it I really don't
spend<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:32.030> lot<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.209> time<00:03:32.480> manipulating<00:03:33.380> my<00:03:33.500> hair

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
spend a lot of time manipulating my hair

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.610 
spend a lot of time manipulating my hair
trying<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:34.610> make<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.360> form<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:36.200> type<00:03:36.590> of

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
trying to like make it form a type of

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.670 
trying to like make it form a type of
curl<00:03:37.070> at<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.270> point<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.780> really<00:03:39.170> don't<00:03:39.200> care

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
curl at this point I really don't care

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.190 
curl at this point I really don't care
if<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:41.180> kind<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.480> frizzy<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.080> doesn't

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
if it's kind of frizzy like it doesn't

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.890 
if it's kind of frizzy like it doesn't
bother<00:03:42.410> me<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.670> really<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.330> these<00:03:44.540> gels

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
bother me so I really like these gels

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.750 
bother me so I really like these gels
because<00:03:45.140> they<00:03:45.440> have<00:03:45.650> really<00:03:45.950> really<00:03:46.130> light

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
because they have really really light

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.259 
because they have really really light
holds<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.650> they<00:03:48.650> they<00:03:49.459> leave<00:03:49.700> your<00:03:49.850> hair<00:03:50.030> like

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
holds and they they leave your hair like

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.740 
holds and they they leave your hair like
really<00:03:50.570> curly<00:03:50.989> but<00:03:51.769> without<00:03:52.459> changing<00:03:53.420> how

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
really curly but without changing how

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.820 
really curly but without changing how
that<00:03:54.380> curl<00:03:54.860> would<00:03:55.250> look<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.330> makes<00:03:56.570> sense

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
that curl would look if that makes sense

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.370 
that curl would look if that makes sense
so<00:03:57.830> all<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.519> these<00:03:58.640> gels<00:03:58.970> are<00:03:59.360> my<00:03:59.840> favorites

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
so all of these gels are my favorites

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.290 
so all of these gels are my favorites
and<00:04:00.650> they're<00:04:01.310> pretty<00:04:01.459> much<00:04:01.670> like<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.060> holy

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
and they're pretty much like the holy

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.050 
and they're pretty much like the holy
grail<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:03.140> any<00:04:03.920> gels<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.519> I'm<00:04:04.610> going<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.850> use

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
grail of any gels that I'm going to use

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.030 
grail of any gels that I'm going to use
and<00:04:05.360> out<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.750> all<00:04:06.080> of<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.380> forward<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:06.830> one

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
and out of all of the forward this one

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.970 
and out of all of the forward this one
has<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.400> strongest<00:04:07.790> hold<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:09.769> one

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
has the strongest hold but this one

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.400 
has the strongest hold but this one
right<00:04:10.130> here<00:04:10.540> since<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:11.810> kind<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.080> expensive

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
right here since it is kind of expensive

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.120 
right here since it is kind of expensive
I<00:04:12.739> don't<00:04:12.880> use<00:04:13.880> it<00:04:14.090> as<00:04:14.300> much<00:04:14.330> but<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.739> this

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
I don't use it as much but this is this

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.860 
I don't use it as much but this is this
is<00:04:16.310> what<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.459> have<00:04:16.669> in<00:04:16.820> my<00:04:16.940> hair<00:04:17.120> right<00:04:17.150> now<00:04:17.390> and

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
is what I have in my hair right now and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.550 
is what I have in my hair right now and
this<00:04:18.709> one<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.250> has

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
this one it has

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.310 
this one it has
really<00:04:19.950> low<00:04:20.130> pH<00:04:20.519> lower<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.510> think<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.049> one<00:04:22.230> is

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
really low pH lower I think this one is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.090 
really low pH lower I think this one is
like<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.470> 4.5<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.669> then<00:04:23.910> these<00:04:24.690> are<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.830> 5

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
like a 4.5 and then these are like a 5

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.810 
like a 4.5 and then these are like a 5
okay<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.770> without<00:04:28.770> keeping<00:04:29.310> myself<00:04:29.430> and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
okay so without keeping myself and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.000 
okay so without keeping myself and
rambling<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.450> like<00:04:31.110> all<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.410> those<00:04:31.680> gels

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
rambling I like all of those gels

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.210 
rambling I like all of those gels
because<00:04:32.580> they<00:04:33.210> give<00:04:33.419> me<00:04:33.660> great<00:04:34.110> hold<00:04:34.560> they

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
because they give me great hold they

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.080 
because they give me great hold they
make<00:04:35.490> my<00:04:35.669> hair<00:04:35.940> very<00:04:36.630> shiny<00:04:37.580> my<00:04:38.580> hair<00:04:38.820> isn't

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
make my hair very shiny my hair isn't

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.659 
make my hair very shiny my hair isn't
dry<00:04:39.600> when<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.110> use<00:04:40.320> those<00:04:40.560> gels<00:04:40.919> which<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.430> also

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
dry when I use those gels which is also

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.250 
dry when I use those gels which is also
something<00:04:42.030> that's<00:04:42.210> really<00:04:42.570> important<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.110> me

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
something that's really important to me

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.080 
something that's really important to me
it's<00:04:43.410> not<00:04:43.530> having<00:04:43.919> dry<00:04:44.130> hair<00:04:44.430> like<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.790> want<00:04:45.000> to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
it's not having dry hair like I want to

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.840 
it's not having dry hair like I want to
be<00:04:45.180> able<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:46.500> know<00:04:46.620> fill<00:04:47.010> my<00:04:47.250> hair<00:04:47.550> and

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.140 
be able to you know fill my hair and
it's<00:04:48.180> not<00:04:48.360> hard<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:50.250> still<00:04:50.490> feels<00:04:50.669> soft

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
it's not hard and it still feels soft

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.950 
it's not hard and it still feels soft
and<00:04:52.340> for<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.400> most<00:04:53.550> part<00:04:53.669> they<00:04:54.270> all<00:04:54.600> do<00:04:54.930> a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
and for the most part they all do a

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.620 
and for the most part they all do a
really<00:04:55.290> good<00:04:55.410> job<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.740> defining<00:04:56.280> both<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.540> the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
like to use what gels work for you

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.110 
like to use what gels work for you
because<00:05:09.440> what<00:05:10.440> gels<00:05:10.770> work<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.340> my<00:05:11.580> hair<00:05:11.850> may

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
because what gels work and my hair may

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.390 
because what gels work and my hair may
not<00:05:12.300> necessarily<00:05:12.479> work<00:05:13.229> in<00:05:13.500> other<00:05:14.010> people's

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
not necessarily work in other people's

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.190 
not necessarily work in other people's
hair<00:05:14.639> you<00:05:15.060> know<00:05:15.180> sometimes<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:15.900> can<00:05:16.050> get

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
hair you know sometimes you can get

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.900 
hair you know sometimes you can get
really<00:05:16.530> good<00:05:16.680> results<00:05:16.740> with<00:05:17.250> eco<00:05:17.520> styler<00:05:17.790> gel

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
really good results with eco styler gel

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.210 
really good results with eco styler gel
but<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:18.900> me<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.380> doesn't<00:05:19.410> really<00:05:19.800> do<00:05:20.040> a<00:05:20.070> whole

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
but for me it doesn't really do a whole

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.390 
but for me it doesn't really do a whole
lot<00:05:20.460> for<00:05:21.200> everything<00:05:22.200> that's<00:05:22.500> all<00:05:22.800> up<00:05:23.010> here
