00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
this is our augmented reality mode it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.870 
this is our augmented reality mode it's
also<00:01:53.000> very<00:01:53.719> smart<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.649> has<00:01:54.860> components<00:01:55.280> inside

that<00:01:56.210> detects<00:01:56.719> speed<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.320> direction<00:01:57.439> which

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
that detects speed and direction which

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.940 
that detects speed and direction which
makes<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.670> navigate<00:01:59.179> even<00:01:59.659> indoors<00:02:00.289> without<00:02:00.920> a

all it gives the unique real-time
feeling<00:02:09.440> since<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.830> recognizes<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.610> speed

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
feeling since it recognizes the speed

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.210
