00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.760

 all vacation run and look for swimming trunks 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.400
 where to buy them second is the handkerchiefs and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.780
 the third is again masonry actually 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.600

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.010
 from where to which country and why you 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.140

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.730
 corners so if suddenly you drive along 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.680

 if you have really small breasts 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.530

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.660
 You can visually correct this. 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.280
 disadvantage firstly expand and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.480
 them wide with your hips and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.520
 visually reduce the hips for this can 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.350
 serve pay longitudinal stripes 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.120
 or a jacket that you will not be on yourself 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.560
