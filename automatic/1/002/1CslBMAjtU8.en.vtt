of calories not too many and not too few
so<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> mean<00:01:20.549> by<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.170> what<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.650> face

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so what do I mean by that what your face

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.670 
so what do I mean by that what your face
-<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.640> looking<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.299> low

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
- you're looking at a very low

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
- you're looking at a very low
restricted<00:01:25.680> calorie<00:01:26.100> count<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.119> about

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
restricted calorie count which is about

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.130 
restricted calorie count which is about
500<00:01:28.020> per<00:01:28.590> day<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.840> stay

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
500 per day so you want to really stay

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
500 per day so you want to really stay
between<00:01:31.350> 500<00:01:32.130> calories<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:32.939> 530

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
between 500 calories to about 530

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.819 
between 500 calories to about 530
calories<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.799> far<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:36.210> intake<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> some

calories as far as your intake and some

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.950 
calories as far as your intake and some
people<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.119> lower<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
people think that if they go lower you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.580 
people think that if they go lower you
know<00:01:40.079> into<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.670> 450s<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:42.060> 4<00:01:42.299> 70s<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.380> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
know into the 450s to 4 70s then that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
know into the 450s to 4 70s then that
will<00:01:43.710> help<00:01:43.920> speed<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> process<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
will help speed up the process but that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
will help speed up the process but that
actually<00:01:45.840> won't<00:01:46.170> that'll<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> Plateau

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
actually won't that'll make you Plateau

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
actually won't that'll make you Plateau
it<00:01:47.880> will<00:01:47.970> make<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.270> body<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.630> into<00:01:49.049> a

it will make your body go into a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
it will make your body go into a
starvation<00:01:49.590> mode<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:50.970> getting

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
starvation mode because it's not getting

I've got a lot of that information all
over<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.950> place<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.730> my<00:02:24.940> blog<00:02:25.180> rather<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
over the place on my blog rather the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.979 
over the place on my blog rather the
last<00:02:27.310> thing<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.790> would<00:02:27.850> say<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.569> might<00:02:28.750> want

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
last thing I would say is you might want

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.309 
last thing I would say is you might want
to<00:02:29.050> cut<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.440> any<00:02:30.220> type<00:02:30.550> of<00:02:30.790> alcohol<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.750> also

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
to cut out any type of alcohol and also

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.290 
to cut out any type of alcohol and also
coffee<00:02:32.739> because<00:02:33.310> those<00:02:33.670> two<00:02:33.910> types<00:02:34.180> of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
coffee because those two types of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.330 
coffee because those two types of
beverages<00:02:34.810> number<00:02:35.470> one<00:02:35.620> alcohol<00:02:36.069> is<00:02:36.190> not

approved on the diet number 2 coffee

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.240 
approved on the diet number 2 coffee
which<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.420> still<00:02:40.420> I've<00:02:40.600> seen<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.470> through

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
which is still I've seen that through

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
which is still I've seen that through
experience<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:42.970> dealing<00:02:43.209> with<00:02:43.420> other<00:02:43.690> people

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
experience in dealing with other people

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.650 
experience in dealing with other people
and<00:02:44.260> talking<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.580> kind<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.850> inhibits<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and talking to that kind of inhibits the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.410 
and talking to that kind of inhibits the
weight<00:02:47.080> loss<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:48.100> want<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.610> just<00:02:48.760> go<00:02:48.970> herbal

so anyways that's the first thing second

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.170 
so anyways that's the first thing second
thing<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.830> don't<00:02:57.010> get<00:02:57.160> frustrated<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.940> sure

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180

assuming that you're strict and that you
are<00:03:02.110> really<00:03:02.680> really<00:03:02.980> adamant<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.239> following

you're<00:03:07.989> still<00:03:08.260> experience<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:08.950> Plateau<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
you're still experience this Plateau the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.300 
you're still experience this Plateau the
next<00:03:10.720> thing<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:10.959> say<00:03:11.200> have<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> little<00:03:11.799> patience

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
next thing I say have a little patience

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.460 
next thing I say have a little patience
if<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:12.940> only<00:03:13.120> one<00:03:13.420> two<00:03:13.720> maybe<00:03:14.079> even<00:03:14.230> three

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
if it's only one two maybe even three

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.310 
if it's only one two maybe even three
days<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:15.519> probably<00:03:15.700> not<00:03:16.299> a<00:03:16.360> big<00:03:16.660> deal<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.110> lot

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
days it's probably not a big deal a lot

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.620 
days it's probably not a big deal a lot
of<00:03:17.380> people<00:03:17.860> have<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> stair<00:03:18.370> stepper<00:03:18.730> type<00:03:19.450> of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
of people have a stair stepper type of

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.229 
of people have a stair stepper type of
weight-loss<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.769> know<00:03:20.890> kind<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.489> they<00:03:22.090> have

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
weight-loss you know kind of they have

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.880 
weight-loss you know kind of they have
real<00:03:22.630> big<00:03:22.780> weight<00:03:22.989> loss<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.500> two<00:03:23.620> or<00:03:23.709> three

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
real big weight loss for two or three

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.009 
real big weight loss for two or three
days<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.489> then<00:03:24.549> kind<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.000> plateaus<00:03:25.450> off<00:03:25.750> for

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
days and then kind of plateaus off for

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.870 
days and then kind of plateaus off for
two<00:03:26.140> or<00:03:26.260> three<00:03:26.440> days<00:03:26.470> they<00:03:26.799> have<00:03:27.010> big<00:03:27.670> weight

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
two or three days they have big weight

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.150 
two or three days they have big weight
loss<00:03:28.090> for<00:03:28.390> two-three<00:03:28.750> days<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.799> on<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.070> so

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
loss for two-three days and so on and so

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.910 
loss for two-three days and so on and so
forth<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:30.640> if<00:03:31.390> that's<00:03:31.600> not<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.530> you're

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
forth so if that's not you and you're

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.670 
forth so if that's not you and you're
still<00:03:33.220> experiencing<00:03:33.820> this<00:03:33.970> plateau<00:03:34.239> then<00:03:35.170> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
still experiencing this plateau then the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.160 
still experiencing this plateau then the
solution<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:37.060> an<00:03:37.180> apple<00:03:37.690> day<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.140> a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
solution is have an apple day so a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.620 
solution is have an apple day so a
phase-two<00:03:38.530> apple<00:03:39.160> day<00:03:39.310> or<00:03:39.610> have<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.940> phase<00:03:40.269> two

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
phase-two apple day or have a phase two

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.020 
phase-two apple day or have a phase two
mini-state<00:03:41.410> date<00:03:41.709> but<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.220> steak<00:03:42.640> day<00:03:42.880> is

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
mini-state date but that steak day is

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
is going to really help alleviate or

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.010 
is going to really help alleviate or
reduce<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.180> water<00:04:37.360> weight<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.870> you're

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
reduce the water weight that you're

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.560 
reduce the water weight that you're
still<00:04:38.229> retaining<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.669> will<00:04:39.850> speed<00:04:40.419> up<00:04:40.540> the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
still retaining and it will speed up the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.870 
still retaining and it will speed up the
process<00:04:40.690> of<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.530> fat<00:04:41.740> loss<00:04:41.979> as<00:04:42.250> well<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.729> so

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
process of the fat loss as well and so

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.840 
process of the fat loss as well and so
that's<00:04:43.540> number<00:04:43.900> one<00:04:44.199> number<00:04:44.410> two<00:04:44.979> is<00:04:45.370> if<00:04:45.610> that

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
that's number one number two is if that

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.240 
that's number one number two is if that
still<00:04:46.150> doesn't<00:04:46.180> work<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.350> still<00:04:47.650> two<00:04:48.100> or

a lot of people nobody has ever done a
steak<00:05:35.830> day<00:05:36.039> that<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.310> know<00:05:36.460> on<00:05:36.970> phase<00:05:37.570> two<00:05:37.870> that

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
steak day that I know on phase two that

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.440 
steak day that I know on phase two that
I've<00:05:38.229> suggested<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:39.400> break<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.760> plateau<00:05:40.000> with

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
I've suggested to break the plateau with

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.080 
I've suggested to break the plateau with
an<00:05:40.599> apple<00:05:40.960> day<00:05:41.110> because<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:42.130> just<00:05:42.280> it<00:05:42.729> helps

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
an apple day because it just it helps

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.000 
an apple day because it just it helps
and<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.570> breaks<00:05:43.780> it<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.080> they<00:05:44.139> just<00:05:44.349> keep<00:05:44.860> on

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
and it breaks it and they just keep on

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.219 
and it breaks it and they just keep on
and<00:05:45.310> keep<00:05:45.550> progressing<00:05:45.700> and<00:05:46.330> lose<00:05:46.810> tons<00:05:47.080> of

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
and keep progressing and lose tons of

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.810 
and keep progressing and lose tons of
weight<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:49.560> right<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:50.590> mean<00:05:50.770> that's<00:05:51.430> a<00:05:51.550> lot<00:05:51.669> of

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
weight so right I mean that's a lot of

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.960 
weight so right I mean that's a lot of
information<00:05:52.060> I<00:05:52.740> guess<00:05:53.740> that's<00:05:54.010> it<00:05:54.220> that's<00:05:54.789> the

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
information I guess that's it that's the

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.219
