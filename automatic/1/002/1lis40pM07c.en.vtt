seven people so I saw this art form it's
just<00:00:30.720> small<00:00:31.109> different<00:00:32.009> large<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:33.559> different

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
just small different large of different

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.630

design<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.460> just

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
design but I just

00:00:37.640 --> 00:02:02.210 
design but I just
Barney's<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.879> think<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:41.750> dollars<00:00:42.750> or

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:25.250 

I<00:02:20.810> think<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.700> J<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.970> E<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.750> P

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I think this is the J and E and P

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.770 
I think this is the J and E and P
firstly<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:29.240> instructions<00:02:30.240> so

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
firstly so there's the instructions so

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:41.780 
firstly so there's the instructions so
oh<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:34.080> need<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:38.450> six<00:02:39.450> colors<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:41.520> done
