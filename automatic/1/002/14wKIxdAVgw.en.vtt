00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.550
 comes in such a nice package 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.720
 not specified 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.849
 maximum light output which 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 gives out a lantern it makes 500 lumen 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:36.780
 depicted the lantern itself let's open 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:42.090
 packaging let's see what's inside inside 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.179
 volt 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:41.270
 It is worth noting immediately that in this 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:45.129
 the adapter uses an LED which 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:50.349
 is a charging indicator 

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:53.899

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:31.160
 let's take a closer look myself 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.280
 flashlight means flashlight there is a button 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.650
 power on off button not 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.930
 tactical to enable 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.600
 the lantern must be pressed until it clicks 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.630
 modes are switched 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.350
 when the lantern is already turned on just 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.970
 by pressing this off button 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:00.050
 also drowning the button until it clicks 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.710
 there is such a knob with 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.420
 by which the focus is adjusted 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.150
 luminous flux you can do 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:14.830
 a small point can make a big 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:18.490
 a spot for near some purposes. 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.490
 respectively for distant 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.150
 put the battery 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:53.200

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:53.200
 lumen and economical mode 250 lumen 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.470
 here is the battery charge slot 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.349
 plug adapter into it 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.349
 the adapter itself is a power outlet 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.780
 very convenient no need to extract 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:29.199
 battery from the case as in others 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.800
 like flashlights it charges 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.659
 directly in the body is such 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.229
 rezinochka which closes this 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:40.229
 connector to avoid getting there 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:47.800
 moisture and dust 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:50.430
 lantern body anodized it in the area 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.550
 here's such a grip 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.550
 corrugated surface 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:03.490
 you can confidently hold it in your hand and 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.539
 not afraid that he will slip out if your 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.539

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.400
