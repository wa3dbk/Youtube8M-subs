chemistry<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.660> wrong<00:03:12.840> position

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
chemistry and in the wrong position

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680 
chemistry and in the wrong position
which<00:03:13.550> obviously<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.670> big<00:03:14.820> factor<00:03:15.030> though<00:03:15.210> we

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
which obviously a big factor though we

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.750 
which obviously a big factor though we
got<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.170> deck<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.470> cards<00:03:16.710> again<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.580> if

got the deck of cards again and see if

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.430 
got the deck of cards again and see if
we<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.000> get<00:03:18.090> another<00:03:18.300> player<00:03:18.630> which<00:03:19.110> will<00:03:19.320> be

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
we can get another player which will be

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.010

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
ridiculous this is proving like my

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.250 
ridiculous this is proving like my
entire<00:05:01.280> game<00:05:01.730> but<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:02.390> get<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.600> bit<00:05:02.810> like<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.200> know

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
entire game but we get a bit like I know

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.780 
entire game but we get a bit like I know
how<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.740> happened<00:05:04.070> like<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.190> looked<00:05:04.490> like<00:05:04.640> he

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
how it happened like it looked like he

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.760 
how it happened like it looked like he
pushed<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.240> ball<00:05:05.450> out<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.870> me<00:05:05.990> that<00:05:06.170> looked

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
pushed the ball out to me that looked

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.740 
pushed the ball out to me that looked
like<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.920> weird<00:05:07.220> glitch<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:08.030> probably<00:05:08.480> wasn't

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
like a weird glitch that probably wasn't

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.420 
like a weird glitch that probably wasn't
meant<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.170> happen<00:05:09.350> as<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.100> can<00:05:10.190> see<00:05:10.310> how

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
meant to happen as you can see how

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.580 
meant to happen as you can see how
dominating<00:05:10.970> those<00:05:11.120> shots<00:05:11.420> should<00:05:12.410> have

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
dominating those shots should have

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.960 
dominating those shots should have
probably<00:05:12.860> got<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.190> few<00:05:13.400> more<00:05:13.490> girls<00:05:13.640> in<00:05:13.790> there

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970

player I think it's easier though when
it<00:05:30.470> makes<00:05:30.560> more<00:05:30.710> sense<00:05:30.770> but<00:05:31.190> hope<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.610> have

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730
