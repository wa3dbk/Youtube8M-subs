00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 

you<00:00:59.310> know<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.610> then<00:00:59.730> i<00:00:59.880> take<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.270> pieces<00:01:00.540> from

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you know and then i take my pieces from

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.670 
you know and then i take my pieces from
their<00:01:01.190> sin<00:01:02.190> formed<00:01:02.550> by<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> particular

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
their sin formed by that particular

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.120 
their sin formed by that particular
sound<00:01:04.680> by<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.100> particular<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> motif

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
sound by that particular you know motif

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.050 
sound by that particular you know motif
and<00:01:08.720> tones<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> quality<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.620> i<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.370> i<00:01:11.550> like

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and tones and quality and i think i like

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180 
and tones and quality and i think i like
to<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.660> my<00:01:12.840> music<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.350> way<00:01:13.500> more

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
to really think my music that way more

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.700 
to really think my music that way more
as<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> composer<00:01:15.360> rather<00:01:15.750> than<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.290> say<00:01:16.320> oh

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
as a composer rather than just to say oh

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.830 
as a composer rather than just to say oh
I'm<00:01:17.040> gonna<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.700> bebop<00:01:18.000> tune<00:01:18.300> 11<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> do

within<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.080> integrate<00:01:22.530> whatever<00:01:24.260> you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
within that I can integrate whatever you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.890 
within that I can integrate whatever you
know<00:01:25.410> rhythmic<00:01:26.010> aspect<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.030> wanting<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.780> hear

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
know rhythmic aspect I wanting to hear

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.320 
know rhythmic aspect I wanting to hear
from<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.680> traditional<00:01:29.250> isn't<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> interesting

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
from my traditional isn't it interesting

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.590 
from my traditional isn't it interesting
how<00:01:31.550> Beethoven<00:01:32.550> lends<00:01:32.790> itself<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.330> these

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
how Beethoven lends itself to these

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.880 
how Beethoven lends itself to these
modern<00:01:34.020> loops<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:35.580> taking<00:01:36.030> these<00:01:36.890> baselines

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
modern loops to taking these baselines

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.790 
modern loops to taking these baselines
and<00:01:38.160> looping<00:01:39.030> them<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> almost<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
and looping them it almost in that in

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.740 
and looping them it almost in that in
that<00:01:40.830> Cuban<00:01:41.580> tradition<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.330> were<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that Cuban tradition that you were you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.570 
that Cuban tradition that you were you
were<00:01:42.840> showing<00:01:43.080> us<00:01:43.290> earlier<00:01:43.710> yeah<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.399> then

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
were showing us earlier yeah and then

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.400 
were showing us earlier yeah and then
and<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:44.910> in<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.300> this<00:01:45.690> piece<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.200> just

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
and then in this this piece is just

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.920 
and then in this this piece is just
basically<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:48.360> particular

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
basically when I when I this particular

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.260 
basically when I when I this particular
motif<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.190> exactly<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.090> said

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
motif you know is it exactly as you said

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.530 
motif you know is it exactly as you said
when<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.050> do<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.530> normally<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> check<00:01:54.390> our

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
when I do it normally I put a check our

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.170 
when I do it normally I put a check our
data<00:01:54.690> on<00:01:54.930> top<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.850> which<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.970> very

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
data on top of it which is very

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.609 
data on top of it which is very
beautiful<00:01:57.330> because<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.080> know<00:01:58.200> since<00:01:58.500> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
beautiful because the you know since you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:07.740 
beautiful because the you know since you
have<00:01:58.830> this<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:02.190> if<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.550> a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.690 

and<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.869> fits<00:02:09.800> beautifully<00:02:10.129> with<00:02:10.519> that

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and it fits beautifully with that

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
and it fits beautifully with that
particular<00:02:11.090> line<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.780> with<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.140> base<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
particular line and with the base the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.259 
particular line and with the base the
triplets<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.099> and<00:02:13.459> all<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.879> that<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.120> just

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
triplets and and all of that is just

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.300 
triplets and and all of that is just
like<00:02:14.569> yeah<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.810> mean<00:02:14.959> that's<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> art<00:02:16.160> of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
like yeah I mean that's the art of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.830 
like yeah I mean that's the art of
composition<00:02:16.940> right<00:02:17.120> there<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.510> that's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
composition right there and that's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320 
composition right there and that's
that's<00:02:18.379> what<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> aspire<00:02:19.160> my<00:02:19.580> music<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.000> well<00:02:20.150> to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that's what I aspire my music as well to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.220 
that's what I aspire my music as well to
be<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:22.459> open<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.690> compositions<00:02:24.140> that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
be that open that the compositions that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.990 
be that open that the compositions that
opened<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.799> it<00:02:24.950> really<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:25.519> can<00:02:25.760> do
