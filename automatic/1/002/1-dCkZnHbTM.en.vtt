five now ultra durable five technology

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.390 
five now ultra durable five technology
we're<00:00:17.930> actually<00:00:18.080> using<00:00:18.260> high<00:00:18.890> current

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
we're actually using high current

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.279 
we're actually using high current
capable<00:00:19.820> components<00:00:20.330> for<00:00:20.480> our<00:00:20.600> CPU<00:00:21.050> power

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
capable components for our CPU power

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.220 
capable components for our CPU power
zone<00:00:22.480> first<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:23.599> all<00:00:23.660> I<00:00:23.720> want<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.019> introduce

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
zone first of all I want to introduce

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.050 
zone first of all I want to introduce
one<00:00:24.619> of<00:00:24.710> those<00:00:24.830> components<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.609> this<00:00:25.789> is<00:00:25.970> our

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
one of those components and this is our

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.179 
one of those components and this is our
IR<00:00:27.039> 3550<00:00:28.039> power<00:00:28.730> stage<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:29.960> this<00:00:30.169> is<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.650> power

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
IR 3550 power stage so this is a power

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.720 
IR 3550 power stage so this is a power
stage<00:00:31.609> from<00:00:32.150> international<00:00:32.870> rectifier<00:00:33.730> we're

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
stage from international rectifier we're

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.310 
stage from international rectifier we're
actually<00:00:34.820> using<00:00:35.060> these<00:00:35.480> these<00:00:35.840> are<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.110> first

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
actually using these these are the first

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.110 
actually using these these are the first
time<00:00:36.620> any<00:00:36.829> motherboard<00:00:37.340> has<00:00:37.370> featured<00:00:37.820> these

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
time any motherboard has featured these

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.320 
time any motherboard has featured these
these<00:00:38.420> power<00:00:38.690> power<00:00:39.680> stages<00:00:40.220> now<00:00:41.030> they're

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
these power power stages now they're

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.020 
these power power stages now they're
rated<00:00:41.540> up<00:00:41.840> to<00:00:41.870> 60<00:00:42.380> amps<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:44.000> actually

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
rated up to 60 amps so that actually

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.140 
rated up to 60 amps so that actually
able<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.110> provide<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:45.650> lot<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:45.950> current<00:00:46.430> for<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
able to provide a lot of current for the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.020 
able to provide a lot of current for the
CPU<00:00:47.950> now<00:00:48.950> briefly<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:49.370> want<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.640> describe<00:00:49.880> what

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
CPU now briefly I want to describe what

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.360 
CPU now briefly I want to describe what
the<00:00:50.120> difference<00:00:50.450> between<00:00:50.600> power<00:00:51.350> stages<00:00:52.070> and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the difference between power stages and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.400 
the difference between power stages and
versus<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.790> traditional<00:00:52.850> most<00:00:53.480> fit<00:00:53.720> so

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
versus a traditional most fit so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.530 
versus a traditional most fit so
obviously<00:00:54.830> a<00:00:54.950> traditional<00:00:55.580> most<00:00:55.820> fit<00:00:56.060> it<00:00:56.240> has

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
obviously a traditional most fit it has

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.450 
obviously a traditional most fit it has
many<00:00:56.810> different<00:00:56.990> components<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:58.040> these<00:00:58.310> are

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
many different components and these are

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.430 
many different components and these are
all<00:00:58.610> separate<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.360> have<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.690> driver<00:00:59.930> IC

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
all separate so you have the driver IC

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.770 
all separate so you have the driver IC
high<00:01:00.980> side<00:01:01.280> most<00:01:01.550> fit<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:01.970> two<00:01:02.330> low<00:01:02.540> side

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
high side most fit and two low side

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.840 
high side most fit and two low side
mosasaur<00:01:03.530> maybe<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.100> have<00:01:04.189> all<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.549> these

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
mosasaur maybe so you have all of these

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.390 
mosasaur maybe so you have all of these
components<00:01:05.030> onto<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.780> motherboard<00:01:06.259> so<00:01:06.890> they're

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
components onto a motherboard so they're

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.430 
components onto a motherboard so they're
bigger<00:01:07.670> components<00:01:08.420> they<00:01:08.659> take<00:01:08.869> up<00:01:08.900> much<00:01:09.170> more

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
bigger components they take up much more

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.320 
bigger components they take up much more
space<00:01:09.800> on<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.130> motherboard<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.730> also

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
space on the motherboard and also

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.670 
space on the motherboard and also
they're<00:01:11.510> less<00:01:11.690> efficient<00:01:12.230> because<00:01:12.380> there's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
they're less efficient because there's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.670 
they're less efficient because there's
more<00:01:13.120> electrical<00:01:14.120> waste<00:01:14.390> from<00:01:15.260> all<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.530> these

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
more electrical waste from all of these

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.640 
more electrical waste from all of these
components<00:01:16.600> now<00:01:17.600> we're<00:01:17.840> using<00:01:18.050> like<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.440> said

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
components now we're using like I said

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.610 
components now we're using like I said
that<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.250> power<00:01:19.550> stage<00:01:19.940> from<00:01:20.240> ir<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:21.590> a

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
that the power stage from ir this is a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.100 
that the power stage from ir this is a
all-in-one<00:01:22.010> design<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.390> got<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
all-in-one design so it's got the the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.110 
all-in-one design so it's got the the
driver<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.830> high<00:01:24.980> side<00:01:25.220> low<00:01:25.400> side<00:01:25.640> Mo's<00:01:25.850> all

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
driver the high side low side Mo's all

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.230 
driver the high side low side Mo's all
in<00:01:26.420> one<00:01:26.630> single<00:01:26.870> package<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.210> a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
in one single package and this is a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.020 
in one single package and this is a
power<00:01:29.510> stage<00:01:29.930> versus<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.470> driver<00:01:30.860> most<00:01:31.250> fit<00:01:31.520> now

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
power stage versus a driver most fit now

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.790 
power stage versus a driver most fit now
driver<00:01:32.390> most<00:01:32.690> fit<00:01:32.960> has<00:01:33.260> all<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.650> these

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
driver most fit has all of these

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.230 
driver most fit has all of these
different<00:01:33.920> components<00:01:34.220> in<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.729> single<00:01:35.060> package

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
different components in a single package

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.930 
different components in a single package
but<00:01:35.990> they're<00:01:36.170> all<00:01:36.290> manufactured<00:01:37.190> by<00:01:37.520> adding

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
but they're all manufactured by adding

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.420 
but they're all manufactured by adding
separate<00:01:38.300> pieces<00:01:38.510> but<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.380> power<00:01:39.590> stage<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.370> a

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
separate pieces but the power stage is a

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.940 
separate pieces but the power stage is a
much<00:01:40.760> more<00:01:40.970> advanced<00:01:41.600> manufacturing<00:01:41.950> process

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
much more advanced manufacturing process

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.070 
much more advanced manufacturing process
because<00:01:43.580> they<00:01:43.700> actually<00:01:44.090> manufactured<00:01:44.930> like

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
because they actually manufactured like

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.910 
because they actually manufactured like
a<00:01:45.110> silicone<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.670> each<00:01:46.970> layer<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.380> most<00:01:48.620> fit

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
a silicone so each layer of the most fit

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.330 
a silicone so each layer of the most fit
is<00:01:49.190> made<00:01:49.670> from<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.659> are<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.740> means<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
is made from I are so that means the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240 
is made from I are so that means the
driver<00:01:52.640> itself<00:01:53.299> is<00:01:53.570> made<00:01:53.900> from<00:01:54.170> ir<00:01:54.620> as<00:01:54.920> well<00:01:55.130> as

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
driver itself is made from ir as well as

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.760 
driver itself is made from ir as well as
all<00:01:55.400> of<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.670> other<00:01:55.700> components<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.620> is

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
all of the other components so this is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.190 
all of the other components so this is
actually<00:01:57.920> able<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.430> provide<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.670> much<00:01:58.970> more<00:01:59.270> low

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
actually able to provide a much more low

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.490 
actually able to provide a much more low
power<00:02:01.000> operation<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.780> we're<00:02:02.930> actually<00:02:03.170> seeing

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
power operation so we're actually seeing

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.050 
power operation so we're actually seeing
up<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.770> ninety<00:02:04.040> five<00:02:04.190> percent<00:02:04.250> peak

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
up to ninety five percent peak

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.930 
up to ninety five percent peak
efficiency<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:06.290> very<00:02:06.770> little<00:02:07.100> electrical

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
efficiency so very little electrical

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.270 
efficiency so very little electrical
waste<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.049> very<00:02:09.349> low<00:02:09.560> temperature<00:02:10.099> as<00:02:10.250> well

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
waste and very low temperature as well

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.449 
waste and very low temperature as well
that<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> traditional<00:02:11.750> motherboard<00:02:12.230> design<00:02:12.620> so

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
that a traditional motherboard design so

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.000 
that a traditional motherboard design so
we're<00:02:13.579> also<00:02:13.730> using<00:02:13.879> other<00:02:14.389> high<00:02:14.629> quality

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
we're also using other high quality

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.270 
we're also using other high quality
capacity<00:02:16.640> high-current<00:02:17.349> parts<00:02:18.349> we're<00:02:19.099> using

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
capacity high-current parts we're using

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.819 
capacity high-current parts we're using
high<00:02:19.640> current<00:02:20.150> chokes<00:02:20.420> these<00:02:21.319> are<00:02:21.500> high

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
high current chokes these are high

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.890 
high current chokes these are high
current<00:02:22.549> ferrite<00:02:23.030> core<00:02:23.269> chokes<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:23.780> they're

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
current ferrite core chokes and they're

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.410 
current ferrite core chokes and they're
rated<00:02:24.049> up<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.319> 60<00:02:24.739> amps<00:02:25.010> as<00:02:25.159> well<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.209> also

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
rated up to 60 amps as well and we also

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.830 
rated up to 60 amps as well and we also
have<00:02:26.870> our<00:02:26.900> signature<00:02:27.680> 2x<00:02:28.549> copper<00:02:29.000> PCB<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
have our signature 2x copper PCB in the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.170 
have our signature 2x copper PCB in the
motherboard<00:02:30.319> as<00:02:30.439> well<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.340> obviously<00:02:31.879> if

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
motherboard as well so obviously if

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.270 
motherboard as well so obviously if
you're<00:02:32.329> using<00:02:32.569> higher<00:02:32.900> current<00:02:33.409> capable

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
you're using higher current capable

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.280 
you're using higher current capable
components<00:02:34.909> that<00:02:35.329> means<00:02:35.569> more<00:02:35.780> power<00:02:36.019> is

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
components that means more power is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.720 
components that means more power is
going<00:02:36.440> through<00:02:36.739> your<00:02:36.890> system<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.700> you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
going through your system so you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.280 
going through your system so you
actually<00:02:37.970> have<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.750> pathway<00:02:39.230> to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
actually have to have the pathway to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.930 
actually have to have the pathway to
support<00:02:39.860> those<00:02:39.950> higher<00:02:40.190> currents<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.760> well

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
support those higher currents as well

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.240 
support those higher currents as well
that's<00:02:41.659> why<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.989> have<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.440> 2<00:02:42.620> ounce<00:02:42.769> copper

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
that's why we have the 2 ounce copper

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.509 
that's why we have the 2 ounce copper
PCB<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.569> only<00:02:44.720> does<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.079> provide<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.430> know

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
PCB so not only does it provide you know

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.190 
PCB so not only does it provide you know
sort<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.879> giant<00:02:47.180> heatsink<00:02:47.810> within<00:02:48.109> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
sort of a giant heatsink within the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.589 
sort of a giant heatsink within the
motherboard<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.190> also<00:02:49.340> allows<00:02:49.819> us<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.269> use

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
motherboard but it also allows us to use

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.780 
motherboard but it also allows us to use
these<00:02:50.750> higher<00:02:50.989> current<00:02:51.409> parts<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.579> front

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
these higher current parts so in front

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.690 
these higher current parts so in front
of<00:02:52.849> us<00:02:52.970> we<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.390> three<00:02:54.170> demo<00:02:54.620> systems<00:02:55.250> we're

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
of us we have three demo systems we're

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300 
of us we have three demo systems we're

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
stage ultra durable five so this demo we

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.229 
stage ultra durable five so this demo we
wanted<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.650> show<00:03:09.859> off<00:03:09.889> how<00:03:10.670> low<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.120> a

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
wanted to show off how low of a

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.240 
wanted to show off how low of a
temperature<00:03:11.750> actually<00:03:12.079> these<00:03:12.500> power<00:03:12.739> stages

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
temperature actually these power stages

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.030 
temperature actually these power stages
can<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:13.609> so<00:03:14.569> as<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.930> see<00:03:15.109> here<00:03:15.409> on<00:03:15.590> our

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
can get so as you can see here on our

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.460 
can get so as you can see here on our
power<00:03:16.340> meters<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.909> is<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.170> eight

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
power meters this is for the the eight

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.409 
power meters this is for the the eight
phase<00:03:18.829> we're<00:03:19.400> at<00:03:20.139> 95.5<00:03:21.139> degrees<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.269> our

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
phase we're at 95.5 degrees this is our

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.080 
phase we're at 95.5 degrees this is our
sixth<00:03:23.750> phase<00:03:23.900> Deepak<00:03:24.799> design<00:03:25.129> this<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.489> at<00:03:25.609> 98

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
sixth phase Deepak design this is at 98

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.759 
sixth phase Deepak design this is at 98
degrees<00:03:26.449> and<00:03:26.780> then<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.379> gigabyte

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
degrees and then the gigabyte

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.800 
degrees and then the gigabyte
motherboard<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.400> at<00:03:28.549> sixty<00:03:29.000> five<00:03:29.209> point<00:03:29.569> seven

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
motherboard is at sixty five point seven

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.259

working temperature of a single most fit

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.379 
working temperature of a single most fit
as<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.500> can<00:03:39.650> see<00:03:39.799> it's<00:03:40.010> much<00:03:40.340> cooler<00:03:40.609> using

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
as you can see it's much cooler using

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.650 
as you can see it's much cooler using
the<00:03:41.480> ir35<00:03:42.079> 50s<00:03:42.799> power<00:03:43.790> stages<00:03:44.359> than<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
the ir35 50s power stages than the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.080 
the ir35 50s power stages than the
traditional<00:03:44.870> design<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:46.489> that's<00:03:46.669> our<00:03:46.819> ultra

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
traditional design so that's our ultra
