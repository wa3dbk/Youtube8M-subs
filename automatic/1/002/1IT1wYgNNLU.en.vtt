00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.580
 a little background of how i have 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.770
 appeared gray 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.679
 the fact is that of course if you already have 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.549
 half gray head then my advice now 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.970
 they won't help you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.680
 but if it was like that I can 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 be someone to help and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.449
 someone also prevents early gray hair in 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.320
 I had about gray hair 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 when i was 22 and maybe 23 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.970
 i wake up inside one morning 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.910
 my bangs me there two gray hairs and 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.659
 and they sat for some reason not 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's say how are you how do we think 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.600
 I grew up and sit a little bit here at the stone 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.309
 somehow sat at once along the entire length 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.150
 rather, they are the type of hair along the entire length 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.110
 sat down 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.420
 I do not know why this is happening but 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.080
 when gray hair appears apparently 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.140
 turns white and whiter completely I was shocked 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.119
 I think I only have 20 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.400
 to a friend I already had gray hairs ahead 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:11.550
 hair got out and the very first mistake is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.240
 take it and snatch but then I already knew 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.580
 that gray hair cannot be a rabat I think 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 what have you heard about it too 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.050
 hair is by no means impossible 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.000
 pull the cause I don't know because 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.790
 I am not a doctor how it works but I read 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 somehow on the internet that bulbs are gray 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.680
 hair has some kind of acid if its 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.770
 snatch it sprinkles and can 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.370
 infect other hairs and they too will 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.670
 gray 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.240
 I don't know if it's true or not, but I have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.440
 there were several my girlfriends 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 classmates we are the same age who 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.350
 confirmed this fact as when they 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.770
 they pulled out gray hair from them even more 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 there was gray hair next to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.200
 near lying hair and that means 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 the very first thing is not to pull hair 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.040
 and here I am with a fright in general when I saw 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.159
 two gray hairs and I think at the fiesta 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.869
 do i get gray now more 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.350
 Now I have to dye my hair and then I 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.180
 even the hair is not dyed 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.420
 will be natural hair color and me so 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.320
 it became insulting in general, I took the scissors 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.150
 just and i cut them to the root 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.030
 so god forbid during combing 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.760
 do not hook or pull them with a comb 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.890
 or I do not know that they are not shorter 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.990
 I suffered right kid the root of them from 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.600
 arrows 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.240
 then I immediately ran to the pharmacy I 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.270
 thought that even multivitamins and 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.700
 tablets it will be rather weak and I remember 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:49.630
 then I bought vitamins in ampoules injections 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 b1 and b6 at 12 and in general I did a course 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.230
 injections although maybe now it's somehow 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.420
 not popular to make shots I don't know but 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.980
 then with a fright it seemed to me that this 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.830
 right in the blood will be better and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.700
 really know didn't help this 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.940
 complex of 3 vitamins b and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.070
 the fact that I cut the hair at the root and at 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.960
 I did not grow already then the hair they 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.180
 were bang i would them anyway 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.820
 noticed now I also have a natural 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.110
 hair color and you see it but I do not paint 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.790
 and in principle there is no gray hair vodka 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.940
 Well what I want to say I was so 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.300
 twice the first time it was somewhere around 22 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.980
 here so two gray hairs got out 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.340
 after I cut through the vitamins 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.780
 they cut the root they stopped 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.730
 grow gray then this through about three 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.220
 years old again 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.030
 I got two gray hairs out again 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.030
 somewhere and again I did the same thing 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.910
 disappeared again so I think it can 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.840
 it was exactly this that helped me two times already 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.879
 times it happened to me and 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:14.040
 and vitamins are what I set them up yes 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:17.160
 it was an easy way but i don't know well i 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.400
 I forget to say what I think it is 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.250
 happened because of standing saw 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:29.760
 soothing novopassit to 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.949
 calm your nerves and here it is to me 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.280
 helped get rid of gray hair 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.220
 Of course I do not know that it would afford it 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.050
 just I did if I threw them 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.280
 Now I can not give such a forecast 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.740
 maybe someone will benefit from my experience 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.740
 if you suddenly in the morning you find on 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 your slits or go out then in your head a couple 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.160
 gray hair maybe this will help you 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:00.150
 prevent their spread therefore 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.030
 I think I should tell you about it. 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.930
 and share and I hope that you will 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.510
 all beautiful girls you happiness good luck 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.820
 rather end the winter holidays come 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.400
 do you want cheese I spend with us outside the window 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.510
 numbers so much snow piled on it just 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.630
 horror but I want to say it doesn't matter 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.889
 mood and today is good and by the way I 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.020
 cut 7 bangs today it happened 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.510
 because I've always had before 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.760
 such a bang and then I grew it 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.639
 Warriors have seen my videos that I have not 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.190
 there were bangs and then I just think 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.630
 cut off or not cut off and yet 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.639
 cut off and now I feel 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.860
 Much better because Acacia Veselka 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.919
 no i don't like when i have 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.780
 crappy hair 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.620
 rather not a gray wave when there is no bang 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.210
 vanilla somehow bangs she seems to me 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.240
 somehow better to do my hair 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.010
 but I could not honestly put 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.500
 normal hair i hope this video 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.180
 It was at least a little useful for you and 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.729
 I hope that it was interesting by the way 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.520
 it was a video request and 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:15.289
 all wish good luck happiness love of all 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.289
 the very best and all bye
