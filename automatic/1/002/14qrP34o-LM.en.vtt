00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.200
 new festival today sees it in the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.679
 title, of course, is back 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.420
 falls is about the harvester shows 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 you have how to power him and how to do it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.480
 first I show you what you do 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.220
 So, he needs it first 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:27.300
 and paving stone then let's go 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 in here as we do now for the first time 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.730
 the cover in the come if the in the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.559
 extractor estimates that is definitely going 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.610
 Not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 I'm back vacation in Saxony Furness 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.750
 and cattle out what should be since that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 actually enough 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.539
 and this was what we are burning now 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.539
 once in a while we keep it casual 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.239
 and then we need cobblestone 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 normal stone 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.570
 that 's it already here in the stream 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.250
 So I have a tutorial world here 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.770
 Although it obstructed it is nothing 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 but will later it seems to me yes 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.710
 then we need two shears one gold 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.850
 ax then we make the plastic 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:28.560
 plastic difference then we meet so 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 a factory machinery block and then 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.570
 the whole thing is tasted like that and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.560
 that is of course now I have the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:45.149
 forget if we always have a lot yes 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.600
 so so shows the now just as a 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:55.229
 workday so now we go out when 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 I call this the test lab now 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.600
 I call it so now we have 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.939
 the harvester i would say so here 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.110
 down 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.090
 so now he still needs electricity 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.090
 you can with mg and with eu 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.519
 Let's do it with us 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.900
 as well as there is so you see 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.170
 the heat energy is full 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.150
 now the hair must have something like this and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.269
 Plus we take now very easy times 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 a seedling rich seedling 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:43.879
 plant since way we take yet 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:47.629
 more on it and now you will have it 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.709
 pick him up and leave all this here 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.170
 get out dry 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.000
 that now you can of course only if 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.349
 the traffic lights bonner landslide is ever 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 After how much you are just 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.099
 plays and that would be it too 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.299
 so far to harvester forest or better 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.150
 I think that 's it 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.230
 The next tutorial will be that one 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.799
 Blender and then you can do it all 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.409
 connect 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:14.170
 So we are in the next story 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.170
 I am the patriot ep and bye
