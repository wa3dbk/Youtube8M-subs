and if he just he's going to finish off
this<00:01:22.020> wallet<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.530> supply<00:01:22.950> depots<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.820> he<00:01:24.000> can

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
this wallet with supply depots so he can

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.240 
this wallet with supply depots so he can
always<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.510> raise<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.320> let<00:01:25.950> down

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
always just raise that and let down

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.650 
always just raise that and let down
those<00:01:26.940> add-ons<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.630> safe<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.230> while<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.660> I'm

those add-ons be safe for a while so I'm
just<00:01:30.870> continuing<00:01:31.200> through<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.010> he<00:01:32.990> gets<00:01:33.990> his

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
just continuing through this he gets his

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
just continuing through this he gets his
refinery<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.420> puts<00:01:36.630> three<00:01:37.100> SUVs<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.520> as

but<00:01:42.450> he<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.080> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.440> worry<00:01:43.920> too<00:01:43.980> much

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

finish so right when not finishes you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100 
finish so right when not finishes you
should<00:01:50.790> upgrade<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.690> orbital

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
should upgrade this to an orbital

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
should upgrade this to an orbital
command<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> he<00:01:52.710> should<00:01:53.070> start<00:01:53.370> making<00:01:53.430> a

command and he should start making a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
command and he should start making a
marine<00:01:55.430> now<00:01:56.430> instead<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> okay<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> where

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
marine now instead of okay this is where

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.750 
marine now instead of okay this is where
the<00:01:58.500> build<00:01:58.890> starts<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.640> little

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
the build starts to get a little

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.800 
the build starts to get a little
different<00:02:00.420> than<00:02:01.100> really<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.370> normal

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
different than really really normal

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
different than really really normal
because<00:02:03.810> from<00:02:04.740> most<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.250> games<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.490> I've

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
because from most of the games that I've

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.650 
because from most of the games that I've
witnessed<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.870> instead<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.420> building<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
witnessed so instead of building a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
witnessed so instead of building a
second<00:02:10.020> barracks<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.380> he<00:02:10.530> did<00:02:10.740> right<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:11.100> so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
second barracks like he did right now so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
second barracks like he did right now so
like<00:02:11.550> halfway<00:02:11.790> through<00:02:12.300> when<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.690> marine<00:02:12.960> is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
like halfway through when the marine is

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.350 
like halfway through when the marine is
done<00:02:13.880> who<00:02:14.880> started<00:02:15.450> second<00:02:15.870> barracks

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
done who started second barracks

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.910 
done who started second barracks
normally<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.420> would<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:18.959> like<00:02:19.230> an<00:02:19.500> extra

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
normally I would see like an extra

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.729 
normally I would see like an extra
supply<00:02:20.430> depot<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.000> whatnot<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.620> after<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
supply depot or whatnot and after that

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.040 
supply depot or whatnot and after that
first<00:02:23.040> barracks<00:02:23.489> finished<00:02:24.270> he<00:02:24.450> did<00:02:24.660> send<00:02:24.930> out

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
first barracks finished he did send out

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.550 
first barracks finished he did send out
his<00:02:25.260> scouting<00:02:25.620> SCV<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.360> that's<00:02:27.600> pretty

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
his scouting SCV so that's pretty

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.160 
his scouting SCV so that's pretty
interesting<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.400> note<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.730> well<00:02:29.900> now<00:02:30.900> this

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
interesting to note as well now this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.260 
interesting to note as well now this
first<00:02:31.440> marine<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.400> finish<00:02:32.820> popping

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
first marine is going to finish popping

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.309 
first marine is going to finish popping
out<00:02:33.390> right<00:02:33.630> here

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.589 

the<00:02:36.859> first<00:02:37.129> marine<00:02:37.400> pops<00:02:37.609> out<00:02:37.790> she<00:02:37.999> decides<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
the first marine pops out she decides to

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.649 
the first marine pops out she decides to
make<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.049> reactor<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:39.709> its<00:02:39.950> first<00:02:40.159> barracks<00:02:40.659> now

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
make a reactor on its first barracks now

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.860 
make a reactor on its first barracks now
this<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.049> really

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
this is really

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.930 
this is really
because<00:02:43.049> as<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.799> can<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:44.010> vs<00:02:44.580> protoss

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
because as you can see vs protoss

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.570 
because as you can see vs protoss
players<00:02:45.799> he<00:02:46.799> still<00:02:46.830> doesn't<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.489> a

players he still doesn't have a
cybernetics<00:02:48.299> core<00:02:48.569> up<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.049> finished<00:02:49.379> with

cybernetics core up and finished with

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.460 
cybernetics core up and finished with
his<00:02:49.830> standard<00:02:50.280> opener<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:50.730> well<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> he<00:02:52.349> is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
his standard opener as well so he is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.039 
his standard opener as well so he is

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
need to worry too much about any cell

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.229 
need to worry too much about any cell
type<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.319> harassment<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.349> he<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
type of harassment so he is going to

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.809 
type of harassment so he is going to
almost<00:03:09.239> finish<00:03:09.599> up<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:10.140> Wallin<00:03:10.829> with<00:03:11.129> supply

he<00:03:15.670> almost<00:03:16.269> gets<00:03:16.480> applied<00:03:16.750> locked<00:03:17.079> here<00:03:17.290> but

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
he almost gets applied locked here but

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.190 
he almost gets applied locked here but
because<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.010> supply<00:03:18.459> depot<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:19.000> almost<00:03:19.989> going

be done so you should be able to defend
fairly<00:05:09.370> easily<00:05:12.390> he<00:05:13.390> also<00:05:13.690> tried<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.080> make<00:05:14.200> a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
fairly easily he also tried to make a

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.660 
fairly easily he also tried to make a
couple<00:05:14.440> of<00:05:14.590> bunkers<00:05:14.920> there<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.430> didn't

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
couple of bunkers there but it didn't

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.670 
couple of bunkers there but it didn't
work<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.510> this<00:05:16.810> is<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.230> pretty<00:05:17.410> much<00:05:17.650> a

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
work so this is just pretty much a

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.500 
work so this is just pretty much a
standard<00:05:18.040> opening<00:05:18.370> I've<00:05:18.730> seen<00:05:19.000> him<00:05:19.120> use<00:05:19.330> this

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
standard opening I've seen him use this

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.350 
standard opening I've seen him use this
many<00:05:20.110> many<00:05:20.200> times<00:05:20.670> after<00:05:21.670> this<00:05:21.820> he<00:05:22.030> is<00:05:22.060> going

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
many many times after this he is going

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.270 
many many times after this he is going
to<00:05:22.450> be<00:05:22.570> making<00:05:22.720> his<00:05:23.110> factory<00:05:23.560> his<00:05:23.740> second

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
to be making his factory his second

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.110 
to be making his factory his second
refinery<00:05:25.920> also<00:05:26.920> is<00:05:27.130> expanding<00:05:27.700> at<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:27.820> same

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
refinery also is expanding at the same

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.910 
refinery also is expanding at the same
time<00:05:28.360> so<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.170> a<00:05:29.320> really<00:05:29.620> heavy

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
time so this is a really heavy

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.320 
time so this is a really heavy
investment<00:05:30.520> during<00:05:30.700> this<00:05:30.850> time<00:05:31.060> he<00:05:31.090> won't

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
investment during this time he won't

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.110 
investment during this time he won't
have<00:05:31.570> as<00:05:31.780> many<00:05:31.960> units<00:05:32.230> as<00:05:32.590> he<00:05:32.950> would<00:05:33.100> like<00:05:33.880> but

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
have as many units as he would like but

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.410 
have as many units as he would like but
he's<00:05:34.270> still<00:05:34.600> able<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:35.050> produce<00:05:35.230> everything

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
he's still able to produce everything

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.420 
he's still able to produce everything
okay<00:05:37.420> now<00:05:38.110> he<00:05:38.170> does<00:05:38.530> have<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.950> handful<00:05:39.370> of

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
okay now he does have a handful of

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.970 
okay now he does have a handful of
marines<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.090> marauders<00:05:40.350> right<00:05:41.350> here<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:41.830> he

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
marines and marauders right here so he

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.960 
marines and marauders right here so he
should<00:05:42.190> be<00:05:42.340> fine<00:05:42.550> from<00:05:42.730> this<00:05:43.000> three<00:05:43.330> stalker

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
should be fine from this three stalker

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.320 
should be fine from this three stalker
so<00:05:46.950> just<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.040> be<00:05:48.070> safe<00:05:48.340> he<00:05:48.550> is<00:05:48.610> building<00:05:49.060> a

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
so just to be safe he is building a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.530 
so just to be safe he is building a
couple<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.750> bunkers<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:51.190> rampant<00:05:51.910> but<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.330> mean

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
couple of bunkers is rampant but I mean

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.900 
couple of bunkers is rampant but I mean
at<00:05:52.720> this<00:05:52.840> point<00:05:52.930> with<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:53.950> initial<00:05:54.370> push<00:05:54.610> he

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
at this point with that initial push he

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.040 
at this point with that initial push he
already<00:05:55.120> killed<00:05:55.420> 10<00:05:55.780> workers<00:05:56.070> so<00:05:57.810> after<00:05:58.810> then

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
already killed 10 workers so after then

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.590 
already killed 10 workers so after then
um<00:05:59.350> the<00:06:00.010> factory<00:06:00.490> finished<00:06:00.850> he's<00:06:01.120> started

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
um the factory finished he's started

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.050 
um the factory finished he's started
making<00:06:01.870> his<00:06:02.020> starport<00:06:02.560> and<00:06:02.920> reactor<00:06:03.760> on<00:06:03.910> the

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
making his starport and reactor on the

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.490 
making his starport and reactor on the
factory<00:06:04.420> so<00:06:04.570> he<00:06:04.630> can<00:06:04.750> just<00:06:04.870> swap<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.140> and

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
factory so he can just swap that and

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.320 
factory so he can just swap that and
make<00:06:05.650> as<00:06:05.800> many<00:06:06.010> medevacs<00:06:06.520> as<00:06:06.670> possible<00:06:07.120> and

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
make as many medevacs as possible and

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.010 
make as many medevacs as possible and
once<00:06:08.320> those<00:06:08.740> medevacs<00:06:09.490> are<00:06:10.500> finished

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.080 

the<00:06:14.560> two<00:06:14.740> medevacs<00:06:15.009> and<00:06:15.370> that's<00:06:15.610> pretty<00:06:15.940> much

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
the two medevacs and that's pretty much

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.400 
the two medevacs and that's pretty much
just<00:06:16.479> going<00:06:17.349> to<00:06:17.470> be<00:06:17.560> how<00:06:17.680> this<00:06:17.949> strategy<00:06:18.550> works

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
just going to be how this strategy works

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.770 
just going to be how this strategy works
so<00:06:20.410> this<00:06:20.680> opener<00:06:21.340> has<00:06:21.819> worked<00:06:22.060> for<00:06:22.300> many<00:06:22.509> times

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
so this opener has worked for many times

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.589 
so this opener has worked for many times
and<00:06:23.080> he<00:06:23.319> this<00:06:23.680> is<00:06:23.770> pretty<00:06:23.919> much<00:06:24.129> his<00:06:24.340> go-to

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
and he this is pretty much his go-to

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:30.749 
and he this is pretty much his go-to
strategy<00:06:25.599> vs<00:06:25.990> protoss<00:06:26.349> and<00:06:29.580> that's<00:06:30.580> pretty

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
strategy vs protoss and that's pretty

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.230 
strategy vs protoss and that's pretty
much<00:06:30.879> it<00:06:32.039> besides<00:06:33.039> using<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.669> 111

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
much it besides using the 111

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.700 
much it besides using the 111
