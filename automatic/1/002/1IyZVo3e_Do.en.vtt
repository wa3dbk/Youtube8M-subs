00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:22.619
 Today I want to be the brisk one 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.410
 witches rolling oldies bless it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.189
 imagine 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 the features as good as 5 to 20 centimeters 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:40.829
 wide young women a little weak as 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 blowing image reader locally sandy also has 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 another name 90 schuster mushroom the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.120
 Tubes are stupid and rested when you see him 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 touches strike blue strike 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.480
 the game clearly is logical 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:08.689
 meat yellowish hurt him but 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:15.619
 start the same blue to black blue 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.619
 there is very firm in front of you 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:26.880
 usually from june to october in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.439
 foliage and coniferous forest especially and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.700
 beech fishes 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:40.610
 but I usually go to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:44.310
 obligations or forest trails 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.200
 relatively often and can 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.200
 we have confused with net 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.850
 but urban hexene Rehling wherein 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.850
 both a very high food Wertheim 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.659
 Here she is also the women 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.659
 ordered like 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.890
 I have a mushroom that says one 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.670
 cut off from that I think at all 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.430
 Nothing 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.430
 I like the street as clockwise 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.520
 and therefore no matter if you do this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.500
 knowledgeable or not 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.580
 This always gives you the opportunity 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.190
 look like they are completely out of this picture 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.520
 with its root braid with its with 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.110
 ca 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.570
 with his approach and one each 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.990
 you can order book then properly 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.770
 look up siegerbild as if I were 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.880
 I took the earth 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.160
 that makes and covers the same again 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.240
 by the fact that I am the one who made the effort 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.550
 mycelium is now embossed as a wander 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.640
 I do it with it as well as with it 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.739
 ask to grow from the market and then has 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.040
 the possibility of several times a year 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.040
 to find the mushrooms again 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.220
 a very nice feature you can see now 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:26.220
 put pressure on whether it looks now 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.190
 turns slowly blue and that is 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:35.940
 the typical characteristic of the witch's pipe 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:40.500
 on the left is the lining in the left 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.220
 its dark red almost all the color on 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.610
 outer edge duration and there you see 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:52.459
 slight yellow approach and then you can 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.320
 they feature the this the fotoprojekt 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.670
 you can see the fingerprint now 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.560
 me as the dark blue and will be 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.240
 german sign of ex rolling 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.020
 shoemaker mushrooms 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.970
 if you clean them now and service 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:19.010
 Power will be taken with airbag then 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.010
 first comes the yellow color 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:32.710
 because now you can already see how 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:36.220
 the whole display have lische profi and 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 now you can where this clearly 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.310
 Proof and you have the proof that 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:50.020
 you RÃ¶hrling here hexene this or 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:55.840
 schuster fungus still has a boxer job 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.610
 and are the mushrooms and are ready 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.750
 snipped so in slices 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.840
 cut then I do that so that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.290
 I need it so fresh without 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.130
 blanch building and then whole 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:15.090
 Anyway, ready to go are snipped 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.570
 then come in the finger and then 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.280
 completely mixed with other mushrooms and 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.280
 Should I then something for the main course 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.570
 then I use in which I use 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.060
 they come across eleven 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:33.490
 these pictures in the frozen state 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.100
 then I'll call myself a whole 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.620
 fresh mushrooms throughout the year, the 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.770
 next variant is the mushrooms too 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.980
 Dry as here the schuster mushroom is 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.500
 awarded pulse when I use the 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:53.140
 drier then he comes to me as 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:58.410
 Stellagen that are window frames the 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:02.490
 are covered and in the dark 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.690
 Dried to dry your ingredients 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.510
 This is also advertised with medicinal plants 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.010
 so tomorrow the sun will hang then the go 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.240
 lost ingredients 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.610
 Do you do that in the dark so ground 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.930
 I guess it will be light 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.020
 then the ingredients stay 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:26.150
 that still to use 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.400
