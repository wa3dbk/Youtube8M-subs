00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
before you go to bed so my strategy was

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.220 
before you go to bed so my strategy was
because<00:05:33.180> what<00:05:33.480> I<00:05:33.510> found<00:05:33.720> was<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.110> was

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
because what I found was that I was

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.710

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.520 
coming home he'd get home like 8:00 in
the<00:05:37.020> morning

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the morning

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.300 
the morning
and<00:05:37.800> then<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:38.790> walk<00:05:39.030> into<00:05:39.360> your<00:05:39.570> kitchen<00:05:39.840> and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
I found that if I started eating then I

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.800 
I found that if I started eating then I
wouldn't<00:05:44.610> stop<00:05:44.880> you<00:05:45.330> know<00:05:45.450> because<00:05:45.660> you're
