some<00:06:36.800> history<00:06:37.400> on<00:06:37.490> it<00:06:38.020> so<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.319> Red<00:06:39.500> Baron<00:06:39.800> was

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
some history on it so the Red Baron was

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.809

during<00:06:41.780> World<00:06:42.110> War<00:06:42.229> one<00:06:42.800> I<00:06:42.830> think<00:06:43.069> or<00:06:43.520> a<00:06:43.550> World

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
during World War one I think or a World

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:44.409 
during World War one I think or a World
War<00:06:44.030> two

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
War two

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.430 
War two
but<00:06:45.259> I<00:06:45.289> think<00:06:45.860> it<00:06:45.979> was<00:06:46.099> World<00:06:46.430> War<00:06:46.610> one<00:06:47.000> maybe

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
but I think it was World War one maybe

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.890 
but I think it was World War one maybe

about<00:07:16.909> the<00:07:17.029> LEGO<00:07:17.240> version<00:07:17.360> of<00:07:18.080> it<00:07:19.270> it<00:07:20.270> shot

00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:20.839 
about the LEGO version of it it shot

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.010 
about the LEGO version of it it shot
down<00:07:20.870> me<00:07:21.379> on<00:07:21.650> Red<00:07:22.610> Baron<00:07:23.060> or<00:07:23.210> the<00:07:23.360> ploidy<00:07:23.599> Baron

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
on so that's why in Charlie Brown that's

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.659 
on so that's why in Charlie Brown that's
why<00:07:27.919> Snoopy<00:07:28.759> is<00:07:29.060> always<00:07:29.479> on<00:07:30.069> ship<00:07:31.069> flying<00:07:31.460> his

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669 
why Snoopy is always on ship flying his

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.629 
why Snoopy is always on ship flying his
plane<00:07:32.029> and<00:07:32.690> shooting<00:07:33.020> down<00:07:33.229> trying<00:07:33.919> to<00:07:33.979> shoot
