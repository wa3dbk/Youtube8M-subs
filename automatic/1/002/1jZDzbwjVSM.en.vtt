00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
hello this is hgr likes to do for and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.400 
hello this is hgr likes to do for and
the<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.290> light<00:00:10.980> paint<00:00:11.220> feature<00:00:11.990> okay<00:00:12.990> light

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the new light paint feature okay light

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.590 
the new light paint feature okay light
paint<00:00:13.680> is<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.010> and<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.850> reflection<00:00:15.240> mode

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
paint is on and it's in reflection mode

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.710 
paint is on and it's in reflection mode
if<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.590> click<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> model<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.520> light<00:00:18.360> source

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
if I click on the model the light source

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.560 
if I click on the model the light source
is<00:00:18.870> selected<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.890> moved<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.820> reflect<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
is selected is moved to reflect in that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.820 
is selected is moved to reflect in that
location<00:00:23.780> so<00:00:24.780> I<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:25.020> duplicate<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.620> light

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
location so I can duplicate this light

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.980 
location so I can duplicate this light
click<00:00:26.760> somewhere<00:00:26.970> else<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.360> model<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
click somewhere else in the model and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.040 
click somewhere else in the model and
now<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> reflects<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.310> location<00:00:30.050> that's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
now it reflects in that location that's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.319 
now it reflects in that location that's
the<00:00:31.230> reflection<00:00:31.470> mode<00:00:32.239> click<00:00:33.239> on

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the reflection mode click on

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.069 
the reflection mode click on
illumination<00:00:33.899> mode<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.710> click<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> model

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
illumination mode and click on the model

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.650 
illumination mode and click on the model
you'll<00:00:37.079> see<00:00:37.289> that<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.920> reflection<00:00:38.660> doesn't

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you'll see that the reflection doesn't

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
you'll see that the reflection doesn't
move<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> position<00:00:40.589> that<00:00:40.829> I've<00:00:40.980> clicked

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
move to the position that I've clicked

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.029 
move to the position that I've clicked
but<00:00:42.059> actually<00:00:42.359> the<00:00:42.510> most<00:00:42.690> light<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.499> received

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
but actually the most light is received

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.270 
but actually the most light is received
by<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.670> position<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.409> we<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.980> when

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
by that position so what we do is when

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
by that position so what we do is when
we<00:00:47.339> click<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.909> illumination<00:00:48.359> mode<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we click with illumination mode the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.099 
we click with illumination mode the
light<00:00:49.949> is<00:00:50.129> positioned<00:00:50.670> normal<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
light is positioned normal to the

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.860 
light is positioned normal to the
surface<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.039> light<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.519> most<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.719> use

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
surface to light it the most when we use

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
surface to light it the most when we use
reflection<00:00:55.469> mode<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.550> actually<00:00:56.850> reflected

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
reflection mode it's actually reflected

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.469 
reflection mode it's actually reflected
through<00:00:57.569> the<00:00:57.719> normal<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.999> say<00:00:59.999> clicking<00:01:00.390> on

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
through the normal and say clicking on

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.969 
through the normal and say clicking on
the<00:01:00.569> edge<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.960> object<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.649> actually

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
the edge of this object would actually

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.700 
the edge of this object would actually
place<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:02.550> light<00:01:02.729> behind<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:04.110> object<00:01:04.500> in

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
place the light behind the object in

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.250 
place the light behind the object in
order<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> reflect<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.690> it<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> very

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
order to reflect there so it is a very

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.319 
order to reflect there so it is a very
different<00:01:07.590> position<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.759> why<00:01:08.939> we

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
different position and that's why we

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.410 
different position and that's why we
provide<00:01:09.509> two<00:01:09.990> ways<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.560> position<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.159> lies

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
provide two ways to position your lies

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
provide two ways to position your lies
in<00:01:12.420> terms<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> reflection<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.649> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
in terms of reflection and the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
in terms of reflection and the
illumination<00:01:14.159> mode<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:15.659> final<00:01:16.049> mode<00:01:16.200> we

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
illumination mode the final mode we

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.039 
illumination mode the final mode we
offer<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.680> rim<00:01:16.950> light<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.719> click<00:01:18.930> on

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
offer is rim light where as you click on

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
offer is rim light where as you click on
the<00:01:19.170> HDR<00:01:19.560> background<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.579> light<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.939> placed

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the HDR background the light is placed

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
the HDR background the light is placed
directly<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> position<00:01:23.399> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> HDR

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
directly on to that position on the HDR

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 
directly on to that position on the HDR
what<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.140> allows<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.649> do<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:26.159> create<00:01:26.490> rim

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what this allows you to do is create rim

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
what this allows you to do is create rim
lighting<00:01:27.060> effect<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.799> put<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.549> HDR<00:01:30.590> light

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
lighting effect so to put that HDR light

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590 
lighting effect so to put that HDR light
on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> HDR<00:01:32.340> directly<00:01:32.850> behind<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.240> object

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
on the HDR directly behind your object

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.920 
on the HDR directly behind your object
so<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.409> were<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.180> want<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.329> rim<00:01:36.509> light<00:01:36.539> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so if you were to want a rim light and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
so if you were to want a rim light and
effect<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> halo<00:01:38.969> around<00:01:39.359> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
effect or to put a halo around the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.779 
effect or to put a halo around the
object<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> by<00:01:41.579> just

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
object then you can do this by just

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.690 
object then you can do this by just
clicking<00:01:41.969> directly<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.289> HDR<00:01:43.710> background

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.510 

ok<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.759> let's<00:01:48.000> clear<00:01:48.210> our<00:01:48.329> lighting<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.520> let's

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
ok so let's clear our lighting and let's

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.240 
ok so let's clear our lighting and let's
use<00:01:50.759> light<00:01:51.030> paint<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.750> reflection<00:01:52.259> mode<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
use light paint in reflection mode to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.810 
use light paint in reflection mode to
place<00:01:53.689> quite<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.719> few<00:01:55.020> light<00:01:55.200> sources<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:56.579> we

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
place quite a few light sources as we

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:10.109 
place quite a few light sources as we
would<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.149> were<00:01:57.270> lighting<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.780> properly

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.119 

okay<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.319> think<00:02:11.410> there's<00:02:11.680> enough<00:02:11.890> lights

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
okay so I think there's enough lights

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.809 
okay so I think there's enough lights
damn<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.849> now<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:14.220> when<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.250> were<00:02:15.459> lighting

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
damn for now and when we were lighting

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.490 
damn for now and when we were lighting
this<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.239> were<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.599> looking<00:02:16.810> at<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.170> object

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
this we were just looking at the object

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.020 
this we were just looking at the object
and<00:02:17.739> puts<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.190> lights<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.700> wanted

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and puts in the lights where we wanted

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.869 
and puts in the lights where we wanted
them<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.290> I've<00:02:20.379> absolutely<00:02:20.560> no<00:02:20.920> idea<00:02:21.519> which

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
them and I've absolutely no idea which

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.000 
them and I've absolutely no idea which
one<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> these<00:02:22.450> light<00:02:22.750> sources<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.440> reflecting

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
one of these light sources is reflecting

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.420 
one of these light sources is reflecting
where<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.610> model<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:26.220> if<00:02:27.220> you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
where on this model so if you

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.330 
where on this model so if you
right-click<00:02:28.349> onto<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.440> model<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:30.250> will

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
right-click onto the model it will

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.520 
right-click onto the model it will
actually<00:02:30.640> find<00:02:31.000> your<00:02:31.299> light<00:02:31.510> using<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.260> same

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
actually find your light using the same

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.280 
actually find your light using the same
light<00:02:33.340> paint<00:02:33.610> mode<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.569> reflection<00:02:35.080> mode

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
light paint mode so in reflection mode

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.930 
light paint mode so in reflection mode
it<00:02:35.650> will<00:02:35.860> find<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.340> light<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.819> is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
it will find the light that is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.690 
it will find the light that is
reflecting<00:02:37.420> there<00:02:37.629> so<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.489> demonstrate

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
reflecting there so just to demonstrate

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.180 
reflecting there so just to demonstrate
this<00:02:40.209> we'll<00:02:40.480> color<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.260> lights<00:02:41.440> as<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.830> select

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
this we'll color the lights as I select

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.479 
this we'll color the lights as I select
them<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.670> will<00:02:42.940> right<00:02:43.209> click<00:02:43.239> here<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.489> wish

your color that's light right click here
right<00:02:51.390> click<00:02:52.390> there<00:02:52.660> now<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.620> case<00:02:53.890> there

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
right click there now in this case there

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.569 
right click there now in this case there
are<00:02:54.160> two<00:02:54.250> lights<00:02:54.730> overlapping<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.890> move

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
are two lights overlapping and as I move

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.850 
are two lights overlapping and as I move
between<00:02:58.269> them<00:02:58.450> they're<00:02:58.840> highlighted<00:02:59.440> with

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
between them they're highlighted with

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.979 
between them they're highlighted with
the<00:02:59.890> crosshair<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.610> canvas<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.720> can

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the crosshair on the canvas so I can

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.520 
the crosshair on the canvas so I can
pick<00:03:02.200> which<00:03:02.440> one<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.890> which<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.349> is<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
pick which one is which so this is a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.130 
pick which one is which so this is a
really<00:03:05.950> useful<00:03:06.160> way<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:07.000> select<00:03:07.360> lights<00:03:07.629> based

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
really useful way to select lights based

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.680 
really useful way to select lights based
on<00:03:08.379> clicking<00:03:08.829> directly<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.459> model

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.660 

and<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.310> final<00:03:17.640> feature<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.710> pan<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:20.040> zoom<00:03:20.100> if

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
and the final feature is pan and zoom if

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.300 
and the final feature is pan and zoom if
we<00:03:21.180> press<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.630> ctrl<00:03:22.140> key<00:03:22.170> or<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> Apple<00:03:23.100> key

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
we press the ctrl key or the Apple key

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.200 
we press the ctrl key or the Apple key
on<00:03:23.880> an<00:03:24.600> Apple<00:03:24.900> Mac<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.550> use<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.730> middle<00:03:27.030> mouse

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
on an Apple Mac and use the middle mouse

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.130 
on an Apple Mac and use the middle mouse
button<00:03:27.240> we<00:03:28.170> can<00:03:28.320> move<00:03:28.530> around<00:03:28.710> our<00:03:29.100> view<00:03:29.400> and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
button we can move around our view and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.800 
button we can move around our view and
use<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.290> right<00:03:31.500> mouse<00:03:31.830> button<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:32.880> zoom<00:03:33.240> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
use the right mouse button to zoom the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.770 
use the right mouse button to zoom the
view<00:03:34.790> we're<00:03:35.790> not<00:03:35.880> actually<00:03:36.090> moving<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
view we're not actually moving the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.680 
view we're not actually moving the
camera<00:03:36.990> we're<00:03:37.950> really<00:03:38.220> moving<00:03:38.580> around<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
camera we're really moving around the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.780 
camera we're really moving around the
film<00:03:39.930> back<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.610> like

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
film back so this is just like

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.150 
film back so this is just like
interacting<00:03:42.570> with<00:03:42.840> an<00:03:42.930> image<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.440> what<00:03:44.070> this

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
interacting with an image and what this

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160 
interacting with an image and what this
means<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:44.880> there's<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.150> very<00:03:45.510> small<00:03:45.660> detail

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
means is if there's a very small detail

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.980 
means is if there's a very small detail
that<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.830> want<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.280> light<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:48.630> use<00:03:48.750> at<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
that I want it to light so use at the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.760 
that I want it to light so use at the
top<00:03:49.200> here<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.430> create<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.700> little<00:03:50.850> light

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
top here and I can create a little light

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.990 
top here and I can create a little light
make<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:52.920> quite<00:03:53.130> bright<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:54.410> just<00:03:55.410> use<00:03:56.000> click

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
make it quite bright and just use click

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.770 
make it quite bright and just use click
on<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.300> edge<00:03:57.510> there<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.080> I've<00:03:59.010> now

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
on that edge there and I've now

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:08.330 
on that edge there and I've now
precisely<00:04:00.780> placed<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.530> high<00:04:01.680> light<00:04:07.190> we<00:04:08.190> can

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
precisely placed a high light we can

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.990 
precisely placed a high light we can
zoom<00:04:08.520> extremely<00:04:09.210> close<00:04:09.450> if<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:09.690> want<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:11.000> and

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
zoom extremely close if we want to and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.340 
zoom extremely close if we want to and
place<00:04:13.520> little<00:04:14.520> highlights

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.370 

as<00:04:19.860> you<00:04:19.980> can<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.750> then<00:04:21.959> zoom<00:04:22.140> ass

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
as you can see that and then zoom ass

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.659 
as you can see that and then zoom ass
again

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.119 

so<00:04:29.389> that's<00:04:29.509> a<00:04:29.569> really<00:04:29.810> nice<00:04:30.050> new<00:04:30.349> feature<00:04:30.620> it's

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
so that's a really nice new feature it's

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.459 
so that's a really nice new feature it's
will<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.310> pan<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.360> zoom<00:04:32.449> around<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.930> shot<00:04:33.139> and

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469 
will to pan and zoom around the shot and

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:37.600 
will to pan and zoom around the shot and
put<00:04:34.460> lights<00:04:34.789> precisely<00:04:35.830> by<00:04:36.830> clicking<00:04:37.340> and

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
put lights precisely by clicking and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.519 
put lights precisely by clicking and
even<00:04:38.060> though<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.300> zoomed<00:04:38.539> in<00:04:38.749> we<00:04:38.960> still<00:04:39.229> can

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
even though you zoomed in we still can
