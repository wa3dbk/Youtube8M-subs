moths only grows near water so I started

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.150 
moths only grows near water so I started
placing<00:01:18.480> it<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.810> near<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> water<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.980> I

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
placing it down near the water and I

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.680 
placing it down near the water and I
noticed<00:01:20.550> something<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.090> noticed<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.660> you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
noticed something I noticed that if you

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.050 
noticed something I noticed that if you
play<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.410> things<00:01:22.979> where<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:23.850> would

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
play some things where they would

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.420 
play some things where they would
naturally<00:01:24.270> occur<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.800> much<00:01:26.100> better

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
naturally occur you get much better

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
naturally occur you get much better
results<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.110> looks<00:01:28.470> more

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
results because it just looks more

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.280 
results because it just looks more
natural<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:30.390> expect<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> be

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
natural you would expect there to be

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.940 
natural you would expect there to be
some<00:01:31.590> sort<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:31.860> grassy<00:01:32.370> over<00:01:32.670> growths<00:01:32.970> near

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
some sort of grassy over growths near

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.249 
some sort of grassy over growths near
near<00:01:34.950> where<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.310> water<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.640> unless<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
near where the water is unless so in the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
near where the water is unless so in the
in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.520> center<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> might<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
in the center there you might have a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.630 
in the center there you might have a
little<00:01:39.660> bit<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> center<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:41.460> or

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
little bit in the center but more or

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.430 
little bit in the center but more or
less<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.150> looks<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.540> lot<00:01:42.690> better<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> place

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
less it looks a lot better if you place

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.109 
less it looks a lot better if you place
it<00:01:43.680> where<00:01:43.979> where<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> would<00:01:44.430> expect<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:44.940> go

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it where where you would expect it to go

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.730 
it where where you would expect it to go
so<00:01:45.300> basically<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.930> point<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.350> really

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
so basically the point of this really

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.410 
so basically the point of this really
short<00:01:46.950> video<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.790> only<00:01:47.940> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.240> about

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
short video it's only going to be about

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
short video it's only going to be about
a<00:01:48.479> minute<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:48.900> two<00:01:49.050> minutes<00:01:49.170> long<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a minute or two minutes long it's just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.040 
a minute or two minutes long it's just
to<00:01:50.369> tell<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.670> guys<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.630> about<00:01:51.750> where

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
to tell you guys think about where

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.680 
to tell you guys think about where
you're<00:01:52.170> placing<00:01:52.440> these<00:01:52.740> objects<00:01:53.220> so

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
you're placing these objects so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.420 
you're placing these objects so
obviously<00:01:54.690> part<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> part<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.130> map

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
obviously part of the part of this map

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.640 
obviously part of the part of this map
is<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.390> four<00:01:57.690> four

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
is going to be that there are four four

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.109 
is going to be that there are four four
pillars<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.190> are<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.520> firing<00:01:59.820> at

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
pillars which are going to be firing at

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.070 
pillars which are going to be firing at
you<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.420> there's<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.720> be<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> boss

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
you and there's going to be a boss

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.510 
you and there's going to be a boss
sitting<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.680> chair<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> top<00:02:02.490> here

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sitting on this chair up in the top here

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
sitting on this chair up in the top here
but<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.690> things<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.020> smaller<00:02:04.470> things<00:02:04.740> like

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
but just things like smaller things like

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
but just things like smaller things like
the<00:02:04.979> grass<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> place<00:02:06.119> where<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> cracks

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the grass and the place where the cracks

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.139 
the grass and the place where the cracks
are<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.409> obviously<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.040> reason<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
are they they obviously have a reason so

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.210 
are they they obviously have a reason so
you'll<00:02:09.750> notice<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.290> weathers<00:02:10.649> these<00:02:10.890> cracks

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you'll notice that weathers these cracks

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.770 
you'll notice that weathers these cracks
here<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.670> created<00:02:11.850> bigger<00:02:12.300> pools<00:02:12.600> of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
here I have created bigger pools of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.290 
here I have created bigger pools of
water<00:02:12.810> more<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:13.830> less<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> way<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
water more or less as a way of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.729 
water more or less as a way of
suggesting<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:16.050> they're<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.590> be

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
suggesting that they're going to be

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.440 
suggesting that they're going to be
leaking<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.550> water<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.239> map

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
leaking that water into the map

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
leaking that water into the map
something<00:02:19.200> else<00:02:19.380> I'm<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.860> add<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.220> some

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
something else I'm going to add is some

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.880 
something else I'm going to add is some
of<00:02:20.580> these<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:20.850> grassy<00:02:21.590> looking<00:02:22.590> herb

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
of these little grassy looking herb

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.229 
of these little grassy looking herb
things<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.549> I'm<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> add<00:02:23.880> those<00:02:24.000> near

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
things and I'm going to add those near

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.970 
things and I'm going to add those near
the<00:02:24.299> water<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.530> pretty<00:02:25.739> shallow

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the water because this is pretty shallow

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800 
the water because this is pretty shallow
water<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.549> you'd<00:02:26.700> sort<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.030> expect<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.600> see

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
water and you'd sort of expect to see

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.300 
water and you'd sort of expect to see
some<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.290> stuff<00:02:28.350> growing<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.190> here

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
some of this stuff growing out of here

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.310 
some of this stuff growing out of here
and<00:02:29.430> maybe<00:02:29.580> even<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.150> moss<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.230> know

and maybe even on this moss you know
some<00:02:31.560> little<00:02:31.650> overgrowth<00:02:32.280> sand<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:33.600> things

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
some little overgrowth sand just things

like that you know it's grown it's grown
out<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
out of the

even some of these detailed things like
these<00:02:42.090> are<00:02:42.290> diamonds<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.530> crystals<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.069> don't

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
these are diamonds and crystals I don't

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.800 
these are diamonds and crystals I don't
know<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.519> are<00:02:44.609> you<00:02:44.879> know<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.209> these

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
know what they are you know like these

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.809 
know what they are you know like these
ores<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.739> where<00:02:46.920> rocks<00:02:47.340> grow

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
ores you know where rocks grow

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.910 
ores you know where rocks grow
you'd<00:02:47.969> think<00:02:48.180> near<00:02:48.510> near<00:02:49.170> water<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.739> might

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
you'd think near near water you might

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.289 
you'd think near near water you might
have<00:02:50.069> some<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.819> know<00:02:50.909> not<00:02:51.090> too<00:02:51.269> many

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
have some of that you know not too many

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.080 
have some of that you know not too many
because<00:02:51.689> it's<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.230> rare<00:02:52.469> resource<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.189> just

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
because it's a rare resource but just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.580 
because it's a rare resource but just
have<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.629> think<00:02:54.930> about<00:02:55.019> where<00:02:55.319> you're<00:02:55.439> placing

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
have a think about where you're placing

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.170 
have a think about where you're placing
these<00:02:55.889> things<00:02:56.159> so<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:56.849> all<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> really

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
these things so that's all I really

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.240 
these things so that's all I really
wanted<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.750> suggest<00:02:57.989> or<00:02:58.469> suggest<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.219> uh

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
wanted to suggest or suggest but uh
