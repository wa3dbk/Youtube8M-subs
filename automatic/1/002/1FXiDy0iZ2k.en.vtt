00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.790
 doing so occurs on our computer 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.990
 note that the

 I was playing as an administrator. 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.380
 now you can perform tasks that 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.590
 you need to perform as the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.840
 administrator without any problem 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.110
 this is a simple video but that many 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.540
 people do not know how to 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.519
 disable is the same process you go 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.989
 do the reverse only 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:53.720

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.880
 disabled 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.579
 so this is it, it's a video 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.680
 simple but many people have got 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.010

 I'm sorry for the audio and it must be 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.350
 external noise that may be coming in 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.030
 video 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.030
