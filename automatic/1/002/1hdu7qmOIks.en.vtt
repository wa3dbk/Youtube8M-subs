this is gonna be a quick tutorial on

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.749 
this is gonna be a quick tutorial on
modeling<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.120> mesh<00:00:03.389> using<00:00:03.720> Bezier<00:00:04.230> curves

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
modeling a mesh using Bezier curves

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.940 
modeling a mesh using Bezier curves
you're<00:00:05.759> basically<00:00:06.240> gonna<00:00:06.390> draw<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.680> using

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950

slider on this if you turn it down

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
slider on this if you turn it down
you're<00:00:53.820> gonna<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> more<00:00:54.629> opaque<00:00:54.870> image<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you're gonna get a more opaque image you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
you're gonna get a more opaque image you
turn<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.300> more

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
turn it up it's gonna be more

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
turn it up it's gonna be more
transparent<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> about<00:00:59.670> 85

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
transparent so I'm gonna put it about 85

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
transparent so I'm gonna put it about 85
percent<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.870> barely<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.940> know

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
percent so it's barely there you know

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.219 
percent so it's barely there you know
bear<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.359> me<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.719> doing<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> these

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
bear with me on doing some of these

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.050 
bear with me on doing some of these
curves<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:05.040> when<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.460> recording<00:01:05.610> I'm

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
curves because when I'm recording I'm

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660 
curves because when I'm recording I'm
usually<00:01:06.210> using<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:07.159> smaller<00:01:08.159> blender

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
usually using a lot smaller blender

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
usually using a lot smaller blender
screen<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> resolution<00:01:09.720> than<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.930> usually<00:01:10.110> do

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
screen and resolution than I usually do

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.780 
screen and resolution than I usually do
so<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> pain<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> butt<00:01:11.760> for

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
so it's kind of a pain in the butt for

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.359 
so it's kind of a pain in the butt for
me<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.170> add<00:01:14.390> curve<00:01:15.830> easier<00:01:16.830> curve<00:01:19.369> if

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
me I'm gonna add curve easier curve if

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.219 
me I'm gonna add curve easier curve if
we<00:01:20.549> zoom<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.420> where<00:01:21.630> our<00:01:21.659> curve<00:01:21.930> looks

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
we zoom in that's where our curve looks

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
we zoom in that's where our curve looks
like<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> edit<00:01:23.970> mode<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.420> you'll

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
like I'm going to edit mode and you'll

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.060 
like I'm going to edit mode and you'll
notice<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.619> there's<00:01:25.830> these<00:01:25.950> little

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
notice that there's these little

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
notice that there's these little
handlebars<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.380> move<00:01:28.500> your

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
handlebars on it now you can move your

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
handlebars on it now you can move your
curve<00:01:28.950> by<00:01:29.610> selecting<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> middle<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
curve by selecting the middle like this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.780 
curve by selecting the middle like this
and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> actually<00:01:32.250> change<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and you have to actually change the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
and you have to actually change the
angle<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.180> curve<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:34.009> grabbed<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
angle of your curve I grabbed it on the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.910 
angle of your curve I grabbed it on the
handlebars<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.790> using<00:01:36.060> them<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.270> sliders<00:01:36.920> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
handlebars and using them as sliders so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.789 
handlebars and using them as sliders so
we're<00:01:38.820> gonna<00:01:38.939> start<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.450> by<00:01:39.659> taking<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.170> curve

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.590 

bringing<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.850> down<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.520> bottom<00:01:48.969> where<00:01:49.539> I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600

want<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.899> start<00:01:50.140> my<00:01:50.320> point<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.890> could

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
want to start my point you could

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.319 
want to start my point you could
actually<00:01:51.189> like<00:01:51.549> hold<00:01:51.820> G<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.149> your<00:01:52.179> keyboard

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329

I'm gonna change this a little bit by

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
I'm gonna change this a little bit by
clicking<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.579> my<00:02:27.670> handlebars<00:02:28.799> bringing<00:02:29.799> it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
clicking on my handlebars bringing it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.050 
clicking on my handlebars bringing it
down<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:32.440> you're<00:02:33.280> wondering<00:02:33.579> why<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.670> started

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
down if you're wondering why I started

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.819 
down if you're wondering why I started
so<00:02:34.269> far<00:02:34.480> up<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.780> glass<00:02:35.079> right<00:02:35.380> here<00:02:35.440> when<00:02:35.739> I

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
so far up on the glass right here when I

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.250 
so far up on the glass right here when I
started<00:02:36.090> basically<00:02:37.090> most<00:02:37.450> wine<00:02:37.720> glasses<00:02:37.959> have

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
started basically most wine glasses have

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.860 
started basically most wine glasses have
an<00:02:38.380> indent<00:02:38.799> on<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.099> bottom<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.970> that's<00:02:40.569> gonna

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
an indent on the bottom so that's gonna

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.610 
an indent on the bottom so that's gonna
create<00:02:41.140> our<00:02:41.200> indent<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:44.260> we're<00:02:44.379> gonna<00:02:44.500> hit

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
create our indent now we're gonna hit

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:54.059 
create our indent now we're gonna hit
control<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:46.440> create<00:02:47.440> another<00:02:47.950> curve<00:02:53.069> just

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
control and create another curve just

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.030 
control and create another curve just
kind<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.459> manipulate<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.180> place<00:02:55.769> using<00:02:56.769> our

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
kind of manipulate it in place using our

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.259 
kind of manipulate it in place using our
handlebars<00:02:59.160> then<00:03:00.160> make<00:03:00.430> control<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.000> create

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
handlebars then make control and create

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.629 
handlebars then make control and create
another<00:03:01.799> you're<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:02.950> going<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.400> all

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
another you're just going to do this all

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.220 
another you're just going to do this all
the<00:03:03.700> way<00:03:03.910> through<00:03:03.940> while<00:03:04.389> you're<00:03:04.569> tracing<00:03:05.109> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
the way through while you're tracing the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:19.920 
the way through while you're tracing the
outline<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.829> your<00:03:05.889> shape

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.780 

now<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.890> not<00:03:22.070> going<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.280> be<00:03:22.340> enough<00:03:22.490> to<00:03:22.610> go<00:03:22.700> up

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
now it's not going to be enough to go up

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.550 
now it's not going to be enough to go up
to<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.000> top<00:03:23.240> the<00:03:23.660> glass<00:03:23.780> has<00:03:24.140> some<00:03:24.320> thickness

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
to the top the glass has some thickness

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.110 
to the top the glass has some thickness
here<00:03:24.890> we're<00:03:25.130> making<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.520> 3d<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.030> you're

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
here we're making this 3d so you're

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.730 
here we're making this 3d so you're
gonna<00:03:26.210> have<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.420> bring<00:03:26.600> another<00:03:26.810> line<00:03:27.080> all<00:03:27.350> the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
gonna have to bring another line all the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.510 
gonna have to bring another line all the
way<00:03:27.770> back<00:03:28.040> down<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.490> center<00:03:28.700> here<00:03:29.200> so

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
way back down to the center here so

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.110 
way back down to the center here so
create<00:03:31.520> another<00:03:31.820> curve<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:34.610> one<00:03:34.820> I<00:03:34.880> can

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
create another curve this one I can

00:03:35.120 --> 00:04:07.290 
create another curve this one I can
actually<00:03:35.150> probably<00:03:35.840> stretch<00:03:36.140> quite<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> ways

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
y-axis here on my centers where I

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.370 
y-axis here on my centers where I
started<00:04:11.830> and<00:04:12.370> where<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.640> finished<00:04:13.170> I'm<00:04:14.170> gonna

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.530 
do is you're gonna want to make sure
that<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.890> place<00:04:48.790> this<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> y-axis

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
that you place this on the y-axis

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.240 
that you place this on the y-axis
because<00:04:50.380> that's<00:04:50.680> where<00:04:50.860> you're<00:04:50.950> gonna<00:04:51.010> want

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
because that's where you're gonna want

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.270 
because that's where you're gonna want
to<00:04:51.310> spin<00:04:51.580> around<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.660> notice<00:04:53.170> I<00:04:53.320> click<00:04:54.040> and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
to spin around so you notice I click and

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.000 
to spin around so you notice I click and
it's<00:04:54.400> changing<00:04:55.210> my<00:04:55.300> point<00:04:55.630> here<00:04:55.930> I'm<00:04:56.800> gonna

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
it's changing my point here I'm gonna

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.920 
it's changing my point here I'm gonna
want<00:04:57.190> to<00:04:57.250> click<00:04:57.460> from<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.150> top<00:04:58.450> view<00:04:58.480> right

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
want to click from the top view right

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.670 
want to click from the top view right
here<00:04:59.340> so<00:05:00.340> I'm<00:05:00.400> gonna<00:05:00.520> go<00:05:00.700> up

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
here so I'm gonna go up

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:19.620 
here so I'm gonna go up
and<00:05:02.700> maybe<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:03.760> little<00:05:04.000> bit<00:05:04.210> outside

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.570 

it's<00:05:20.630> just<00:05:20.840> not<00:05:20.990> what<00:05:21.200> in<00:05:21.320> place<00:05:21.560> right<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:22.010> it

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.830 

that's<00:05:25.580> okay<00:05:25.970> because<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.570> can<00:05:26.690> also

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
that's okay because you can also

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.720 
that's okay because you can also
manipulate<00:05:27.140> where<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:28.010> at<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:28.490> I'm<00:05:28.610> gonna

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
manipulate where this is at so I'm gonna

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.550 
manipulate where this is at so I'm gonna
manipulate<00:05:28.940> this<00:05:29.330> over<00:05:29.630> a<00:05:29.660> little<00:05:29.810> bit<00:05:29.990> make

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
manipulate this over a little bit make

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.450 
manipulate this over a little bit make
it<00:05:30.590> line<00:05:30.830> up<00:05:30.860> at<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.130> center<00:05:33.100> I'm<00:05:34.100> just<00:05:34.370> gonna

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
it line up at the center I'm just gonna

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.400 
it line up at the center I'm just gonna
close<00:05:34.700> out<00:05:34.910> my<00:05:34.940> back<00:05:35.240> image<00:05:35.570> background<00:05:36.230> image

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
close out my back image background image

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.160 
close out my back image background image
for<00:05:36.440> now<00:05:36.710> cuz<00:05:36.890> I<00:05:36.920> don't<00:05:36.980> need<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:38.080> then<00:05:39.080> I'm

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
for now cuz I don't need it then I'm

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.020 
for now cuz I don't need it then I'm
gonna<00:05:39.260> go<00:05:39.410> back<00:05:39.440> into<00:05:39.920> edit<00:05:40.100> mode<00:05:42.790> then<00:05:43.790> down

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
gonna go back into edit mode then down

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.930 
gonna go back into edit mode then down
here<00:05:44.330> we<00:05:44.420> have<00:05:44.570> our<00:05:44.690> spin<00:05:45.050> options<00:05:45.940> degrees

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
here we have our spin options degrees

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.060 
here we have our spin options degrees
I'm<00:05:47.390> gonna<00:05:47.540> want<00:05:47.750> to<00:05:47.810> make<00:05:47.930> this<00:05:48.080> go<00:05:48.320> 360

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
I'm gonna want to make this go 360

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.640 
I'm gonna want to make this go 360
degrees<00:05:49.340> all<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.580> way<00:05:49.670> around<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.470> steps<00:05:51.470> you

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
degrees all the way around and steps you

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.030 
degrees all the way around and steps you
can<00:05:51.770> think<00:05:52.040> of<00:05:52.190> more<00:05:52.670> like<00:05:54.040> different

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
can think of more like different

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.230 
can think of more like different
segments<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.700> are<00:05:55.790> gonna<00:05:55.880> go<00:05:56.030> all<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.210> way

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
segments that are gonna go all the way

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.960 
segments that are gonna go all the way
around<00:05:56.390> someone<00:05:56.840> want<00:05:57.020> 21<00:05:57.470> segments<00:05:58.040> our

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
around someone want 21 segments our

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.620 
around someone want 21 segments our
steps<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:01.610> basically<00:06:02.030> from<00:06:02.210> here<00:06:02.300> you're

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
steps and basically from here you're

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.090 
steps and basically from here you're
just<00:06:02.660> gonna<00:06:02.960> hit<00:06:03.140> spin<00:06:03.680> oh<00:06:05.200> no<00:06:06.200> valid<00:06:06.620> vertices

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
just gonna hit spin oh no valid vertices

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.140 
just gonna hit spin oh no valid vertices
are<00:06:07.250> selected<00:06:08.860> see<00:06:09.860> they're<00:06:09.980> all<00:06:10.100> purple<00:06:10.460> so

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
are selected see they're all purple so

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.580 
are selected see they're all purple so
you<00:06:11.240> can<00:06:11.330> either<00:06:11.450> like<00:06:11.870> I<00:06:11.960> said<00:06:12.140> earlier<00:06:12.410> go

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
you can either like I said earlier go

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.710 
you can either like I said earlier go
here<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:12.920> select<00:06:13.280> or<00:06:13.550> deselect<00:06:13.670> all<00:06:14.180> or<00:06:14.420> I'm

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
here and select or deselect all or I'm

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.050 
here and select or deselect all or I'm
just<00:06:14.780> gonna<00:06:15.020> use<00:06:15.200> hotkey<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.760> now<00:06:16.760> they're<00:06:16.940> all

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
just gonna use hotkey a now they're all

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.350 
just gonna use hotkey a now they're all
yellow<00:06:18.010> go<00:06:19.010> back<00:06:19.220> up<00:06:19.460> you<00:06:19.970> ever<00:06:20.090> want<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.270> make

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
yellow go back up you ever want to make

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.760 
yellow go back up you ever want to make
sure<00:06:20.420> you<00:06:20.660> do<00:06:20.810> this<00:06:20.900> from<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.110> top<00:06:21.350> view<00:06:21.410> cuz

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
sure you do this from the top view cuz

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.230 
sure you do this from the top view cuz
it's<00:06:21.890> gonna<00:06:21.950> spin<00:06:22.280> around<00:06:22.400> from<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.000> top<00:06:23.210> view

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
it's gonna spin around from the top view

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.460 
it's gonna spin around from the top view
if<00:06:23.540> you<00:06:23.630> did<00:06:23.780> this<00:06:23.900> from<00:06:24.020> the<00:06:24.080> side<00:06:24.320> you're

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
if you did this from the side you're

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.260 
if you did this from the side you're
gonna<00:06:24.530> end<00:06:24.740> up<00:06:24.770> with<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:25.010> big<00:06:25.190> circle<00:06:25.640> so<00:06:26.150> now

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
gonna end up with the big circle so now

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.250 
gonna end up with the big circle so now
we're<00:06:26.480> on<00:06:26.540> top<00:06:26.720> you<00:06:26.930> hit<00:06:27.440> spin<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:30.050> can

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
we're on top you hit spin and I can

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.290 
we're on top you hit spin and I can
rotate<00:06:30.470> my<00:06:30.650> camera<00:06:31.070> back<00:06:31.220> down<00:06:33.220> and<00:06:34.220> we<00:06:35.060> have<00:06:35.270> a

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
rotate my camera back down and we have a

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.340 
rotate my camera back down and we have a
sagal<00:06:35.720> it<00:06:36.970> let's<00:06:37.970> go<00:06:38.150> back<00:06:38.360> to<00:06:38.540> object<00:06:38.690> mode<00:06:39.020> so

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
sagal it let's go back to object mode so

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.000 
sagal it let's go back to object mode so
you<00:06:39.410> can<00:06:39.560> see<00:06:39.740> this<00:06:39.800> a<00:06:39.950> little<00:06:40.010> better<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:42.010> you

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
you can see this a little better and you

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.070 
you can see this a little better and you
have<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.490> mesh<00:06:43.760> wine<00:06:44.060> glass<00:06:44.390> goblet<00:06:44.690> or
