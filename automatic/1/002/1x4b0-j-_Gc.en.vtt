00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
inside this toy box once because we want

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:03.750 
inside this toy box once because we want
to<00:01:02.440> see<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.680> start<00:01:02.979> scheme<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.400> gonna<00:01:03.549> start

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
to see a start scheme is gonna start

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.109 
to see a start scheme is gonna start
outside<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.710> second<00:01:06.040> player<00:01:06.159> spawns<00:01:06.549> outside

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
outside the second player spawns outside

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.120 
outside the second player spawns outside
of<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.299> coliseum<00:01:07.960> area<00:01:08.290> where<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.619> fight<00:01:08.890> at

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
of the coliseum area where you fight at

so<00:01:09.820> he's<00:01:10.060> gonna<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.510> put<00:01:10.750> on<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.869> boost

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
so he's gonna have to put on a boost

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.590 
so he's gonna have to put on a boost
pack<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.680> he<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.890> come<00:01:12.040> inside<00:01:12.330> I'll<00:01:13.330> be<00:01:13.540> able

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600
