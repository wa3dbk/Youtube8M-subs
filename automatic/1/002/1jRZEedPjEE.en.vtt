00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 nowadays the equipment is 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.720
 smart smarts become smart 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.760
 We have already tested the smart tv here 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.740
 samsung and now it's the turn of the people 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.099
 test the competitor of lg in this market 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.789
 There is 3d cinema smart tv is available at 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.859
 two sizes 55 inches or 47 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.070
 that this is where we are. 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 testing it has full HD resolution with 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.769
 update rate of 240 hertz and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.750
 Dynamic Contrast 9 million for the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.940
 which guarantees incredible images 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.700
 the speakers are in the back 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.760
 and produces a powerful sound but without many 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.920
 as well as in the competitor one of the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 points that deserve to be highlighted is the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.820
 to lg and says that it has smaller edge 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.719
 front of the market with less than one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.180
 millimeter 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.430
 looking like this with the tv off looks like 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.649
 even when we turn on the screen we see 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 inside we have another border there 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 not in mg 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 the base is another point that deceives despite 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 to be beautiful is made of plastic but not 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 The TV has a nice finish and a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.900
 stylish design and gives you the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 side angle of the base here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
 who has a lot of equipment to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 connect on tv there is 3d cinema of lg no 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.930
 it will be a problem 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.409
 she owns four 3-usb gyms and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.689
 ethernet network entry wi fi built-in 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.540
 vga input video composite video 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.640
 audio output component p2 for handset and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.979
 the optical audio output jack 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.659
 antennas for cable tv which is not very 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.390
 used here because most of the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.040
 operators use decoders 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.110
 through the usb input it is possible 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.049
 play multiple photo files 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.790
 audio and video including subtitles and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 you can also use the time 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.770
 machine to record the program but it is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 I need to use a hd of at least 40 gigs 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.590
 for that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 0 0 is very good with good level of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.340
 depth 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.500
 You will not be able to see the 3d there. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.049
 works well the glasses are light and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.930
 comfortable because TV uses technology 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.320
 passive battery without the use of 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.969
 good 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.119
 these are resources that most 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.759
 new tvs have and 3d smart tv cinema 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.190
 smart features 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.230
 with it you can browse the internet and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.400
 use multiple apps 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.500
 facebook youtube twitter and netflix 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.909
 application store has up to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.819
 day of our recording 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.769
 about 400 items the menus are full 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.519
 options both simple to 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.640
 to move 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.069
 Incidentally, your samsung smart tv uses a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.110
 technology similar to kinect for 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.840
 speech recognition and gestures 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.780
 lg smart tv uses a similar feature 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.480
 with control of wii and cimed remote 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.590
 here is just pointing to tv that appears a 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.629
 right on the screen 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.480
 here is a mouse-like scroll 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.120
 directional arrows and simple control gives 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.950
 even to compare the samsung tv was 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 I need to make the gestures by hand. 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.959
 here we control points and has a 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.670
 more sensitive but I will not say 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.980
 Which is better because it goes from every 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.569
 The user both works very well. 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.099
 other available function that the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.379
 voice recognition 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.260
 if on samsung tv you had some 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.269
 commands pre-defined here on tv from LG 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.359
 You can say the command you want. 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.480
 films and tv will try to understand 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.940
 sometimes she's right sometimes not on TV 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.609
 samsung the microphone was on the tv itself 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.280
 and here in lg the microphone is in mexico 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.169
 and road and for those who will use the smart tv 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.019
 to play videogame 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.060
 she has a really cool resource dow play 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.329
 knows that racing game that divides the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.769
 screen with these glasses here each 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.370
 player will see your car on screen 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.430
 full 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.950
 But how can this be simple? 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.049
 using the same principle of 3d in the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.819
 3d glasses and conventional 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.440
 we have two images superimposed on 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.419
 different frequencies 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.880
 each lens of the glasses see one of the 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.849
 frequencies and there we have the feeling of 3d 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.370
 play with the use of television screen grabs 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.739
 split of the games stretches to the screen 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.000
 whole and superimposes the images of man 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.829
 each frequency 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.180
 only that the glasses have two lenses 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.700
 repeated 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.069
 so each user only sees one image 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.620
 on the screen a pair of glasses will only see the 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.970
 images from player 11 and another only 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.609
 bathroom pictures 2 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.880
 cool this is just like in most 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.039
 smart appliances cinema 3d smart tv's 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.830
 lg have functions and applications 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.610
 incredible that will change the way you 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.430
 we interact 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.319
 the TV only that it is clear all these functions 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.240

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.039
