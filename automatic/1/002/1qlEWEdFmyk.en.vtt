00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.110
 true is the premium version and I know 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.240
 I will leave totally free in the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.430
 description of the good video friends we are going 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.170
 to start with the emulator and we're going to 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.180
 begin to configure it for this 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 great game that has not happened to me 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.470
 fashion is metal slug 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.790
 until the interface of this emulator and what 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.220
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.620
 direct us to the adjustments once the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.320
 adjustments we are going to go to system the 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.600
 system we are going to direct to language and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.480
 we are going to change it to spanish espaÃ±a ' 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.120
 well let's give back and now as 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.550
 we can put what is the game 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.830
 then we will go to games and 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.320
 here we have to search and here we 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.590
 emulates what is the memory of our 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.910
 phone in my case like I have the motorcycle x 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.160
 I'm just cool what a 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.020
 memory you have to download the 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.030
 game will be downloaded to them in point 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.910
 real and they have to decompress it for 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.190
 that they have a point file made a 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.800
 once they have the iso point of metal 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.570
 good slug create a folder in my case 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.780
 I created it here where it says feet 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.830
 for where it says game metal slug and good 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.290
 there is the game what 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.910
 we select and it will start but before 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 to start what is the game we have 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.979
 that set the pp so that we can 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.290
 correctly the game we are going to go 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.360
 new what are the adjustments first that 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.720
 nothing shows us what is graphics here 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.840
 in graphics 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.180
 what is the screen and you will me 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.800
 go configuring each step is worth it because if 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.080
 we see each one we are going to take 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.720
 very much then you pause in what 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 what is the video and go putting it as 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.120
 I have it then we are going to lower it a little 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.120
 to little 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 and now we are going to move to sound 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.420
 then we're going to go to controls 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.600
 and finally we're going to go to the system 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.400
 good friends once configured already 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.860
 all the parameters of this emulator 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.840
 we are going to give back and now we are going to 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.820
 be able to run the game correctly 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.190
 let's start what is metal slug 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.780
 we're going to click on it and well we're going 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.150
 to start loading everything correctly 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.960
 here we are going to click on what is the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.030
 side button with the circle one's worth and 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.190
 let's wait for him to load what 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.190
 is this game will start this way 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.390
 will thus start the game and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.100
 we have to give to who they are once 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.960
 Who to be with, let's move the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.570
 parameters here this occasion we have to 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.360
 put the mind mission and we're going to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.550
 select with x once in x then 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.280
 we have to press again x let's 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.980
 choose the normal mode we will choose 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.680
 our character is worth it and we are going to give him 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.290
 in x once in x let's click on the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.320
 vision 1 and ready will start what is the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.080
 game if they did not set up and this one as 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.070
 I have it, it's going to run 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.130
 which is the game so it's very 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.890
 important 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.500
 wiggle the settings as I did in the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.380
 video so we're left with the game 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.890
 come on let's play it a little bit to 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.960

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.640
 here they have already killed me I do not achieve 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.630

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.910
 ram memory your phone so that 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.550
