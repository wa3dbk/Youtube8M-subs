00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
faces so I knew there are already some

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
faces so I knew there are already some
shenanigans<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.830> downloading

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
shenanigans going on with downloading

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
shenanigans going on with downloading
these<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.729> other<00:01:17.909> characters<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.570> trying<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
these for other characters and trying to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
these for other characters and trying to
get<00:01:18.960> non-meat<00:01:19.619> characters<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> inherit<00:01:20.640> their

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
get non-meat characters to inherit their

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
get non-meat characters to inherit their
traits<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> thought<00:01:21.930> I'd<00:01:22.020> try<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.229> from

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
traits so I thought I'd try this from

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.310 
traits so I thought I'd try this from
you<00:01:22.650> -<00:01:22.890> because<00:01:23.369> he's<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> character<00:01:24.869> who's<00:01:25.020> not

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you - because he's a character who's not

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.100 
you - because he's a character who's not
supposed<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.189> any<00:01:26.369> custom<00:01:26.759> moves<00:01:26.970> yet<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
supposed to have any custom moves yet so

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
supposed to have any custom moves yet so
what<00:01:28.320> happens<00:01:28.740> when<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.130> give<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> character

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
what happens when you give a character

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.340 
what happens when you give a character
that's<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.090> supposed<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.750> custom<00:01:31.140> moves

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that's not supposed to have custom moves

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.560 
that's not supposed to have custom moves
custom<00:01:32.070> moves<00:01:32.280> by<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.700> inheriting<00:01:33.360> glitch

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
custom moves by this inheriting glitch

it<00:04:09.840> kind<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.050> shakes<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.530> little<00:04:10.620> bit<00:04:10.890> and

sometimes he's able to actually form the
ball<00:04:13.830> but<00:04:14.040> he<00:04:14.070> crashes<00:04:14.340> when<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.700> ball<00:04:14.880> is

one<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.560> your<00:04:40.740> moves

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
one of your moves

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.610 
one of your moves
it's<00:04:42.000> really<00:04:42.210> weird<00:04:42.389> that's<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:42.720> only<00:04:43.050> custom

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
it's really weird that's the only custom

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.540 
it's really weird that's the only custom
move<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:43.949> found<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.310> did<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:47.430> next

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
move that I found that did that the next

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.980 
move that I found that did that the next
meet<00:04:47.849> with<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.030> custom<00:04:48.300> move<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.509> downloaded

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
meet with the custom move I downloaded

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.559 
meet with the custom move I downloaded
changed<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.590> down<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:50.190> special<00:04:50.789> to<00:04:51.300> this

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
changed the down be special to this

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.719 
changed the down be special to this
zoomin<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.470> dim<00:04:52.800> thing<00:04:53.129> which<00:04:53.430> looks<00:04:53.669> like

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
zoomin and dim thing which looks like

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.369 
zoomin and dim thing which looks like
the<00:04:53.909> start<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.300> final<00:04:54.569> smash<00:04:54.810> animation

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
the start of the final smash animation

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.200 
the start of the final smash animation
but<00:04:55.590> without<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.250> actual<00:04:56.490> transformation

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
but without the actual transformation

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.330 
but without the actual transformation
you<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:57.870> keep<00:04:58.050> spamming<00:04:58.259> this<00:04:58.530> over<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.099> over

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
you can keep spamming this over and over

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.830 
you can keep spamming this over and over
again<00:04:59.460> so<00:04:59.789> it<00:05:00.000> looks<00:05:00.120> like<00:05:00.270> he<00:05:00.389> is<00:05:00.479> dancing

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
again so it looks like he is dancing

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.230 
again so it looks like he is dancing
like<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:01.020> little<00:05:01.229> ballerina

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
like a little ballerina

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.760 
like a little ballerina
it<00:05:03.240> wasn't<00:05:03.569> until<00:05:03.719> I<00:05:03.810> downloaded<00:05:04.110> me<00:05:04.379> that<00:05:04.590> had

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
it wasn't until I downloaded me that had

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.529 
it wasn't until I downloaded me that had
the<00:05:04.979> move<00:05:05.190> chakram<00:05:05.789> that<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:05.969> learned<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.419> I

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
the move chakram that I learned that I

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.390 
the move chakram that I learned that I
could<00:05:06.569> drag<00:05:07.229> my<00:05:07.469> opponent<00:05:08.039> on<00:05:08.219> the<00:05:08.250> ground

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
could drag my opponent on the ground

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.600 
could drag my opponent on the ground
underneath<00:05:09.150> me<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.860> kind<00:05:11.069> of<00:05:11.129> glitched<00:05:11.400> them

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
underneath me it kind of glitched them

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.070 
underneath me it kind of glitched them
out<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:11.849> made<00:05:12.030> them<00:05:12.210> just<00:05:12.330> attach<00:05:12.629> the<00:05:12.900> bottom

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
out and made them just attach the bottom

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.469 
out and made them just attach the bottom
of<00:05:13.319> your<00:05:13.620> character<00:05:14.159> I<00:05:14.430> did<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:15.120> using<00:05:15.389> the

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
of your character I did this using the

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.409 
of your character I did this using the
side<00:05:15.690> special<00:05:16.229> aka<00:05:16.469> side<00:05:17.219> beat<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:18.270> is

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
side special aka side beat this is

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.520 
side special aka side beat this is
probably<00:05:18.659> one<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.870> most<00:05:19.020> fun<00:05:19.289> things

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
probably one of the most fun things

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.659 
probably one of the most fun things
because<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:19.979> can<00:05:20.099> just<00:05:20.190> drag<00:05:20.460> your<00:05:20.610> opponent

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
because you can just drag your opponent

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.550 
because you can just drag your opponent
all<00:05:21.090> over<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.389> screen<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.990> they<00:05:22.169> can't<00:05:22.349> break

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
all over the screen and they can't break

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.709 
all over the screen and they can't break
free<00:05:22.590> until<00:05:23.009> you<00:05:23.069> hit<00:05:23.340> them<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.759> noticed<00:05:24.629> that

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
free until you hit them I noticed that

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:25.879 
free until you hit them I noticed that
when<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:24.840> go<00:05:25.050> off<00:05:25.139> to<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.289> side<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.680> stage

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
when you go off to the side of the stage

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.740 
when you go off to the side of the stage
and<00:05:25.919> you<00:05:26.159> try<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.550> jump<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:27.090> uses<00:05:27.629> the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
and you try and jump it uses the

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.600 
and you try and jump it uses the
location<00:05:28.379> of<00:05:28.469> where<00:05:28.680> they<00:05:29.009> are<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.430> you're

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
location of where they are as you're

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.040 
location of where they are as you're
jumping<00:05:29.849> points<00:05:30.330> so<00:05:30.479> kind<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.750> lead<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.960> this

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
jumping points so kind of lead to this

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.480 
jumping points so kind of lead to this
we're<00:05:31.349> disjointed<00:05:31.860> effect<00:05:32.219> when<00:05:32.370> you're

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
we're disjointed effect when you're

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.950 
we're disjointed effect when you're
trying<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.699> jump<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.300> you're<00:05:33.509> on<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.750> side<00:05:33.930> of

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
trying to jump and you're on the side of

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.899 
trying to jump and you're on the side of
the<00:05:34.110> stage<00:05:34.380> with<00:05:34.680> somebody<00:05:34.919> below<00:05:35.159> you<00:05:35.219> since

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
the stage with somebody below you since

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.610 
the stage with somebody below you since
this<00:05:36.029> was<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> coolest<00:05:36.509> one<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:37.050> decided<00:05:37.409> to

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
this was the coolest one I decided to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.719 
this was the coolest one I decided to
see<00:05:37.740> if<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:37.889> could<00:05:38.039> combine<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.460> with<00:05:38.490> something

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
see if I could combine it with something

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.610 
see if I could combine it with something
else<00:05:38.940> so<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.330> combined<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.110> one<00:05:40.380> with<00:05:40.560> the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
else so I combined that one with the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.159 
else so I combined that one with the
ballerina<00:05:41.190> dance<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.699> it<00:05:42.060> led<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.300> this<00:05:42.750> weird

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
ballerina dance and it led to this weird

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.600 
ballerina dance and it led to this weird
thing<00:05:43.469> where<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.740> could<00:05:43.889> endlessly<00:05:44.310> break

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
thing where I could endlessly break

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.670 
thing where I could endlessly break
dance<00:05:44.849> on<00:05:44.969> someone's<00:05:45.270> face<00:05:45.449> while<00:05:46.440> I<00:05:46.469> was

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
dance on someone's face while I was

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.050 
dance on someone's face while I was
doing<00:05:46.919> this<00:05:47.039> I<00:05:47.190> also<00:05:47.310> found<00:05:47.610> out<00:05:47.699> that<00:05:47.759> I<00:05:47.909> could

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
doing this I also found out that I could

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.749 
doing this I also found out that I could
spam<00:05:48.419> side<00:05:48.779> B<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.289> yo-yo<00:05:49.560> him<00:05:49.979> between<00:05:50.310> being
