 Hi, I 'm middle 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.410
 I just got here. I have no idea 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.650
 What's happening 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.960
 none of my friends and masters 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.480
 builders including but not limited to 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.150
 the superman wonder woman would not even 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.190
 from the space of 1980 something 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.739

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.479
 basketball stars of 2002 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.250

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.579
 plan to end the world that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.059
 we know but there is still hope 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.489
 special has arisen 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.440
 I think I understood but it would 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.620
 To say it all again, I was 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.620
 listening 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 Calm down, I'm the band here. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 It's incredible to make one of them orange 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.189
 I only work full time and sometimes 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.189
 very very dark consciousness 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.850
 then the colleague I did not want to talk but I think 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.310
 You should not be here. 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.310
