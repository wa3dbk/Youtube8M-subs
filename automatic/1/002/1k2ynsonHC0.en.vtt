00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
if you go to that place on the map there

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.659 
if you go to that place on the map there
will<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.050> monster<00:04:44.590> or<00:04:44.620> multiple<00:04:45.190> monsters

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
where you can kill them once you do that

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.680 
where you can kill them once you do that
you'll<00:04:49.540> get<00:04:49.840> an<00:04:50.830> amount<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.390> money<00:04:52.390> and

experience equal to the amount of

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.320 
experience equal to the amount of
participation<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.110> held<00:04:56.350> in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.860> fight

participation that you held in the fight

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.909 
participation that you held in the fight
now<00:04:58.330> this<00:04:58.510> can<00:04:58.750> be<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> very<00:04:59.050> quick<00:04:59.710> way<00:04:59.890> to

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
now this can be a very quick way to

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.640 
now this can be a very quick way to
level<00:05:00.340> up<00:05:00.550> in<00:05:01.120> fact<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.750> think<00:05:01.990> as<00:05:02.140> of<00:05:02.380> right<00:05:02.620> now

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
level up in fact I think as of right now

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.159 
level up in fact I think as of right now
it<00:05:03.040> is<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> fastest<00:05:03.790> way<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:03.970> level<00:05:04.210> up<00:05:04.450> if<00:05:04.660> you

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
it is the fastest way to level up if you

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.010 
it is the fastest way to level up if you
continue<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.919> do<00:05:06.100> fates<00:05:06.880> over<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:07.570> over<00:05:07.720> again

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
continue to do fates over and over again

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.170 
continue to do fates over and over again
although<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.830> wouldn't<00:05:09.130> suggest<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.820> because

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
although I wouldn't suggest this because

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.880 
although I wouldn't suggest this because
it<00:05:10.390> can<00:05:10.630> become<00:05:10.840> mind-numbingly<00:05:11.620> boring

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
it can become mind-numbingly boring

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.610 
it can become mind-numbingly boring
after<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.610> while<00:05:12.640> if<00:05:12.940> that's<00:05:12.970> all<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.690> do<00:05:13.870> but

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620
