00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.469
 speaks vÃ­tor oak galley with another 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 video for you and today I'm here to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.170
 teach you to draw a child s 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.020
 so even daughters is a character zinho 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.760
 is brother to me for this same purpose and form 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.949
 and I 'm here to teach you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 I did it because I'm going to draw only 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.090
 daughters because I like him the most 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.340
 I do not know why this has stayed me 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 of babies as good as this 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 I liked it the most, my son can 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.160
 I brought you, it looks like it has a face 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 more a story so expensive but now it has 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.300
 raging so I'm going to draw good 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 think a simple drawing to do and see 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 people start to wake up it will start 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 with a triangle the angle 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 that's the way you are going to do it here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.219
 more or less this way 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 Ok, we 're going to start drawing the lines. 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.629
 very different here for the character already 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 bring his eye here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.750
 and here we will make another eye 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.970
 that's the way you are going to do it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.880
 here is more or less the basis 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 of him we see the eyebrow now as it is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.610
 simple design make the eyebrow 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.700
 Up here celebrating with a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.479
 square in which it is not a straight line here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.479
 We're going to make his hair, yes. 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.250
 Look here we do here it 's so and so 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.030
 our hair is made from our 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.039
 daughters 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.899
 still on the team line that is here is 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.580
 obvious that his nose was already on that tip. 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.990
 here we are going to make a real 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:51.090
 team down that's already nice ear 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:56.039
 Him for him and then we 'll do it here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.200
 already your smile and until you teach legal 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.759
 It will close with the neck 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.209
 He listened to us and will only do 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.390
 so it's round here we already have 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.209
 here the head of our children is ready 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:16.319
 simple touch to make the line a lot and 8 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:18.000
 and educational characters doing now 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.099
 People are going to make his body , right? 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
 make the chicken's body is very simple 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.290
 I'm going to give a decrease in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.150
 general patterns that exaggerations in the head 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.010
 but it's more or less the sheet 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.970
 It's over and we're going to do it like this. 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.859
 will trace here the shirt from here 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.609
 his shirt and here's gonna get a shorts 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:45.540
 and make too much bent too 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:48.470
 here we go his shirt a curve in it 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.750
 here being one in the neck 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.490
 curved people here is an exit from 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.690
 shirt but let's see more down yes 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:03.930
 very simple it has the patterns like this 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 we also closed here too shirt 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.830
 his 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.620
 Move it down here it will stay 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.420
 almost imperceptible behind the shorts 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.280
 team shirt 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.390
 who wants to make strong one in front of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.070
 other 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.960
 It's a pretty basic difference here and here. 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.210
 read people gonna plot that shirt 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.580
 he's going to have to be here with a 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:31.590
 straight if right not right 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.380
 a continuous line brings here we find 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.380
 his arm is very thin here 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.980
 We are going to go here and do it with 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.640
 that keeps him from remembering 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.490
 perspective we do - the digital is fine 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.100
 Also the ctt will go firm 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.060
 It reminds me a lot of who has done the channel 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:59.090
 Look, there, his shirt has some 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.360
 lines yes yes yes sir 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.360
 thus 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.070
 do not live here on the street said 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.190
 this way it is very interesting too 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.430
 he has a pocket here in the shorts we do 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:27.440
 that split the facts really 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:28.610
 people make the bottom of it here without half 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.330
 gallery 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:41.410
 without half we make the first sneakers 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:43.400
 so the sack of it is really so 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.400
 we do here 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.650
 tennis ground we see here the part 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.400
 from the front we only register him 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.400
 and so 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.010
 I think we'll do the same as the other one. 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.540
 only more up from a perspective 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.780
 also more could side and do follow 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.720
 the same pattern we do the part of the soil 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.240
 Let's the front band and the shoelace is 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.820
 made our daughters that same to 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.820
 you can add and 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.730
 do it any way you want 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:28.010
 I spoke at the time of his appointment. 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.790
 totally different touch 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.190
 reef lines 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.960
 the hit of the good line I hope you guys 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.730
 Did you like the class? Not everything is super. 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.370

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.170

 which is one of the most 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.330
 important to publicize the work of 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.490
 a content producer for youtube 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.260
 we also have a blog you drawings 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.450

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.490

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.580
 with facebook there I can materials that 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.240
 the use of videos and composting 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.770
 related to art 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.420
 we have here a list of 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.790
 production where you can find 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.730
 very interesting and varied content 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.710
 there in the channel and is also very important 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.600
 say that if you do not know the channel 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.430

 our project a project well 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.510
 interesting that many people have already adopted 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.820
 for them then come to harm us 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.950
 that makes a lot of difference for your 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.490
 I work there with art drawings and things 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.740
 of the genus 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.640
