 small messages for how to get the menu 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.410

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.780

 Of course you are welcome to do so with the blackboard 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.809

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.059
 cup systems then you can also the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.110
 Label the whole area more beautiful 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.100

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.360
 Also a black and white color contrast 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.820

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.820
 I'm going to live with that now 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.930
 now it is also dry after 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.560
 but the table is a certain time 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.909

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 and of course you can also join us 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.030

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.220
 No one uses my cup under mine 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.950
