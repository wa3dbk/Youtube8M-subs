00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.590
 I'll show you the video 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.170
 device for electric drill 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.929
 many will ask why do you need it 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.039
 device this device is needed 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:20.279
 so that ordinary electric drills 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.550
 make a small drilling machine 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.579
 at all 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.349
 I think every home master needs 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.320
 drilling machine is small at least 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.370
 but it happens as they say or no money 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.899
 missing or 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 there is little space in the apartment or house 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.989
 as they say manufacturers 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.249
 power tools have taken care and about 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:52.149
 this and made and made here 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:54.480
 drilling device mine for 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.920
 electric drill 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.839
 she is very good 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.269
 everything is functional enough 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:06.189
 adjustable height and depth 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.680
 lowering drill chuck 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.259
 in general, a good device is 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.850
 such a lever 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.619
 completely everything as they say goes down 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 like a real drilling machine 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.180
 will be very useful 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 home master who does not have 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.689
 drilling machine 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.079
 for example you need to drill 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.770
 circuit board or anything else in 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:36.369
 general hole of small diameter here 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.110
 such a device as for how at all 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.369
 use it take this 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.719
 electric drill is inserted into this 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:54.549
 landing hole and clamping here 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:55.090
 this screw and all your machine is ready for 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.820
 work 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.619
 insert the drill of the diameter you need 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.929
 but but I would not recommend thicker 5 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.860
 millimeters because the design 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:12.550
 enough how to say compact well not 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.040
 so well, not as powerful as for large 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.250
 verified 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.719
 but the home worker and what you need 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.109
 now I will show this fixture in 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.189
 action as it works and generally we will 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:39.590
 drill a hole 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:42.469
 small diameters so now i'm already 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:50.540
 drill set in advance now we will 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:53.139
 drill a plate like this including 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.139
 electric drill 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.959
 as you can see everything works fine and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:30.439
 Now I'm going to drill a hold here 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:30.439
 fishing line so turn on lecturer drill 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:05.280
 as you can see everything works fine in 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.770
 overall I recommend it is worth it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:15.209
 device cheap somewhere in the range 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:17.700
 20 dollars in general the most as they say 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.940
 Cheap budget option for young 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.260
 home master 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.080

 subscribe to my channel 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.220
 so by the way forgot to say more 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.580
 This device comes in 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.430
 such a small box it is completely 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.580
 quickly in seconds but say 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.240
 a second minute disassembled and back 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.590
 going to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.120
 and put us so small 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.669
 box in general, thank you all for 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.270
