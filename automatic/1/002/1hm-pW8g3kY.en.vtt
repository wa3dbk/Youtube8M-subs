00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 the year is drawing to a close and in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.670
 only a few days we fall already 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.710
 New Year's Eve What does the sector belong to? 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.650
 Of course, that's exactly what they do 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 firework here brave axedale 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.110
 New Year rockets and böller built 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.530
 are and therefore how they work 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530
 stay seated 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 what is firework rockets and 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.010
 firecrackers 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.300
 Let's start with the simple of 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.730
 both the böller or 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.560
 bang the explosive at this 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.970
 kind of pyrotechnics is behind 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.500
 a thick layer of glued 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.660
 Paper will become rarer too 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.010
 plastic fibers for use above and 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.020
 below, this tube becomes the same 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.820
 fabric closed only a small 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.680
 Opening remains in the one the ignition cord 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.970
 stuck with simple children's pictures 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.250
 this is a so-called 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.660
 Chinese fuse in the middle 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.519
 a thin core of black powder 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.320
 he is very thin with silk 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.340
 Paper was wrapped around this fuse 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.750
 is very cheap the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.850
 However, reliability leaves much to be desired 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.500
 the other between the so goes through the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.969
 small opening all the way to the actual 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 explosive and is empty 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.969
 unspectacular than you think it is 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 It's just about 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.720
 black powder and it will be off 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.370
 of course, as little as profit 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.900
 possible uses only a seventh of the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.240
 böller length is with black powder 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.950
 filled the rest of the vast space 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.930
 becomes clay or route throne earth 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.159
 filled up when igniting the wage 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.360
 sparks are spreading 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.640
 due to a chain reaction 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.070
 black powder to black powder 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.110
 come out of it and now it does not find any 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.670
 explosion instead of such a 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.649
 explosion takes place in a böller only 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.630
 a combustion instead of because of itself 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.399
 the pressure in the body increases as far as he 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.740
 bursting one calls this process also the 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.210
 fraction of the bang is therefore less 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.040
 by the sudden burning of the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 explosives but more through the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.530
 bursting of the citizens hall 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.570
 this principle will work for everyone 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.640
 children's pictures types used whether a b 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.310
 cd pictures super pictures 1 or 2 or 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.259
 Lady Gaga Now we come to the visual 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.509
 appeal to the fireworks rockets 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.130
 this pyrotechnic flying machine moves 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.659
 drivingly continued by a recoilless 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.640
 and at the highest point one distributes 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.560
 disintegrating charge an effect charge the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.420
 then caused wonderful light games 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.250
 Let's look at the propellant set first 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.289
 more precisely , there is a big one 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.939
 Part of black powder that it optical 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.039
 found with charcoal and alu or 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.539
 imprisonment is mixed in the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.410
 fuse is the same 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.850
 as with the citizens 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.380
 Most will here but still with a 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.700
 cap to piece in front of you 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.810
 moisture and accidental 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.910
 to ignite 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.250
 the whole is surrounded by a solid one 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.930
 papers not intended for the place 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.000
 The pressure is supposed to be controlled 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.430
 through a nozzle at the bottom 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.709
 and the rocket through 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.689
 drive cars after burning off the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.609
 propellant as the highest point of the 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.079
 rocket ignites the publisher 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.909
 charge this is out again 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.530
 Black powder and is there for the 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.299
 to dissipate the effect of charge 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.799
 and that's not so difficult 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.450
 because the effect let out namely 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.620
 many luminous globe is composed of the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.989
 again with different substances 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.739
 are filled depending on which color you are 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.170
 want to generate 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.810
 mostly alkaline or earthy 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.900
 alkali metal salts used bajumi grad 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.000
 produces, for example, green sodium nitrate cash flow 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.250
 June saw red cesium and potassium 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.769
 produce purple rubidium purplish and 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.959
 copper salts arsenic and lead give blue 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.609
 light off will be aluminum and 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.560
 magnesium chips for silver and 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.870
 whitish sparks used and charcoal 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.430
 and iron for golden a cap 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.049
 finally closes the rocket 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.060
 and provides the necessary aerodynamics 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.980
 one thing is missing but the light he died 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.569
 is glued to the side can on the one hand 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:25.829
 you start the rocket better 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:27.930
 our bigger one we are happy 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.340
 that is he so the wally and we are 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.560
 have heard you also know that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.669
 there are also with us, however 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.260
 topics on the edge 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.090
 So everything is not so mainstream 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.449
 but still very interesting 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.949
 is 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:44.750
 That's why we thought we would have 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:44.750
 fast the channel of bern exact 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.449
 technical problems no matter what I was 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.919
 actually he already finished Munich 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.299
 ever a happy rumgeballer of 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.949
 New Year's Eve and please do not forget that 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.509
 to rate video and meaning friends 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.979
 so everyone really knows 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.989
 what he actually did in the New Year's Eve 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.400
 sky shoots and firefighters to 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.409
 boring, look at it 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.579
 video for the construction of a nuclear bomb or 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.290
 you look through the emergence of the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.489
 Tide that is a topic 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.489
 that really everyone should know
