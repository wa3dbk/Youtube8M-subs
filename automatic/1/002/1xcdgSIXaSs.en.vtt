00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 and away they are the participants in the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 42nd edition of the Amsterdam Waterland 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.570
 marathon 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 it the cool of 23 km carries it 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 international field of participants through the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.990
 scenic north dutch 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990
 landscape 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 mouth stop sitting in the canoe is not there 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 at canoe association viking that the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.769
 contest organized namely has 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.970
 two about turns in the trail 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.739
 included 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.110
 one at monnickendam and one at ip 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.110
 and especially the latter is special 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.489
 afterwards it had to go a long way 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 through the meadow 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.570
 run further and therefore actually only one 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.729
 marathon in the world not such a one 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.739
 transferring this year do such a thing 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.019
 150 participants shared about 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 different classes the number of this 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.489
 year is in stark contrast to six 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 years ago with only 20 canoeists 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.890
 traffic the event when in a deep 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.140
 valley 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
 new organization for the helm for something 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.649
 we actually try to achieve is to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 also in midfield and in the 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.549
 backfield a whole by wide group 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.710
 get people so that everyone can 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.509
 enjoy the canoe and his own 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.100
 can compete and that is 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.439
 actually I think the basis of us 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.810
 success not only the world but 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.609
 make sure you have what is behind it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.770
 so your marathon sail on a whole 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.560
 to the general public or to them 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.179
 original way the 42nd edition of the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
 Amsterdam Waterland became a marathon 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.229
 decided in the sprint portuguese 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 marjo world champion 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.140
 she left competitors behind 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.749
 time of 1 hour 42 minutes and 15 seconds 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.999
 where you really unwise plaid there now 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:52.820
 barleycorn to go to the front 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:56.380
 stylight title for was to do detail 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.250
 that is then do find so up to date 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.000
 eye-cather front 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.170
 the race and that never let anyone the path 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.170
 and that you study and
