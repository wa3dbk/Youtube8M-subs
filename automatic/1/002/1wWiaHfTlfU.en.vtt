00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends welcome but a video of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.790
 motor video channel tech maintenance 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.210
 today we are with the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.090
 mercedes 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.179
 these goods 2008 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.770
 there is a class c customer was 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.220
 complaining that the panel was 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.960
 indicating the reset of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.510
 tire pressure 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 he was not with this fault and not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.990
 Do not know what you want. 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 We came here to spend the machine already 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 in what I explained to him the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.399
 when the account in that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 system when it happens to lose 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
 pressure the tire one of the tires of asia to a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.730
 sensor that has inside each 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 each of the works is sending a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 signal to the central station telling the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 tire pressure 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.910
 then when the pressure drops it indicates the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 problem 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.899
 grandson makes a repair or tire stamp 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.399
 Advice, he's going to stay later. 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 requesting that the panel be 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.870
 redefine and that is something where the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.239
 device can come here and at least 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.930
 steering wheel control 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.369
 if you show that we're going to enter 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.330
 here in message services pressure of the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.659
 tires 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 the author of tire pressure activated 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.780
 I already made personal approval, rock tire, right? 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.799
 thus confirms the control of the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.140
 tires race restarted a not solved 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.340
 no need no device for 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340
 This is not ruled out. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.020
 ae mercedes c200 peace and haste 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 this table is the one that has the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.039
 nettheim compressor type 1 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.799
 Which is the mechanical teacher who generates 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:17.470
 pressure as if it were a pipe 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:17.470
 Conventional cool and interesting 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.379
 a digital all of the good and the best baita 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.840
 car 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.220
 the staff then gets the tip and staff 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.890
 have mercedes 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.239
 Mercedes Benz when it's a problem is 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.950
 that when arrested an indication 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.840
 problem does not mean that the problem 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.239
 can only be the programming of the pressure of 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.910
 tires is even happening a lot in the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.250
 zone also which also has MS system 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.130
 only in fusion when the light is 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.209
 lit by a problem of doing for him 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.360
 Automatically he oo program 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.900
 offender he would return to the pressure 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.870
 over there 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.450
 in case the sensor breaks in the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.569
 Tire exchange cloud some repair ne 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.069
 there it has to be reprogrammed and here in the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.590
 motor to who has equipment made 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.650
 reprogramming the spindle also from tms 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.510
 according to several other cars the galley 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.100
 so we stayed here for another video of the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.709
 technocrats engine video channel 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.639
 automotive wish wish everyone a 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.639
 Happy new year 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.340
 if you like video can give that touch 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.010
 nCircle like like even more entered the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.810
 youtube and stretch and sign the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.760
 our video channel may continue 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.400
 receiving the receiving technical tips 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.060
 about maintenance the day of the workshop 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.970
 mechanics and other curiosities 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.540
 the staff until next year 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.540
