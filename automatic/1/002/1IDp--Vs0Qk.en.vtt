high<00:02:21.860> level<00:02:22.160> quests<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:23.030> gonna<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.330> harder

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
high level quests it's gonna be harder

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.150 
high level quests it's gonna be harder
and<00:02:23.959> it's<00:02:24.230> gonna<00:02:24.320> be<00:02:24.500> more<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.770> challenge

but I like a challenge

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.330 
but I like a challenge
the<00:02:26.540> only<00:02:26.690> reason<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.170> didn't<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:27.680> doing<00:02:27.920> PvE

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the only reason I didn't like doing PvE

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.880 
the only reason I didn't like doing PvE
in<00:02:28.640> questing<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.270> other<00:02:29.750> games<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.260> because

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
in questing in other games is because

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.030 
in questing in other games is because
almost<00:02:31.790> all<00:02:32.000> these<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:32.810> monsters<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.800> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
almost all these these monsters and and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.060 
almost all these these monsters and and
mobs<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.850> things<00:02:35.090> they're<00:02:35.570> simplified<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:37.010> a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
mobs and things they're simplified to a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.790 
mobs and things they're simplified to a
simple<00:02:37.550> strategy<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.709> you

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
simple strategy and you can when you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.650 
simple strategy and you can when you
fight<00:02:40.040> against<00:02:40.280> another<00:02:40.520> player<00:02:40.790> some

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
fight against another player some

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.540 
fight against another player some
players<00:02:41.900> are<00:02:42.080> harder<00:02:42.380> than<00:02:42.500> others<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.010> they

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
players are harder than others and they

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.550 
players are harder than others and they
give<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.970> challenge<00:02:44.510> because<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:45.380> have<00:02:45.530> a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
give you a challenge because they have a

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.500 
give you a challenge because they have a
mind<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.860> their<00:02:45.920> own<00:02:46.130> but<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.640> never<00:02:47.209> really

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
mind of their own but I never really

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.850 
mind of their own but I never really
thought<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.020> could<00:02:49.010> be<00:02:49.040> challenged<00:02:49.790> by

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
thought that I could be challenged by

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.280 
thought that I could be challenged by
these<00:02:51.860> quests<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.670> thought<00:02:53.120> maybe<00:02:53.720> it'd<00:02:53.959> be<00:02:53.989> too

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
these quests I thought maybe it'd be too

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.880 
these quests I thought maybe it'd be too
easy<00:02:54.500> there<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.610> be<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:56.270> chore<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.739> no

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
easy there just be a chore to do but no

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.199 
easy there just be a chore to do but no
