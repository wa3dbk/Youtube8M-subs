have been wondering what it takes to get
into<00:00:17.789> fpv<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> actually<00:00:18.720> fpv<00:00:19.140> has<00:00:19.289> been

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
into fpv and actually fpv has been

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
into fpv and actually fpv has been
really<00:00:20.189> driving<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> hobby<00:00:20.939> forward<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.570> the

a basic breakdown on on two of the most
common<00:00:33.180> beginner<00:00:33.390> fpv<00:00:34.020> setups<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
common beginner fpv setups right and the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.530 
common beginner fpv setups right and the
first<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> most<00:00:35.820> affordable<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
first one the most affordable is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000 
first one the most affordable is
something<00:00:36.899> similar<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
something similar to this this is a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
something similar to this this is a
little<00:00:38.250> Wi-Fi<00:00:38.640> quad<00:00:38.940> yeah<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> blade

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
little Wi-Fi quad yeah this is the blade

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
little Wi-Fi quad yeah this is the blade
glimpse<00:00:40.530> yep<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.329> comes

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
glimpse yep and this actually comes

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
glimpse yep and this actually comes
ready<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.840> fly<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> comes<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.550> mean

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
ready to fly and it comes with I mean

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.920 
ready to fly and it comes with I mean
everything<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
everything that you need right in the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
everything that you need right in the
box<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.469> already<00:00:46.770> built<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.219> there's<00:00:47.430> no

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
box and it's already built so there's no

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.190 
box and it's already built so there's no
guesswork<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:48.899> nice

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
guesswork which is really really nice

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.869 
guesswork which is really really nice
now<00:00:49.500> again<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> said<00:00:50.280> earlier<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
now again I said earlier this is

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
now again I said earlier this is
actually<00:00:51.420> using<00:00:51.690> Wi-Fi<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
actually using Wi-Fi so you have your

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
actually using Wi-Fi so you have your
iPhone<00:00:53.100> hooked<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
iPhone hooked up to here right and you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
iPhone hooked up to here right and you
get<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> free<00:00:54.750> app<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.289> download<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
get a free app that you can download to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.290 
get a free app that you can download to
see<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.850> looking<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
see what you're looking at with the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.029 
see what you're looking at with the
camera<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.199> school<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.770> affordable

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
camera so school and it's affordable

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
camera so school and it's affordable
that's<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> biggest<00:00:59.789> thing<00:00:59.969> about<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.390> Wi-Fi

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that's the biggest thing about the Wi-Fi

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.150 
that's the biggest thing about the Wi-Fi
quads<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> we've<00:01:01.770> done<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> couple

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
quads like this and we've done a couple

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
quads like this and we've done a couple
similar<00:01:03.000> models<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> past<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:04.049> Wi-Fi

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
similar models in the past with Wi-Fi

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.990 
similar models in the past with Wi-Fi
technology<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> works<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:05.909> really

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
technology and it works really really

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
technology and it works really really
well<00:01:06.270> especially<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.930> you're<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> beginner<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
well especially if you're a beginner and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.830 
well especially if you're a beginner and
you<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.070> no<00:01:08.340> equipment<00:01:08.939> starting<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.420> right

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you have no equipment starting out right

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.210 
you have no equipment starting out right
you<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.229> goggles<00:01:10.500> yet<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.070> don't

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you don't have goggles yet you don't

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
you don't have goggles yet you don't
have<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> transmitter<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.439> one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
have a transmitter this is all in one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.810 
have a transmitter this is all in one
package<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> particular

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
package and this one in particular

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630 
package and this one in particular
starts<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.630> about<00:01:15.860> $220<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:16.890> ready<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> fly

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
starts at about $220 for ready to fly

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.249 
starts at about $220 for ready to fly
now<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> things<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> keep<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.229> mind

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
now one of the things to keep in mind

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
now one of the things to keep in mind
with<00:01:19.590> Wi-Fi<00:01:19.950> quads<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> little<00:01:21.240> bit

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
with Wi-Fi quads is there's a little bit

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
with Wi-Fi quads is there's a little bit
of<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.170> attic<00:01:22.470> cam<00:01:22.680> so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
of little bit of a little attic cam so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
of little bit of a little attic cam so
when<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.070> flying<00:01:23.280> whatever<00:01:24.210> you're

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
when you're flying whatever you're

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
when you're flying whatever you're
seeing<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> screen<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.380> typically<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
seeing on the screen is typically like a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.469 
seeing on the screen is typically like a
fraction<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> second<00:01:27.060> behind<00:01:27.180> which

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
fraction of a second behind which

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
fraction of a second behind which
doesn't<00:01:27.780> sound<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.380> deal<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:29.220> gonna

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
doesn't sound like a big deal I'm gonna

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.710 
doesn't sound like a big deal I'm gonna
be<00:01:29.430> playing<00:01:29.700> indoors<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.270> we're<00:01:30.450> gonna<00:01:30.540> be

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
be playing indoors like we're gonna be

be playing indoors like we're gonna be
doing<00:01:30.960> today<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.040> makes<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> big

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
doing today it can it makes a big

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
doing today it can it makes a big
difference<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.150> cause<00:01:33.360> some<00:01:33.570> trouble

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
difference it can cause some trouble

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
difference it can cause some trouble
however<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:35.640> open

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
however if you're out know in an open

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.550 
however if you're out know in an open
field<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.450> works<00:01:36.630> great<00:01:36.869> another<00:01:37.320> cool<00:01:37.530> thing

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
field it works great another cool thing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
field it works great another cool thing
to<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.189> Wi-Fi<00:01:38.460> quads<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.810> can

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
to do with these Wi-Fi quads is you can

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
to do with these Wi-Fi quads is you can
fly<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> quad<00:01:40.590> line-of-sight<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.369> your

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
fly the quad line-of-sight with your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
fly the quad line-of-sight with your
eyes<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.479> give<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> phone<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> one

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
eyes and you can give the phone to one

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.870 
eyes and you can give the phone to one
of<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.680> friends<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.250> take<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> ride

alright it's pretty fun yeah another

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
alright it's pretty fun yeah another
thing<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.670> comes<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
thing is this comes with a this one in

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.899 
thing is this comes with a this one in
particular<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.710> glimpse<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.369> comes<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
particular the glimpse it comes with a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.429 
particular the glimpse it comes with a
little<00:01:51.329> camera<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> front<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.140> extra

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
little camera on the front there extra

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.139 
little camera on the front there extra
records<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.009> HD<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> pretty<00:01:53.909> cool

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
records in HD which is pretty cool

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
records in HD which is pretty cool
obviously<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> GoPro<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.710> anything

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
obviously it's not a GoPro or anything

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
obviously it's not a GoPro or anything
but<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.880> HD<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.420> works<00:01:57.780> pretty<00:01:57.930> well

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
but it is HD and it works pretty well

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.469 
but it is HD and it works pretty well
now<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> other<00:01:58.799> alternative<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.640> flying<00:02:00.030> fpv

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
now the other alternative to flying fpv

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
now the other alternative to flying fpv
when<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.049> started<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> most<00:02:01.799> common<00:02:02.219> I'd

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
when you get started the most common I'd

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
when you get started the most common I'd
say<00:02:02.430> would<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.579> 5.8<00:02:03.119> gigahertz<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.990> if

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
say would be 5.8 gigahertz right but if

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.300 
say would be 5.8 gigahertz right but if
you're<00:02:04.320> gonna<00:02:04.439> buy<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> you're

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you're gonna buy one of those and you're

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
you're gonna buy one of those and you're
talking<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.670> price<00:02:05.880> point<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.450> twice

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
talking that price point of like twice

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.910 
talking that price point of like twice
as<00:02:06.990> much<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.500> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
as much like that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.859 
as much like that
for<00:02:08.369> example<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> blade<00:02:09.149> Nano<00:02:09.420> which<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
for example the blade Nano which is a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.020 
for example the blade Nano which is a
comparable<00:02:10.319> model<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> glimpse<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.610> uses

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
comparable model to the glimpse it uses

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.240 
comparable model to the glimpse it uses
5.8<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.140> basically<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.830> get<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.130> you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
5.8 so basically what you get when you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.520 
5.8 so basically what you get when you
pay<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> extra<00:02:14.730> money<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.510> 5.8<00:02:16.110> or<00:02:16.290> even

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
pay the extra money for like 5.8 or even

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.410 
pay the extra money for like 5.8 or even
if<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:17.010> 1.3<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:18.000> any<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.360> those

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
if you want like 1.3 or any of those

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.840 
if you want like 1.3 or any of those
other<00:02:18.569> frequencies<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.410> there's<00:02:20.100> no<00:02:20.280> leg<00:02:20.520> so

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
other frequencies is there's no leg so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.820 
other frequencies is there's no leg so
exactly<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.450> you've<00:02:21.600> seen<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> goggles<00:02:22.410> or

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
exactly what you've seen the goggles or

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
exactly what you've seen the goggles or
on<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.100> fpv<00:02:23.490> screen<00:02:23.790> that's<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.330> exactly

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
on your fpv screen that's that's exactly

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.270 
on your fpv screen that's that's exactly
what<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.170> quad<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.530> seeing<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> lot

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
what the quad is seeing it's a lot

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.949 
what the quad is seeing it's a lot
better<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:26.730> flying<00:02:27.000> aggressively<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.810> see

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
better for flying aggressively you see

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.690 
better for flying aggressively you see
these<00:02:28.110> crazy<00:02:28.380> fpv<00:02:28.830> videos<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.280> people<00:02:29.400> flying

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
these crazy fpv videos of people flying

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
these crazy fpv videos of people flying
through<00:02:29.820> trees<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.510> stuff<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.020> yeah

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
through trees and stuff like that yeah

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.449 
through trees and stuff like that yeah
that's<00:02:31.530> typically<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.070> they're<00:02:32.250> using

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
that's typically what they're using

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.760 
that's typically what they're using
Wi-Fi<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.660> other<00:02:33.840> hand<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.260> great<00:02:34.620> for

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
Wi-Fi on the other hand is great for

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.410 
Wi-Fi on the other hand is great for
beginners<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.459> obviously<00:02:36.030> comes<00:02:36.209> at<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
beginners and it obviously comes at a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.850 
beginners and it obviously comes at a
lesser<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> price<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.380> what<00:02:37.440> we're<00:02:37.590> gonna<00:02:37.650> do

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
lesser of a price so what we're gonna do

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.710 
lesser of a price so what we're gonna do
is<00:02:37.950> we're<00:02:38.069> gonna<00:02:38.130> upgrade<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> 5.8<00:02:39.569> so

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
is we're gonna upgrade this to 5.8 so

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.729 
is we're gonna upgrade this to 5.8 so
that<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:39.959> can<00:02:40.080> show<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.440> difference

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
that we can show you the difference

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.290 
that we can show you the difference
between<00:02:40.800> what<00:02:41.160> you'd<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.459> on<00:02:41.550> Wi-Fi<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.270> your

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
between what you'd see on Wi-Fi on your

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.510 
between what you'd see on Wi-Fi on your
phone<00:02:42.630> or<00:02:43.050> at<00:02:43.470> five<00:02:43.650> point<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.160> goggles

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520

phone or at five point in the goggles
all<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.330> well<00:02:45.450> now<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:45.900> our

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
all right well now that we have our

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.080 
all right well now that we have our
little<00:02:46.530> glimpse<00:02:46.950> friend<00:02:47.250> suit<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.790> up<00:02:47.910> with

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
little glimpse friend suit it up with

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.270 
little glimpse friend suit it up with
his<00:02:48.300> little<00:02:48.540> 5.8<00:02:49.260> party<00:02:49.530> hat<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.130> make

his little 5.8 party hat we can make

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
his little 5.8 party hat we can make
this<00:02:50.400> side-by-side<00:02:51.060> comparison<00:02:51.720> show<00:02:52.050> you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
this side-by-side comparison show you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.600 
this side-by-side comparison show you
the<00:02:52.230> differences<00:02:52.709> between<00:02:52.769> we<00:02:53.250> got<00:02:53.400> Wi-Fi

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the differences between we got Wi-Fi

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
the differences between we got Wi-Fi
over<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.080> five<00:02:55.260> point<00:02:55.500> eight

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
over here and the five point eight

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.310 
over here and the five point eight
signal<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.100> here<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.519> basically<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.630> up<00:02:57.989> here

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
signal in here so basically this up here

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.960 
signal in here so basically this up here
is<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> five<00:02:58.830> point<00:02:59.070> eight<00:02:59.130> module<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.820> can

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
is a five point eight module and you can

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.460 
is a five point eight module and you can
actually<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.600> these<00:03:00.750> from<00:03:01.019> Horizon

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
actually get one of these from Horizon

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.680 
actually get one of these from Horizon
hobby<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:01.860> about<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> hundred<00:03:02.310> bucks<00:03:02.690> super

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690

little<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.130> cell<00:03:05.370> battery<00:03:05.730> which<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.060> also

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
little one cell battery which I also

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.910 
little one cell battery which I also
hide<00:03:06.480> glue<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.750> onto<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> back<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.440> this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
hide glue it onto the back there this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
hide glue it onto the back there this
camera<00:03:08.250> does<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.580> record<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.030> only<00:03:09.180> transmits

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
camera does not record it only transmits

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.050

the<00:03:09.989> video<00:03:10.230> bottom<00:03:10.980> camera<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.519> actually<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the video bottom camera is actually the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.030 
the video bottom camera is actually the
Wi-Fi<00:03:12.660> camera<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.500> coming<00:03:13.769> through<00:03:13.799> my

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
Wi-Fi camera so it's coming through my

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.509 
Wi-Fi camera so it's coming through my
iPhone<00:03:14.190> here<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.959> also<00:03:16.170> records<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.070> HD

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
iPhone here and it also records the HD

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.789 
iPhone here and it also records the HD
video<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.940> an<00:03:18.239> onboard<00:03:18.780> memory<00:03:19.079> card<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.680> we're

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
video to an onboard memory card so we're

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.530 
video to an onboard memory card so we're
gonna<00:03:19.920> kind<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.730> side-by-side

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
gonna kind of do a side-by-side

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.590 
gonna kind of do a side-by-side
comparison<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.799> show<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.250> guys<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:24.420> true

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
comparison and show you guys the true

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.660 
comparison and show you guys the true
differences<00:03:25.019> between<00:03:25.200> Wi-Fi<00:03:25.709> versus<00:03:26.040> 5.8

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
differences between Wi-Fi versus 5.8

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
differences between Wi-Fi versus 5.8
watch<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.329> for<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.570> throw<00:03:27.780> pillows

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.580 

so<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.560> tight<00:03:34.799> area<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.220> indoors<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.849> here

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so in a tight area like indoors in here

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.140 
so in a tight area like indoors in here
Wi-Fi<00:03:37.590> might<00:03:37.830> not<00:03:37.980> be<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.220> best<00:03:38.370> bet<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:39.030> if

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
Wi-Fi might not be the best bet but if

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.449 
Wi-Fi might not be the best bet but if
you're<00:03:39.269> out<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.540> open<00:03:40.049> field<00:03:40.409> you<00:03:41.310> can

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
you're out in the open field you can

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.920 
you're out in the open field you can
definitely<00:03:41.610> get<00:03:41.909> away<00:03:42.120> with<00:03:42.239> using<00:03:42.390> Wi-Fi<00:03:42.659> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
definitely get away with using Wi-Fi to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.309 
definitely get away with using Wi-Fi to
get<00:03:43.620> some<00:03:43.799> FPV<00:03:44.220> practice<00:03:45.080> but<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.170> you're

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
get some FPV practice but if you're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.140 
get some FPV practice but if you're
really<00:03:46.500> looking<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.950> push<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.280> limits<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.760> do

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
really looking to push the limits and do

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.720 
really looking to push the limits and do
some<00:03:48.360> proximity<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.110> flying<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:50.459> probably

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
some proximity for flying you probably

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.729 
some proximity for flying you probably
want<00:03:50.879> to<00:03:50.909> do<00:03:51.030> something<00:03:51.269> more<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:51.720> 5.8<00:03:52.409> it

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
want to do something more like 5.8 it

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.740 
want to do something more like 5.8 it
seems<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.190> 5.2<00:03:53.909> you<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.299> wider

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
seems like with the 5.2 you have a wider

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.180 
seems like with the 5.2 you have a wider
range<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:56.459> view<00:03:56.700> as<00:03:56.879> well<00:03:57.500> yeah<00:03:58.500> yeah<00:03:58.799> this

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
range of view as well yeah yeah this

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.860 
range of view as well yeah yeah this
that<00:03:59.489> little<00:03:59.730> module<00:04:00.209> has<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.360> much<00:04:00.840> wider

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
that little module has a much wider

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.750 
that little module has a much wider
camera<00:04:01.620> yeah<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.340> I'm<00:04:02.400> going<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.700> kitchen

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
camera yeah so I'm going in the kitchen

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.710 
camera yeah so I'm going in the kitchen
here<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.400> staticky<00:04:05.790> for<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.060> there's

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
here is it staticky for you there's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.420 
here is it staticky for you there's
Austin<00:04:07.200> do<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.709> way<00:04:07.829> ma'am<00:04:08.069> eating

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
working hard yeah you do get quite a bit

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.140 
working hard yeah you do get quite a bit
of<00:04:14.400> static<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.859> see<00:04:17.190> what<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.549> go<00:04:17.699> go<00:04:18.090> up

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
of static so see what we can go go up

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.840 
of static so see what we can go go up
here<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:18.829> which<00:04:19.829> gets<00:04:20.070> better<00:04:20.280> range<00:04:20.579> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
here see which gets better range the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.800 
here see which gets better range the
Wi-Fi<00:04:21.239> or<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.449> five-pointed

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.290 

it<00:04:29.800> looks<00:04:30.070> like<00:04:30.190> okay<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.639> five-pointed<00:04:31.150> on

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
it looks like okay the five-pointed on

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.270 
it looks like okay the five-pointed on
my<00:04:31.510> goggles<00:04:31.780> are<00:04:32.110> really<00:04:32.590> yeah<00:04:32.980> it's<00:04:33.130> pretty

my goggles are really yeah it's pretty

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.000 
my goggles are really yeah it's pretty
bad<00:04:33.460> in<00:04:33.520> screen<00:04:33.910> two<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:35.230> now<00:04:35.470> we're<00:04:35.889> going

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
bad in screen two and now we're going

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.159 
bad in screen two and now we're going
through<00:04:36.370> some<00:04:36.550> serious<00:04:36.820> stuff<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.720> Wi-Fi

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
through some serious stuff but the Wi-Fi

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.170 
through some serious stuff but the Wi-Fi
is<00:04:38.230> completely<00:04:38.710> frozen<00:04:39.010> yeah<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.790> Wi-Fi

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
is completely frozen yeah and the Wi-Fi

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.360 
is completely frozen yeah and the Wi-Fi
froze<00:04:40.480> on<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.720> way<00:04:40.810> up<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.020> steps<00:04:41.290> but<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
froze on the way up the steps but the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.250 
froze on the way up the steps but the
the<00:04:42.669> 5.8<00:04:43.150> velocity<00:04:43.630> let<00:04:43.750> me<00:04:43.810> go<00:04:43.900> grab<00:04:44.080> it

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
the 5.8 velocity let me go grab it

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.860 
the 5.8 velocity let me go grab it
so<00:04:45.070> just<00:04:45.310> had<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.460> crash<00:04:45.730> how<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.419> handle<00:04:46.750> it

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
so just had a crash how to handle it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.120 
so just had a crash how to handle it
actually<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.530> looks<00:04:47.680> pretty<00:04:47.860> good<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.040> don't

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
actually it looks pretty good I don't

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.250 
actually it looks pretty good I don't
think<00:04:48.310> has<00:04:48.430> any<00:04:48.550> damage<00:04:48.910> at<00:04:49.000> all<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.960> even<00:04:49.990> any

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
think has any damage at all not even any

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.140 
think has any damage at all not even any
prop<00:04:50.530> damage<00:04:50.710> it's<00:04:51.130> pretty<00:04:51.280> cool<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.820> recap

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
prop damage it's pretty cool to recap

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.810 
prop damage it's pretty cool to recap
for<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.419> guys<00:04:52.540> 5.8<00:04:53.320> versus<00:04:53.620> Wi-Fi<00:04:54.070> yeah<00:04:54.520> it's

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
for you guys 5.8 versus Wi-Fi yeah it's

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.280 
for you guys 5.8 versus Wi-Fi yeah it's
a<00:04:54.940> great<00:04:55.090> way<00:04:55.150> Wi-Fi<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.930> great<00:04:56.110> way<00:04:56.260> if

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
a great way Wi-Fi is a great way if

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.690 
a great way Wi-Fi is a great way if
you're<00:04:56.530> just<00:04:56.770> starting<00:04:56.950> out<00:04:57.100> if<00:04:57.310> you're<00:04:57.460> new

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
you're just starting out if you're new

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.790 
you're just starting out if you're new
but<00:04:57.910> especially<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.660> fpb<00:04:59.169> it's<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.620> great

but especially it's you fpb it's a great

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.010 
but especially it's you fpb it's a great
way<00:04:59.889> to<00:04:59.919> get<00:05:00.040> started<00:05:00.430> yep<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:00.970> if<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:01.870> if

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
way to get started yep and if it's if

way to get started yep and if it's if
you're<00:05:02.169> looking<00:05:02.380> for<00:05:02.500> your<00:05:02.620> first<00:05:02.770> quad<00:05:03.130> and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
you're looking for your first quad and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.650 
you're looking for your first quad and
you've<00:05:03.520> never<00:05:03.790> flown<00:05:04.030> before<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.570> you're

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
you've never flown before and you're

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.390 
you've never flown before and you're
looking<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:04.960> learn<00:05:05.080> how<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.290> fly<00:05:05.500> yeah<00:05:06.100> maybe

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
looking to learn how to fly yeah maybe

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.129 
looking to learn how to fly yeah maybe
record<00:05:06.850> some<00:05:07.000> images<00:05:07.389> from<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.660> air<00:05:07.840> and

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
record some images from the air and

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.530 
record some images from the air and
potentially<00:05:08.889> getting<00:05:09.100> into<00:05:09.790> fpv<00:05:10.270> flying

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
potentially getting into fpv flying

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.060 
potentially getting into fpv flying
through<00:05:10.720> your<00:05:10.750> camera<00:05:10.990> Wi-Fi<00:05:11.770> is<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.919> good

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
through your camera Wi-Fi is a good

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.170 
through your camera Wi-Fi is a good
alternative<00:05:12.190> because<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.760> get<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:12.910> lot<00:05:13.090> of

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
alternative because you get a lot of

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.550 
alternative because you get a lot of
bang<00:05:13.300> for<00:05:13.330> your<00:05:13.600> buck<00:05:13.750> yeah<00:05:14.050> for<00:05:14.260> sure

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
bang for your buck yeah for sure

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.379 
bang for your buck yeah for sure
however<00:05:15.040> if<00:05:15.190> you're<00:05:15.310> familiar<00:05:15.460> with<00:05:15.820> flying

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
however if you're familiar with flying

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.570 
however if you're familiar with flying
wands<00:05:17.139> and<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.470> want<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.770> really<00:05:18.130> dive<00:05:18.370> into

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
wands and you want to really dive into

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.080 
wands and you want to really dive into
fpv<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.180> do<00:05:19.300> some<00:05:19.540> fast<00:05:20.080> proximity<00:05:20.919> flying

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
fpv and do some fast proximity flying

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.040 
fpv and do some fast proximity flying
you're<00:05:22.090> gonna<00:05:22.210> want<00:05:22.600> to<00:05:22.660> go<00:05:22.750> with<00:05:22.870> something

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
you're gonna want to go with something

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.200 
you're gonna want to go with something
with<00:05:23.169> a<00:05:23.260> 5.8<00:05:23.860> now<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.130> can<00:05:24.370> DIY<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:25.120> know

scratch build your own you can buy
something<00:05:27.639> like<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.940> Nano<00:05:28.120> QX<00:05:28.630> which<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.139> very

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
something like the Nano QX which is very

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.200 
something like the Nano QX which is very
similar<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:30.250> setup<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.610> we<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:31.120> we

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
similar to this setup that we that we

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.360 
similar to this setup that we that we
get<00:05:31.750> ourselves<00:05:31.870> this<00:05:32.530> particular<00:05:33.039> setup<00:05:33.280> we

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
get ourselves this particular setup we

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.670 
get ourselves this particular setup we
showed<00:05:33.669> you<00:05:33.820> guys<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:34.840> show<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.200> comparison

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
showed you guys to show the comparison

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.340 
showed you guys to show the comparison
between<00:05:35.950> Wi-Fi<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.729> 5.8<00:05:37.270> but<00:05:37.450> actually<00:05:37.960> to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
between Wi-Fi and 5.8 but actually to

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.650 
between Wi-Fi and 5.8 but actually to
put<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:38.650> mod<00:05:38.890> on<00:05:39.190> here<00:05:39.580> then<00:05:40.210> you'd<00:05:40.360> have<00:05:40.479> to

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
put this mod on here then you'd have to

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.840 
put this mod on here then you'd have to
buy<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.840> fat<00:05:41.500> shark<00:05:41.740> goggles<00:05:42.220> actually<00:05:42.729> more

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
buy a fat shark goggles actually more

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.430 
buy a fat shark goggles actually more
expensive<00:05:43.000> than<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.450> nanotubes<00:05:43.960> yeah<00:05:44.320> they

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
expensive than the nanotubes yeah they

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.260 
expensive than the nanotubes yeah they
are<00:05:44.560> QX<00:05:44.919> we<00:05:45.370> highly<00:05:45.729> recommend<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:46.090> Nano

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
are QX we highly recommend the Nano

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.610 
are QX we highly recommend the Nano
cubes<00:05:46.570> as<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.810> guys<00:05:46.960> all<00:05:47.169> know<00:05:47.320> you've<00:05:47.470> seen

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
cubes as you guys all know you've seen

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.320 
cubes as you guys all know you've seen
our<00:05:47.740> past<00:05:47.919> videos<00:05:48.280> on<00:05:48.460> it<00:05:48.580> but<00:05:48.880> yeah<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.030> hope
