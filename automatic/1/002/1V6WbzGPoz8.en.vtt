you know just being an idiot okay so
that's<00:02:50.819> how<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.000> use<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.360> shade<00:02:51.629> couch

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
that's how we use the shade couch

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.250 
that's how we use the shade couch
technique<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.640> what<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.209> out<00:02:55.200> of

dime<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:56.480> I'll<00:02:57.480> run<00:02:57.690> something<00:02:58.019> like<00:02:58.110> this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
dime is I'll run something like this

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.559 
dime is I'll run something like this
I'll<00:02:58.380> show<00:02:58.410> blitz<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.060> get<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.329> press

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
I'll show blitz so that I get this press

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.240 
I'll show blitz so that I get this press
on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.140> outside<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.940> will<00:03:03.530> send<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.620> pressure<00:03:04.890> so

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
on the outside I will send a pressure so

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.270 
on the outside I will send a pressure so
I'll<00:03:05.610> send<00:03:05.849> it<00:03:05.970> off<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> right<00:03:06.420> here<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:06.959> saw<00:03:07.920> re

inside this is gonna give me heavy

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.630 
inside this is gonna give me heavy
pressure<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.379> it's<00:03:19.980> gonna<00:03:20.129> force<00:03:20.400> him<00:03:20.579> to

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
pressure and it's gonna force him to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.729 
pressure and it's gonna force him to
make<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.879> quick<00:03:21.420> read<00:03:21.660> with<00:03:21.900> everybody<00:03:22.349> shaded

press on Graham and on woods and we're
gonna<00:03:55.380> shade<00:03:55.739> both<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.340> them<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.669> inside

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
gonna shade both of them to the inside

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.460 
gonna shade both of them to the inside
because<00:03:57.299> they're<00:03:57.480> gonna<00:03:57.599> run<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.200> because

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
because they're gonna run so because

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.629 
because they're gonna run so because
these<00:03:58.560> things<00:03:58.650> are<00:03:58.769> gonna<00:03:58.919> run<00:03:59.040> finance<00:03:59.519> or

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
these things are gonna run finance or

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.659 
these things are gonna run finance or
something<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.630> now<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.019> see<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:02.040> idea<00:04:02.400> here

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
something and now you see the idea here

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.589 
something and now you see the idea here
behind<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.840> defense<00:04:04.319> okay<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:06.239> that's<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
behind the defense okay so that's the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.620 
behind the defense okay so that's the
basics<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:08.489> shading<00:04:08.940> techniques<00:04:09.329> how<00:04:09.599> to

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
basics of the shading techniques how to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.900 
basics of the shading techniques how to
individually<00:04:10.470> press<00:04:10.739> individual<00:04:11.370> shade<00:04:11.609> out

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
individually press individual shade out

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.059 
individually press individual shade out
will<00:04:12.269> have<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.660> write<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.410> all<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.799> ins<00:04:13.950> and

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
will have to write and all the ins and

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.310 
will have to write and all the ins and
outs<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.459> what<00:04:14.669> shading<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.690> do<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.200> you

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
outs of what shading can do for you you

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.289 
outs of what shading can do for you you
can<00:04:16.440> also<00:04:16.620> spotlight<00:04:17.310> receivers<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.060> if<00:04:18.150> we're

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
can also spotlight receivers so if we're

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.330 
can also spotlight receivers so if we're
running<00:04:18.389> like<00:04:18.599> a<00:04:18.690> cover<00:04:18.900> three<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.560> we<00:04:20.099> think

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
running like a cover three and we think

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.800 
running like a cover three and we think
we're<00:04:20.729> thinking<00:04:21.060> there's<00:04:21.299> gonna<00:04:21.419> be<00:04:21.539> an<00:04:21.630> outer

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
we're thinking there's gonna be an outer

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.510 
we're thinking there's gonna be an outer
out<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.289> left<00:04:22.710> side<00:04:22.830> we're<00:04:23.190> gonna<00:04:23.280> put

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
out to the left side we're gonna put

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.879 
out to the left side we're gonna put
Jenkins<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.120> buzz<00:04:24.360> zone<00:04:24.740> shade<00:04:25.740> our

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
Jenkins in a buzz zone shade our

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.040 
Jenkins in a buzz zone shade our
coverage<00:04:26.220> out<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.820> we're<00:04:26.940> gonna

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
coverage out and we're gonna

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.330 
coverage out and we're gonna
individually<00:04:28.050> spotlight<00:04:28.650> him<00:04:28.890> because<00:04:29.190> we

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
individually spotlight him because we

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.620 
individually spotlight him because we
definitely<00:04:29.789> do<00:04:29.880> not<00:04:29.909> want<00:04:30.270> them<00:04:30.390> throwing

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
definitely do not want them throwing

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.469 
definitely do not want them throwing
that<00:04:30.719> out<00:04:30.900> route<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.380> Johnson<00:04:32.250> well<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.300> here

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
that out route to Johnson well so here

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.310 
that out route to Johnson well so here
you<00:04:33.570> go<00:04:33.690> snap

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
you go snap

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.260 
you go snap
always<00:04:34.470> spotlighting<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.370> now<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:35.910> see

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
always spotlighting and now you see

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.910 
always spotlighting and now you see
Jenkins<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:36.960> actually<00:04:37.230> gonna<00:04:37.350> go<00:04:37.500> out<00:04:37.680> there

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
Jenkins is actually gonna go out there

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.360 
Jenkins is actually gonna go out there
now<00:04:38.550> obviously<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.600> you're<00:04:40.260> really<00:04:40.830> high<00:04:41.340> I

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
now obviously if you're really high I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.880 
now obviously if you're really high I
guess<00:04:41.820> like<00:04:42.000> my<00:04:42.150> team<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.480> today<00:04:42.890> sometimes
