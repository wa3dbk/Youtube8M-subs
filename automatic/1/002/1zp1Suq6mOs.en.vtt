only<00:00:08.280> three<00:00:08.900> the<00:00:09.900> hell<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> top<00:00:10.530> three<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
only three the hell at the top three the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.700 
only three the hell at the top three the
top<00:00:11.429> three<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.480> think<00:00:14.120> number<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.719> talent

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
top three I think number one is talent

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.310 
top three I think number one is talent
which<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.460> think<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.840> advisedly

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
which I think I use that advisedly

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.300 
which I think I use that advisedly
because<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:19.680> people<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.100> do

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
because some people would like to do

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.740 
because some people would like to do
this<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.000> don't<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.510> don't

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
this you have it or you don't I don't

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
this you have it or you don't I don't
believe<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.650> think<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.760> it

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
believe that I think that you can get it

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.679 
believe that I think that you can get it
so<00:00:25.050> maybe<00:00:26.010> scratch<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.789> no<00:00:26.970> talent<00:00:27.359> okay

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so maybe scratch that no talent okay

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.019 
so maybe scratch that no talent okay
number<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.590> persistence<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.880> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
number one is persistence you have to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.550 
number one is persistence you have to
keep<00:00:30.150> writing<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.019> no<00:00:31.289> matter<00:00:31.410> how

to<00:00:53.969> write<00:00:54.149> by<00:00:54.360> yourself<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.710> don't

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to write by yourself because you don't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
to write by yourself because you don't
get<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.340> feedback<00:00:56.579> whatsoever<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.960> also

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
get any feedback whatsoever and also

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
get any feedback whatsoever and also
writing<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> soul<00:00:59.820> destroying

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
writing can be a soul destroying

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.700 
writing can be a soul destroying
business<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> send<00:01:01.199> stuff<00:01:01.350> out<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
business and that you send stuff out and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.290 
business and that you send stuff out and
you<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.250> one-line<00:01:02.850> rejection

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you get like these one-line rejection

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719 
you get like these one-line rejection
saying<00:01:03.750> sorry<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.769> me

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
saying sorry not for me

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.020 
saying sorry not for me
that's<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.860> difficult<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> work<00:01:08.549> through<00:01:08.820> on

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that's it's difficult to work through on

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
that's it's difficult to work through on
your<00:01:09.090> own<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> need<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> support

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
your own and I think you need a support

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
your own and I think you need a support
group<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.710> people<00:01:11.010> telling<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.729> you're

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you're good enough and that you can do

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
you're good enough and that you can do
it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:16.590> important<00:01:16.950> thing<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
