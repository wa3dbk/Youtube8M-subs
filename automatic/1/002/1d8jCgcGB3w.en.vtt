Mario<00:00:39.239> 64<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
Mario 64 and I think that's not just a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160 
Mario 64 and I think that's not just a
gimmick<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.030> accurate<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.960> game

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
gimmick it really is accurate this game

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.320 
gimmick it really is accurate this game
really<00:00:43.320> harkens<00:00:43.739> back<00:00:43.830> to<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.250> n64<00:00:44.790> classic

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
really harkens back to that n64 classic

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.299 
really harkens back to that n64 classic
but<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.870> also<00:00:46.020> has<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.590> new<00:00:46.739> feeling<00:00:47.129> about

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
but it also has a very new feeling about

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.950 
but it also has a very new feeling about
it<00:00:47.370> I've<00:00:48.030> said<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.300> before<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> I'll<00:00:48.780> say<00:00:48.809> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
doesn't really abuse it thankfully what

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
doesn't really abuse it thankfully what
i<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.369> mean<00:01:47.549> by<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> game

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
i really mean by that is that the game

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
i really mean by that is that the game
knows<00:01:48.720> its<00:01:48.960> limits<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:50.220> using<00:01:50.460> analog

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
knows its limits so you are using analog

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.640 
knows its limits so you are using analog
control<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> control<00:01:51.509> mario<00:01:52.080> but<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> same

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
control to control mario but at the same

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.620 
control to control mario but at the same

it's very tight it's very responsive and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.650 
it's very tight it's very responsive and
simply<00:02:34.370> running<00:02:34.580> around<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.910> levels<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.480> so

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
simply running around the levels is so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.630 
simply running around the levels is so
much<00:02:35.810> fun<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.740> long<00:02:37.220> jump<00:02:37.550> and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
much fun because you can long jump and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.370 
much fun because you can long jump and
you<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:37.790> string<00:02:38.240> together<00:02:38.390> triple<00:02:38.930> jumps<00:02:39.200> I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
you can string together triple jumps I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.320 
you can string together triple jumps I
actually<00:02:40.250> think<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.580> process<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:41.060> exploring

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
actually think the process of exploring

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.420 
actually think the process of exploring
levels<00:02:41.870> are<00:02:42.020> simply<00:02:42.320> goofing<00:02:42.710> off<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:43.130> more

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
levels are simply goofing off is more

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
levels are simply goofing off is more
enjoyable<00:02:43.760> than<00:02:44.060> any<00:02:44.330> other<00:02:44.510> Mario<00:02:44.780> game

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
enjoyable than any other Mario game

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.870 
enjoyable than any other Mario game
because<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.860> new<00:02:46.010> gravity<00:02:46.340> effects<00:02:46.670> and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
because of the new gravity effects and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.520 
because of the new gravity effects and
also<00:02:47.270> because<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.750> way<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.290> traverse

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
also because the way you can traverse

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.590 
also because the way you can traverse
levels<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.340> run<00:02:49.490> upside<00:02:49.820> down<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.480> can

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
levels you can run upside down you can

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.210 
levels you can run upside down you can
run<00:02:50.780> right<00:02:51.140> side<00:02:51.350> up<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.710> can<00:02:51.860> jump<00:02:52.070> off

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
run right side up and you can jump off

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.460 
run right side up and you can jump off
ledges<00:02:52.490> at<00:02:53.120> which<00:02:53.240> point<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.690> hell<00:02:54.200> breaks

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470

loose<00:02:54.650> gravity<00:02:55.100> was<00:02:55.280> part<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.240> appeal

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
loose gravity was part of the appeal

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.810 
loose gravity was part of the appeal
then<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.170> experiment<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:58.190> simply<00:02:58.580> try

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
then is to experiment to simply try

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760 
then is to experiment to simply try
things<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.240> see<00:02:59.450> what<00:02:59.570> happens<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.740> example

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
things and see what happens for example

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.500 
things and see what happens for example
watch<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.580> happens<00:03:01.880> when<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.030> jump<00:03:02.240> off<00:03:02.330> this

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
watch what happens when I jump off this

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.470 
watch what happens when I jump off this
tower

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.759 

I<00:03:10.909> had<00:03:11.909> two<00:03:12.090> fears<00:03:12.390> going<00:03:12.569> in<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> galaxy<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
I had two fears going in the galaxy the

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.080 
I had two fears going in the galaxy the
first<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.220> all<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.580> levels<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> game

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
first is that all the levels in the game

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
first is that all the levels in the game
would<00:03:15.360> look<00:03:15.510> pretty<00:03:15.840> much<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.230> same<00:03:16.409> clean<00:03:17.069> to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
would look pretty much the same clean to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.619 
would look pretty much the same clean to
a<00:03:17.220> space<00:03:17.519> motif<00:03:17.909> in<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.150> same<00:03:18.360> way<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
a space motif in the same way that

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.649 
a space motif in the same way that
sunshine<00:03:18.930> clunk<00:03:19.409> to<00:03:19.530> an<00:03:19.650> island<00:03:19.830> motif<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
sunshine clunk to an island motif and

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.910 
sunshine clunk to an island motif and
second<00:03:21.659> that<00:03:21.840> Mario<00:03:22.200> would<00:03:22.319> only<00:03:22.500> traverse

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
second that Mario would only traverse

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.190 
second that Mario would only traverse
small<00:03:23.310> planets<00:03:23.819> never<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.480> exploring<00:03:24.900> or

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
small planets never really exploring or

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.710 
small planets never really exploring or
