00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 good guys welcome in all video 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.750
 of gt5 like here we are back with 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.750
 subscribers 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.650
 Youtube 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.790
 soil 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 we are 14 people and you have to catch as 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.619
 species of the perfect head thank you 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.250
 sir I love you too or if there is a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.079
 kind of weird stuff that I do not break uncle 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 the world pride or whatever it is called 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.390
 educational center I think it's a bad 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 site to listen to there by god 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.440
 holy what good madness let's try 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.440
 to win obviously we are from people but 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.539
 if the beasts of the subscribers 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.080
 do not look at the least for me 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.740
 as I gave myself to also generated the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.750
 obviously world 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.409
 if people get out of roses but I 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 I'm an old woman 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.020
 and last time 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:29.590
 no other cars in the middle of you or anything 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.290
 better than if one gets to catch me 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.350
 it seems a bit complicated 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.340
 let's go to my goal is not to be low 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.510
 aesthetic was going to leave there way free 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.820
 hours when there is a free path 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.420
 thing first active bera bera bera attentive 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.800
 is eye eye eye eye eye eye eye 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.830
 eye 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.570
 tell me your study is worth I think if 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.310
 was the word 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.200
 good to be used proven equal 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.460
 ok let's go rooms suddenly you know the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 habits and so they leave me if you do not touch me 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 Wait waiting next one is worth 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.580
 brake and it happens now whose shipment I have spent 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.200
 between two cars but to the limit 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.759
 as a fourth to finish before the third 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.890
 obviously I will not have the third 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.320
 back because if it would not be the fifth one very 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.540
 good good statements says goodbye well 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.459
 We're going to put the pool in case I'm still 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
 like that something past is already clear the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.120
 double because he thinks it's the taste I was not going 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.410
 to be transferable and he has beaten me 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.480
 I have in front of the third guys at 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.920
 500 of the mini map is not so far either 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.910
 and the second one is because neither very 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.470
 far 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.970
 it's two laps so pretty, but 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.540
 because the car flies so much giant uncle 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.010
 having bottom left pardon 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.630
 recoil has requested us I do not know 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.820
 who have studied or is it a 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.710
 very big madness guys we also keep 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.120
 the third quarter so often 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.830
 there is a little work there in the world 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.710
 networks and I have a little bit of luck and 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.690
 and as the first he did not give not know 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.130
 what I can not think of anything but like 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.320
 first it is showing we are going ahead 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.320
 on the right of the right going on 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.989
 it was my chance to put my second 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.489
 I think I live but I passed very bad uncle 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.360
 mother will see let's go let's go let's go 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.260
 rebujito we will not do a braking and a 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.580
 a little bit that there's a 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.580
 concept a little bit 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:36.540
 stability because he is not a king of 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:41.220
 this normal the last back flip before 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.430
 get to the rhythm the eggs was not 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.829
 put compadre 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.000
 the pride of you popular lately 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.159
 I was playing the races almost without 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.540
 nobody but now people are the sandwich 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.540
 but very weird 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.159
 normal 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.870
 overtake on the right but so 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.000
 risky that my mother what is 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.000
 going on and off and he parked like that 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:28.759
 in first person 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:32.229
 what guys will you tell me because if the 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.229
 building is 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.500
 this way this this advance not us 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.500
 advanced to stop it a bit 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.610
 it's like I already totally control uncle 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.870
 the key does not have anyone behind I have 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.550
 nobody is really worth nothing appears 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.050
 behind perfect right now but I 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.669
 let's do a little bit let's do 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.960
 a little bit for these people to pass 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.460
 perfect, perfect, we have a way 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.710
 Free guys we have free road 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.610
 we have free road let's go let's go 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.229
 we go 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.510
 we take this well I will not get to that 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.610
 it's not that clear, in the end I 'm going to 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.110
 catch a lot of speed I have to play 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.669
 look, I do not know, I have to accelerate from here 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.660
 I have to step up and pass him that 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.550
 God want because as it offers a 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.380
 little before arriving, he did not even arrive 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.729
 coÃ±a gave now burton all point 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.930
 complicated because I have from the previous 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:24.210
 area 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.470
 but this starts to get a little complicated 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.350
 because we are here the 14 people 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.570
 nobody is passing it and we are all a 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.290
 so overwhelmed but what nobody knows 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:41.790
 is that I'm going to spend 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:45.070
 below man and if nobody yet 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.500
 it is very complicated this is worth going 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.750
 come on let's go call me give away we're going very 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.280
 well we win very well we go too 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.190
 okay guys it's not the small and the medium 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.070
 Oh my God 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.230

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.450
 nobody else and I stayed a little bit for 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.450
 fuck 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.060
 a very pretty race very cool to the 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.890
 races and with more people as they catch more 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.230
 vidilla is much cooler so 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.850
 Well, here you can leave the 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.650
