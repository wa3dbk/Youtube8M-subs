00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.690
 good people today we are going to make a 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.960
 tutorial to generate eating and good I'll 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.769
 to explain how the general is done with 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.270
 the automates first of all this is the 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.390
 general eating worth 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.039
 as we see here 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.539
 would give him break the young man and we 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:33.290
 would generate this circuit as younger 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:36.940
 With the stand, well, we deliver it 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.720
 and we see that it is creating 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.720
 how are you doing now 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.370
 how this is done is very easy 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.090
 First you have to go here 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.840
 make a lever that activates the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.270
 mechanism as we see here and this is a 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.059
 mechanism of a clock 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 this is what it does 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.030
 send electrical impulses all the time 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 as we see here that is sending here and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 activates the piston every time the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.259
 impellers then we see that it is created 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.259
 every two for three 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.320
 why 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.810
 do not go to the cob later 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.880
 we have put an oven here as we see 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.820
 here 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.690
 and good this is the mechanism and tupi 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.870
 you're here all the time 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.630
 and it would take until the cover of this that you 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.600
 give the win 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.930
 and we have put there a target and forward 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.720
 so that it does not destroy it to the limit 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.520
 easily on the wall so power 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.679
 explain everything you want by giving it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.030
 there to the same address and taking 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.880
 all the blocks as finished 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.440
 good we stopped the mechanism and I teach you 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.440
 how do you make a clock of these 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.410
 to make the clock you have to do this 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.410
 picture 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.900
 and we put here the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.830
 the repeaters these 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.000
 amplifiers would then turn that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.250
 circuit like that but of course here it does not go through 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 what 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.210
 there is no very good rest when we activate 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.870
 makes a move the piston and what it does is 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.080
 the impulse this goes through here through 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.300
 of the stone and keep moving forward 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.110
 then we see that this lamp receives 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.690
 impulses every X time 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.440
 you can do this faster or more 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.100
 slow 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.090
 that modifying the times that are here 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.090
 as I will do now 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.710
 and we see that it goes faster 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.050
 You can also make several sizes 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.380
 can make this smaller so that 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.070
 go to more 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.280
 faster and does not pass through two repeaters 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.920
 those or even bigger for me to go 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.510
 slower and you can measure then the time 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.510
 they do putting it 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.610
 good 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.980
 the system of this position you activate it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.020
 this normally has a 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.740
 the torch would be on 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.170
 how are we going to see 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.940
 and it is so that it starts sending the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:50.000
 impulses if it were off then 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.959
 the whole circuit would be off 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.069
 I would make a clock or nothing in as there is no 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.770
 a spark as who says then not 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.590
 this mechanism would work and this block 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.970
 so that the circuit goes and here to 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.760
 turn off this and on the contrary 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.250
 good to make covers manually 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.590
 then you would have to take the bucket 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.760
 water you have to make these two little holes 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.550
 that we see here because if it would not hit 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.600
 the lava that we are going to put and would be created 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.870
 Obsidian instead of eating and clear 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.020
 we will only create a block and the lava 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.020
 would disappear well we put here the water 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.460
 OK 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.520
 we see here that it is as free and here 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.280
 we put lava 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.639
 and now it is created and the young woman as you peek 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.639
 arias 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.580
 and there we have the cover 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.310
 because we do it automated because if 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.760
 we go here and we are wrong and we 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.990
 we are with the lava badly we go then 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.920
 then we make a mechanism like this 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.350
 automated 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.630
 that when I turn it on, do not go 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.639
 to burn because it is quite far from the 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.810
 mechanism 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:22.560
 and you can take everything you want 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.020
 well this is how we have seen 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.470
 in the example above 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.740
 this pushes the piston forward all 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.990
 not for this is the clock we have 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.480
 fact 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.730
 this is a line to know what is 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.230
 turned on the mechanism of this lamp and 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.650
 talk 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.200
 to pay lit and here doing the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.960
 clock that passes so that the impulses and 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.610
 the piston age 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.720
 here you will have a general cover 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.720
 automatic stone 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:01.789
 and good I hope you liked the 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:05.559
 subscribe video and come to the 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.559
 next tutorial come
