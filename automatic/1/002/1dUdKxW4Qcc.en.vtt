00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
the corsets this is not too surprising

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.479 
the corsets this is not too surprising
as<00:03:44.349> these<00:03:44.500> cards<00:03:44.739> are<00:03:44.829> really<00:03:45.010> easy<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.340> get<00:03:45.430> a

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
lined up like this since we get to look

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.830 
lined up like this since we get to look
at<00:03:50.889> cards<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.519> aren't<00:03:52.030> really<00:03:52.389> considered
