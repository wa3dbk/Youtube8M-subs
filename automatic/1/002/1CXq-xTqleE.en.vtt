so<00:00:07.410> we're<00:00:07.649> at<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> lutheran<00:00:08.220> university<00:00:08.820> soon

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
so we're at the lutheran university soon

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.570 
so we're at the lutheran university soon
call<00:00:09.929> at<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> moment<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.679> we're<00:00:11.160> doing<00:00:11.370> some

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
call at the moment and we're doing some

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.060 
call at the moment and we're doing some
testing<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.320> Andy<00:00:13.320> he's<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> guy<00:00:13.830> swimming

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
testing with Andy he's the guy swimming

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550 
testing with Andy he's the guy swimming
in<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> background<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.059> some<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.929> his<00:00:16.139> other

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:32.620 
training partners looking out there
starts<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.680> turns<00:00:19.980> performance

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.330 

swimming<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> quite<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.470> traditional<00:00:35.040> sport

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
swimming is quite a traditional sport

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.410 
swimming is quite a traditional sport
there's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.090> lot<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> reliance<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.140> cameras<00:00:38.420> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
there's a lot of reliance on cameras and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.170 
there's a lot of reliance on cameras and
manual<00:00:40.020> methods<00:00:40.610> stopwatches<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:42.000> what

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
manual methods stopwatches that's what

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.260 
manual methods stopwatches that's what
all<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> coaches<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.760> there<00:00:44.760> isn't<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
all the coaches have and there isn't a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990 
all the coaches have and there isn't a
massive<00:00:45.780> uptake<00:00:46.380> of<00:00:46.670> more<00:00:47.670> complex

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
massive uptake of more complex

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240 
massive uptake of more complex
technologies<00:00:48.900> what<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.650> were<00:00:49.739> trying<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.040> do

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
technologies what we were trying to do

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.020 
technologies what we were trying to do
is<00:00:50.520> implement<00:00:51.530> novel<00:00:52.530> technologies<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
is implement novel technologies to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.390 
is implement novel technologies to
monitor<00:00:54.510> stuff<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:55.020> quantitatively<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
monitor stuff more quantitatively so

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.910 
monitor stuff more quantitatively so
they<00:00:56.670> could<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.030> records<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.920> understand

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
they could keep records and understand

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
they could keep records and understand
how<00:00:59.280> athletes<00:00:59.970> are<00:01:00.210> progressing<00:01:00.870> we're

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
how athletes are progressing we're

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.010 
how athletes are progressing we're
mostly<00:01:01.980> focus<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.580> skills<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.629> they're

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
mostly focus on the skills so they're

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.410 
mostly focus on the skills so they're
starts<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> turns<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.430> our<00:01:05.640> predominant

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
starts and that turns is our predominant

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
starts and that turns is our predominant
focus<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.800> give<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:08.130> few<00:01:08.369> extra

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
focus if we can give them a few extra

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.930 
focus if we can give them a few extra
numbers<00:01:09.509> that<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.440> can<00:01:10.740> better<00:01:11.430> understand

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
numbers that they can better understand

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.999 
numbers that they can better understand
the<00:01:12.030> performance<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:13.020> regulation<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
the performance the regulation is that

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.590 
the performance the regulation is that
you<00:01:14.280> must<00:01:14.550> break<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.850> surface<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> water

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you must break the surface of the water

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
you must break the surface of the water
within<00:01:16.020> 15<00:01:16.410> meters<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.250> also<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> significant

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
within 15 meters it's also a significant

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.330 
within 15 meters it's also a significant
part<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.290> length<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
part of the the length and that is the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.219 
part of the the length and that is the
fastest<00:01:20.850> part<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:21.930> advantage

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
fastest part so you can get an advantage

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.950 
fastest part so you can get an advantage
on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> start<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.130> definitely<00:01:23.850> where<00:01:24.780> as

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
on the start that's definitely where as

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
on the start that's definitely where as
some<00:01:25.590> guys<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.979> 1500<00:01:26.640> meters<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> start<00:01:27.330> is

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
some guys do 1500 meters the start is

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
some guys do 1500 meters the start is
not<00:01:27.690> very<00:01:27.869> important<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.410> they<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.649> lots<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
not very important but they do lots and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
not very important but they do lots and
lots<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.550> turns<00:01:29.850> during<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.479> time<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.050> if<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
lots of turns during that time so if you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.499 
lots of turns during that time so if you
can<00:01:31.470> shave<00:01:31.800> tiny<00:01:32.430> amounts<00:01:32.910> of<00:01:33.030> time<00:01:33.210> from

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
can shave tiny amounts of time from

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.990 
can shave tiny amounts of time from
every<00:01:33.869> turn<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:35.130> yeah<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.580> can<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
every turn then yeah you can make a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.690 
every turn then yeah you can make a
massive<00:01:36.300> difference<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.810> overall<00:01:37.170> times

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
massive difference to overall times

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
massive difference to overall times
we've<00:01:38.700> been<00:01:38.729> getting<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.569> three

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we've been getting them to do three

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350 
we've been getting them to do three
maximal<00:01:40.950> starts<00:01:41.459> and<00:01:41.640> three<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:41.940> more<00:01:42.149> turns

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
maximal starts and three much more turns

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.050 
maximal starts and three much more turns
each<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:43.319> we've<00:01:43.500> got<00:01:43.709> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.429> wall<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
each what we've got on the wall is a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.350 
each what we've got on the wall is a
thin-film<00:01:45.929> pressure<00:01:46.560> pad<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:47.009> we've

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
thin-film pressure pad that we've

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.820 
thin-film pressure pad that we've
encapsulated<00:01:48.360> filling<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.990> waterproof<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
encapsulated filling it's waterproof and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.160 
encapsulated filling it's waterproof and
so<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> looks<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> swimmers<00:01:51.390> we

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so it looks right for the swimmers we

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.919 
so it looks right for the swimmers we
get<00:01:52.440> real-time<00:01:52.860> capture<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:54.060> their<00:01:54.630> pressure

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
get real-time capture of their pressure

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.370 
get real-time capture of their pressure
during<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.130> tumble<00:01:56.459> turn<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> things<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.630> ask

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
during the tumble turn and things we ask

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.650 
during the tumble turn and things we ask
the<00:01:58.530> same<00:01:58.740> from<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.429> their<00:02:00.179> depth<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
the same from this is their depth of

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.230 
the same from this is their depth of
their<00:02:01.319> there's<00:02:01.830> both<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.369> their<00:02:02.490> feet<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
their there's both of their feet the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.449 
their there's both of their feet the
orientation<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.990> their<00:02:04.200> feet<00:02:04.440> how<00:02:05.190> long

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
orientation of their feet how long

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.100 
orientation of their feet how long
they're<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> wall<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.420> also<00:02:06.840> pressure

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
they're on the wall and also pressure

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
they're on the wall and also pressure
information<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.220> derive

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
information from which we can derive

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880 
information from which we can derive
their<00:02:08.849> course<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.690> look<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:10.020> their

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
their course so we can look at their

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.309 
their course so we can look at their
technique<00:02:11.849> without<00:02:12.270> relying<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.870> cameras

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
technique without relying on cameras

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.140 
technique without relying on cameras
there<00:02:13.800> are<00:02:13.980> different<00:02:14.520> schools<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> thought
