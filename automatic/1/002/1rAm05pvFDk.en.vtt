this thing up past 100 miles an hour but

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.710 
this thing up past 100 miles an hour but
this<00:01:07.259> stock<00:01:07.530> plate<00:01:07.829> it<00:01:08.009> should<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.670> 90<00:01:09.030> we

this stock plate it should do over 90 we
have<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> speed<00:01:10.649> gun<00:01:10.890> set<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> test<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
have a speed gun set up just to test the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
have a speed gun set up just to test the
speed<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:12.930> sure<00:01:13.079> that<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.649> up

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
speed to make sure that we can get up

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.889 
speed to make sure that we can get up
over<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.969> cooler<00:01:15.149> features<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
over that some of the cooler features of

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.910 
over that some of the cooler features of
this<00:01:16.049> plane<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:17.009> has<00:01:17.750> flaps<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.620> can<00:01:19.740> land

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this plane it has flaps so you can land

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
this plane it has flaps so you can land
it<00:01:20.100> nice<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.310> slow<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.450> they're<00:01:22.020> timed<00:01:22.320> flaps

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it nice and slow and they're timed flaps

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.820 
it nice and slow and they're timed flaps
so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:23.970> need<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.420> worry<00:01:24.659> about<00:01:24.830> setting

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so you don't need to worry about setting

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.789 
so you don't need to worry about setting
up<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.130> rates<00:01:26.430> inside<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.120> your<00:01:27.799> controller

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
up any rates inside of your controller

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.120 
up any rates inside of your controller
you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> dx6i<00:01:30.650> no<00:01:31.650> problem

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you can do it with the dx6i no problem

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.100 
you can do it with the dx6i no problem
even<00:01:32.340> though<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> can't<00:01:32.790> set<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.299> slow<00:01:33.750> rate

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
even though you can't set up a slow rate

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.130 
even though you can't set up a slow rate
for<00:01:34.500> hill<00:01:35.430> runs<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.180> guy<00:01:36.360> has<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> sequencer

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
for hill runs this guy has a sequencer

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.270 
for hill runs this guy has a sequencer
in<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.440> also<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.549> has

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
in it also it has

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.820 
in it also it has
spinning<00:01:39.820> back<00:01:39.850> landing<00:01:40.690> gear<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.320> these<00:01:41.650> are

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
spinning back landing gear and these are

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.280 
spinning back landing gear and these are
on<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:41.950> sequence<00:01:42.430> also<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:46.330> they<00:01:46.450> spin<00:01:46.690> back<00:01:46.990> and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
on a sequence also so they spin back and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.980 
on a sequence also so they spin back and
put<00:01:47.470> in<00:01:47.590> get<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.190> place<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:49.150> I'm<00:01:49.479> not<00:01:49.720> too

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
put in get in place now I'm not too

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.680 
put in get in place now I'm not too
thrilled<00:01:50.020> with<00:01:50.710> how<00:01:50.890> fast<00:01:51.310> those<00:01:51.729> go<00:01:52.000> in<00:01:52.210> I'd

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
thrilled with how fast those go in I'd

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.840 
thrilled with how fast those go in I'd
really<00:01:53.020> like<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.440> be<00:01:53.590> more<00:01:53.830> scale<00:01:54.310> feeling

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
really like it to be more scale feeling

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.180 
really like it to be more scale feeling
but<00:01:55.540> you<00:01:55.810> know<00:01:55.930> what<00:01:56.170> I'm<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.860> happy<00:01:57.159> it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
but you know what I'm just happy it's

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.680 
but you know what I'm just happy it's
retracts<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.940> I'm<00:01:58.000> happy<00:01:58.240> they<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:58.509> in<00:01:58.600> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
retracts and I'm happy they go in the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.300 
retracts and I'm happy they go in the
right<00:01:58.869> way<00:01:59.050> instead<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.440> going<00:01:59.619> out<00:01:59.890> along<00:02:00.159> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
right way instead of going out along the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.770 
right way instead of going out along the
wings<00:02:00.520> like<00:02:01.180> some<00:02:01.390> course<00:02:01.600> series<00:02:01.899> you<00:02:01.990> see<00:02:02.460> so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
wings like some course series you see so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.480 
wings like some course series you see so
take<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> while<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.649> then<00:02:06.159> they<00:02:06.280> come<00:02:06.460> out

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
take a while and then they come out

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.820 
take a while and then they come out
another<00:02:07.060> thing<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.540> don't<00:02:07.780> particularly<00:02:08.560> care

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830

another thing I don't particularly care
for<00:02:09.069> is<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.910> landing<00:02:10.239> gear<00:02:10.479> for<00:02:10.959> some<00:02:11.200> reason

for is the landing gear for some reason
have<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.709> an<00:02:11.980> enormous<00:02:12.790> amount<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.209> bounce<00:02:13.390> when

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
have a an enormous amount of bounce when

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.210 
have a an enormous amount of bounce when
you're<00:02:13.900> taxiing<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.709> runway

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
you're taxiing on the runway

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.250 
you're taxiing on the runway
the<00:02:15.519> thing<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.850> flipping<00:02:16.239> all<00:02:16.330> over<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> place

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the thing is flipping all over the place

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.800 
the thing is flipping all over the place
other<00:02:17.739> than<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.100> though<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.970> plane<00:02:19.360> flies

amazingly<00:02:20.709> let's<00:02:21.310> get<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.580> up<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.910> air<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
amazingly let's get it up in the air and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:03:10.970 
amazingly let's get it up in the air and
see<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.050> she<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.230> do

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.740 

as<00:03:11.980> we<00:03:12.220> got<00:03:12.340> 84<00:03:12.970> miles<00:03:13.180> an<00:03:13.420> hour<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.690> that's

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
as we got 84 miles an hour and that's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.290 
as we got 84 miles an hour and that's
even<00:03:14.140> with<00:03:14.320> maybe<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.190> two<00:03:15.490> or<00:03:15.700> three<00:03:15.910> mile<00:03:16.090> an

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
even with maybe a two or three mile an

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.810 
even with maybe a two or three mile an
hour<00:03:16.360> tailwind<00:03:16.990> so<00:03:17.620> that's<00:03:17.740> not<00:03:17.920> quite<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.250> 90

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
hour tailwind so that's not quite the 90

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.640 
hour tailwind so that's not quite the 90
promise<00:03:19.270> my<00:03:19.450> guess<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.900> when<00:03:20.080> they<00:03:20.200> said<00:03:20.410> 90

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
promise my guess is when they said 90

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.870 
promise my guess is when they said 90
miles<00:03:20.830> an<00:03:20.950> hour<00:03:21.070> they<00:03:21.280> meant<00:03:21.490> like<00:03:21.670> with<00:03:21.850> a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
miles an hour they meant like with a

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.390 
miles an hour they meant like with a
slight<00:03:22.210> dive<00:03:22.570> when<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.410> do<00:03:23.530> my<00:03:23.770> speed<00:03:24.040> tests

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
slight dive when I do my speed tests

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.250 
slight dive when I do my speed tests
they're<00:03:24.520> perfectly<00:03:24.940> level<00:03:25.420> by<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.810> time<00:03:25.930> they

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
they're perfectly level by the time they

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.650 
they're perfectly level by the time they
get<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.560> range<00:03:26.770> of<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.070> radar<00:03:27.400> gun<00:03:27.580> so<00:03:28.270> there

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
get in range of the radar gun so there

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.480 
get in range of the radar gun so there
you<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.900> about<00:03:29.170> 84<00:03:29.770> miles<00:03:29.980> an<00:03:30.160> hour<00:03:30.310> that

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
you have it about 84 miles an hour that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.600 
you have it about 84 miles an hour that
puts<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:31.000> about<00:03:31.290> 5<00:03:32.290> 6<00:03:32.620> miles<00:03:32.890> an<00:03:33.100> hour<00:03:33.220> faster

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
puts it about 5 6 miles an hour faster

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.210 
puts it about 5 6 miles an hour faster
than<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.210> striker<00:03:34.630> which<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.440> considerably

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
than a striker which is considerably

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.910 
than a striker which is considerably
fast<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.970> about<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> same<00:03:38.170> size<00:03:38.470> as<00:03:38.770> this

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
fast and about the same size as this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.690 
fast and about the same size as this
plane<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:39.970> screamingly<00:03:40.780> fast<00:03:41.200> plane

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
plane so it is a screamingly fast plane

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
plane so it is a screamingly fast plane
I'm<00:03:42.700> going<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.910> take<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.210> up<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.570> some

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
I'm going to take it up do some

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.750 
I'm going to take it up do some
aerobatics<00:03:44.230> with<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.530> see<00:03:44.830> how<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.070> goes<00:03:45.250> but

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
aerobatics with it see how it goes but

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.130 
aerobatics with it see how it goes but
there<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.030> have<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.570> Tiger<00:03:46.900> honest

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
there you have it this is Tiger honest

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.880 
there you have it this is Tiger honest
for<00:03:47.290> test<00:03:47.470> pilot<00:03:47.770> RC<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:49.390> was<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:50.050> rock
