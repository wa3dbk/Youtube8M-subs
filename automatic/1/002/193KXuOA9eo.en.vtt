00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.600
 i 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.609
 hello all welcome one more day 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.949
 today I come to talk about the maxi des of 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.110
 the long dresses I think with this 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.559
 heat does not feel like stopping to look 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.050
 in front of the closet and that we put on 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.540
 I think the long dress is a garment 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.460
 great for this time of year and that 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.350
 it can be worth us for any 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.360
 event during the day good as I have 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.610
 said I think we can take it so much 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.040
 for the day as for the night for the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.489
 day we can wear the dress more 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.729
 more casual sports roll with a shopper 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.269
 and some sandals for example instead 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.549
 Well, for the night we can get 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.119
 metal accessories or a portfolio of 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:06.460
 hand or wedges some sandals 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.100
 heel depending on the dress 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.000
 we can vary and make it look 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.070
 more more arranged in my case for example 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.590
 the touch that I like the most 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.680
 dress is to put a leather belt 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.350
 twisted in the waist guys now step 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.840
 to show you three dresses my favorites 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.179
 from now on I have others but now 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.829
 I taught you last summer I think so 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.320
 I wanted to base on these three that 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.990
 are the most recent I hope that you 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.770
 enjoy that you have taken some idea that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.020
 you cheer up because they are super cool to me 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.079
 I love how they look, I think they are very 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.369
 feminine and that you continue to enjoy 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.369
