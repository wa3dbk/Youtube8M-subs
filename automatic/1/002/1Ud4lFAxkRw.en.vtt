wah<00:00:49.970> by<00:00:50.090> Ibanez<00:00:50.600> it's<00:00:50.900> basically<00:00:51.710> up<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.160> specs

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
wah by Ibanez it's basically up to specs

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240 
wah by Ibanez it's basically up to specs
of<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.270> original<00:00:53.750> version<00:00:54.650> except<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.070> has<00:00:55.220> a

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
of the original version except it has a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.500 
of the original version except it has a
really<00:00:55.730> rugged<00:00:56.560> steel<00:00:57.560> casing<00:00:58.070> on<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.370> we<00:00:59.330> also

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
really rugged steel casing on it we also

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.720 
really rugged steel casing on it we also
the<00:00:59.870> very<00:01:00.050> cool<00:01:00.230> thing<00:01:00.380> about<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.800> wah<00:01:01.430> is

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
the very cool thing about this wah is

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.570 
the very cool thing about this wah is
that<00:01:02.270> it's<00:01:02.420> an<00:01:02.510> op-amp<00:01:02.960> circuit<00:01:03.620> so<00:01:04.250> basically

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
that it's an op-amp circuit so basically

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.160 
that it's an op-amp circuit so basically
it's<00:01:04.790> more<00:01:05.000> clear<00:01:05.240> than<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.480> inductor<00:01:05.990> wise

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
it's more clear than the inductor wise

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.820 
it's more clear than the inductor wise
there's<00:01:07.130> no<00:01:07.340> volume<00:01:07.580> drop<00:01:08.230> which<00:01:09.230> makes<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.710> to

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
there's no volume drop which makes it to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.580 
there's no volume drop which makes it to
me<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.100> very<00:01:10.160> clean<00:01:10.670> sounding<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.380> same

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
me it's very clean sounding in the same

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.710 
me it's very clean sounding in the same
sense<00:01:12.890> there's<00:01:13.370> a<00:01:13.460> depth<00:01:13.700> knob<00:01:13.910> on<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
sense there's a depth knob on it and the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.870 
sense there's a depth knob on it and the
depth<00:01:14.960> knob<00:01:15.140> if<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:16.010> see<00:01:16.190> on<00:01:16.310> here<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.670> could

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
depth knob if you see on here you could

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.870 
depth knob if you see on here you could
you<00:01:17.150> could<00:01:17.300> actually<00:01:17.540> turn<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.200> up<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.610> it

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
you could actually turn it up and it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.450 
you could actually turn it up and it
increases<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.510> wah<00:01:20.660> sound<00:01:21.160> just<00:01:22.160> give<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.400> a

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
increases the wah sound just give you a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.790 
increases the wah sound just give you a
little<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:26.780> great<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.200> dirty<00:01:27.440> sound

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
little and it's great for a dirty sound

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.719 
little and it's great for a dirty sound
as<00:01:27.979> well<00:01:28.160> and<00:01:29.800> on<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.950> dirty<00:01:31.160> sound<00:01:31.490> that

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
as well and on the dirty sound that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.090 
as well and on the dirty sound that
actually<00:01:32.240> pushes<00:01:32.540> your<00:01:33.410> tubes<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:33.950> gives

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
actually pushes your tubes and it gives

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.440 
actually pushes your tubes and it gives
you<00:01:34.160> some<00:01:34.369> more<00:01:34.550> distortion<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.180> I'm<00:01:35.270> going<00:01:35.420> to

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
you some more distortion so I'm going to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.840 
you some more distortion so I'm going to
show<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.690> that<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.200> last<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.100> not<00:01:37.250> least<00:01:37.550> it

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
show you that and last but not least it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.120 
show you that and last but not least it
has<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.030> guitar<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.540> bass<00:01:38.720> switch<00:01:39.320> on<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.770> let

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
has a guitar and bass switch on it let

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.100 
has a guitar and bass switch on it let
me<00:01:40.220> just<00:01:40.369> show<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:40.970> quick<00:01:44.110> and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
me just show you that really quick and

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.020 
me just show you that really quick and
here's<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.100> bass

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.980 

so<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.990> really<00:01:54.320> makes<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.650> tone<00:01:55.720> vaisya<00:01:56.720> which

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
so it really makes the tone vaisya which

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.060 
so it really makes the tone vaisya which
is<00:01:57.110> great<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.440> it<00:01:57.530> doesn't<00:01:57.770> mean<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.890> could

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
is great and it doesn't mean you could

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.410 
is great and it doesn't mean you could
have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.250> use<00:01:58.370> that<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.550> bass<00:01:58.820> guitar<00:01:59.210> plays

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
have to use that for bass guitar plays

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.750 
have to use that for bass guitar plays
could<00:01:59.600> experiment<00:01:59.960> with<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:00.830> well<00:02:00.980> so

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
could experiment with it as well so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.010 
could experiment with it as well so
let's<00:02:01.970> check<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.300> out<00:02:02.390> let's<00:02:02.570> check<00:02:02.780> out<00:02:02.900> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
let's check it out let's check out the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.960 
let's check it out let's check out the
dirty<00:02:03.230> sound<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.860> I'm<00:02:04.430> going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.610> turn<00:02:04.820> the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
dirty sound and I'm going to turn the

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.220 
dirty sound and I'm going to turn the
depth<00:02:05.180> up<00:02:05.300> make<00:02:05.480> sure<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:05.840> up<00:02:05.990> there

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
depth up make sure that it's up there

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:39.210 
depth up make sure that it's up there
and<00:02:06.710> I'll<00:02:07.040> show<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.220> what<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.490> sounds<00:02:07.730> like
