00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and today I'm going to show you how easy

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.360 
and today I'm going to show you how easy
it<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.640> make<00:00:05.790> your<00:00:05.940> own<00:00:06.210> pancake<00:00:07.109> syrup<00:00:07.440> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
it is to make your own pancake syrup the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.060 
it is to make your own pancake syrup the
first<00:00:08.610> thing<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.940> need<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> do<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.870> get<00:00:10.769> some

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
first thing you need to do is get some

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.640 
first thing you need to do is get some
water<00:00:11.340> boiling<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.450> use<00:00:12.780> two<00:00:13.110> cups<00:00:13.440> of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
water boiling and I use two cups of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.810 
water boiling and I use two cups of
water<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.370> get<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> boiling<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.340> also<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
water and get that boiling and also you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.590 
water and get that boiling and also you
I<00:00:18.029> say<00:00:18.840> these<00:00:19.730> syrup<00:00:20.730> containers<00:00:21.359> from<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
I say these syrup containers from the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200 
I say these syrup containers from the
store<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.340> were<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.760> syrup<00:00:23.970> cools

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
store so when they were the syrup cools

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.370 
store so when they were the syrup cools
I'm<00:00:24.359> quarter<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.019> kids<00:00:25.199> never

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'm quarter there and the kids never

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.400 
I'm quarter there and the kids never
know<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> difference<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.970> anyway<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
know the difference but anyway the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.410 
know the difference but anyway the
circuit<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.099> make<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.460> not<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.760> thick<00:00:30.060> as

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
circuit that we make is not as thick as

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
circuit that we make is not as thick as
a<00:00:30.449> Jemima<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.320> anything<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a Jemima or anything like that if you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.740 
a Jemima or anything like that if you
want<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.790> thicker<00:00:33.030> instead<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> using

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
want it to be thicker instead of using

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.709 
want it to be thicker instead of using
sugar<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> show<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> today

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
sugar which I'm going to show you today

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
sugar which I'm going to show you today
you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:36.960> part<00:00:37.770> sugar<00:00:38.070> part<00:00:38.399> corn<00:00:38.640> syrup

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you can use part sugar part corn syrup

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.410 
you can use part sugar part corn syrup
and<00:00:39.210> honey<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> sugar

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and honey or we just go with the sugar

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
and honey or we just go with the sugar
and<00:00:42.629> water<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.379> thick<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and water and it's not as thick as the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
and water and it's not as thick as the
store-bought<00:00:44.250> thourough<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:44.940> kids<00:00:45.149> love

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
store-bought thourough but my kids love

water boiling and you're going to use
twice<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> amount<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.690> sugar<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> have

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
twice the amount of sugar as you have

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610 
twice the amount of sugar as you have
water<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.399> four<00:00:54.390> cups<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> sugar<00:00:54.930> basically

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that to boil for women and now I'm going

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
that to boil for women and now I'm going
to<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.140> half<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> teaspoon<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.040> vanilla

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
flavoring and a quarter of a teaspoon of
vanilla<00:01:18.600> gives<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.439> extra<00:01:19.680> flavor

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
vanilla gives it a little extra flavor

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.660 
vanilla gives it a little extra flavor
so<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.700> good

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.210 

remember<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.760> you<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.330> thicker

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
remember if you want it to be thicker

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
remember if you want it to be thicker
you're<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:30.230> like<00:01:31.230> half<00:01:31.260> sugar<00:01:31.710> half

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're going to use like half sugar half

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.020 
you're going to use like half sugar half
corn<00:01:32.190> syrup<00:01:32.490> okay<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.310> it's<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.670> cooking

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
corn syrup okay so it's like a cooking

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.920 
corn syrup okay so it's like a cooking
show<00:01:36.270> isn't<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> water<00:01:39.210> spoiling<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
show isn't it so the water spoiling you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.220 
show isn't it so the water spoiling you
put<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.650> sugar<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.080> you're<00:01:43.080> going

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
put this the sugar in and you're going

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.960 
put this the sugar in and you're going
to<00:01:43.290> start<00:01:43.590> let<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.980> boil<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.400> about<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.730> minute

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to start let it boil for about a minute

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.100 
to start let it boil for about a minute
and<00:01:45.240> let<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.720> water<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.320> boil<00:01:46.560> down<00:01:46.970> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
and let the water kind of boil down and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.360 
and let the water kind of boil down and
you<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> put<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.770> flavoring<00:01:50.250> in

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
you don't want to put the flavoring in

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.820 
you don't want to put the flavoring in
until<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> very<00:01:50.820> end<00:01:51.770> because<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:55.440> will<00:01:55.650> cook

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
until the very end because it will cook

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.770 
until the very end because it will cook
off<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.580> want<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.300> wait<00:01:57.420> till<00:01:57.690> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
off so you want to just wait till the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.120 
off so you want to just wait till the

to sit here for one whole minute while
it<00:02:27.360> boils<00:02:27.480> away<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:28.950> 2<00:02:29.370> cups<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.760> water<00:02:29.940> 4
