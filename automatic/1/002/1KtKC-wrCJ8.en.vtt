00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.779
 one of the requests made to me 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.630
 more frequently it is to prepare 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.490
 a nice birthday cake and I'd say 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.439
 which is a challenge that I gladly accept 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.170
 because anyway a gift made with the 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.180
 own hands is always a welcome gift 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 this cake is a cake that starts from 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.440
 German tradition is that I had to 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.330
 rework a little I did several 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.890
 rework and what is me 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.320
 liked the most is the one I made 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.210
 for consistency a ludovica friend who is 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.010
 intolerant to gluten and that has me 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.260
 asked to make her a special cake for 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.180
 his five years today I want to prepare 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.400
 a slightly more adult version with 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.739
 cocoa and sour cherries but the dough is 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.989
 the same to prepare it without gluten 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.210
 just replace the flour with one 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.070
 Special gluten-free flour others 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 the ingredients are cocoa and 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.080
 chocolate the blacksmiths a bit of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.430
 cream sugar and eggs 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.619
 since it is a bit of a cake 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.380
 complex and that I generally have to do 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.780
 at least a day better two days before 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.490
 starting from the dough I prepare everyone 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.009
 the ingredients so then you can 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.009
 work faster than cocoa 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 then 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.440
 missing eggs 6 making a big cake 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.950
 so let's say for about 12 people one 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.400
 24 30 cm mold is better 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.660
 use the mixer because you should 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.730
 otherwise install really long now 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.350
 while he mounts the wall in farino lo 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.650
 mold that I will need to cook mine 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.650
 cake 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.490
 now I need a split and the cake is 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.380
 almost ready to go into the oven reforms 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.380
 at 180 degrees already in temperature 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.280
 it is essential to work well with the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.900
 spatula also on the bottom of the bowl 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.580
 where you usually always find some 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.650
 cocoa some flour that have not been 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.780
 blended it's time to go inside it 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.780
 mold and then from the mold to the oven 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.920
 thirty minutes of cooking and then another 30 minutes 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:44.030
 to make it cool on the grill e 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.980
 finally it will be ready to fill it in 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.319
 meanwhile I carry on preparing the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.090
 cream also in this case if you want 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.489
 prepare the cream without gluten 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.420
 just replace the normal flour 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.420
 with rice flour 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.560
 this is really one of the troops that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.560
 I prefer 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:18.159
 the milk is almost warm now a little 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.159
 flour 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.060
 60 grams for a base 4 eggs 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.070
 this is the result you need to get 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:37.830
 milk a few minutes of cooking and also 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.400
 the cream is ready to prepare a little 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.260
 advance 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.780
 not so much because I want to put it 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.850
 inside the cold cake but why 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.130
 I want to insert the cherries when the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.650
 first the two flavors are still warm 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.180
 they will blend perfectly and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.180
 the cherries will be inside the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.600
 chocolate as a soft surprise 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.460
 tasty with every bite you will eventually see is 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.070
 much easier than you can 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.420
 to think 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.650
 here is the cream right now 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.170
 consistency 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.680
 cooling then it will thicken again 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.480
 a little more 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.430
 it's time to turn off the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.430
 flame and add the chocolate 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.030
 once the chocolate is 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.980
 completely mixed add half 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.900
 of cherries inside the cream e 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.930
 I keep the other half aside 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.820
 for the cake those that go into the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.330
 cream should be well drained e 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.330
 from the syrup 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.250
 I would say a couple more 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.450
 perfect while the cream cools down 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.860
 I'm just going to see where it is 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.960
 once the cake is very cold 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.440
 the time comes to cut the half e 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.310
 make them there you can decide to do two or three 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.570
 layers to use a bread knife 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.310
 and engrave slowly but decisively 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.080
 you can do it directly on the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.570
 Latin where you decided to serve the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.330
 cake so the base will remain already 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.330
 placed gently 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.360
 very well then at this point 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.789
 I begin with the cherries I cover with the 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.050
 cream a layer of other marine cake 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:37.199
 I use another cream instead 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:45.449
 syrup to slightly moisten too 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:47.550
 the base the cream must be warm as well 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.259
 that it will be easier to spread it all over 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.720
 the cake evenly but 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.569
 above all it will enter the dough and 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.740
 this will go the very simple cake that 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.740
 really very good 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.640
 this time over walls I will finish the 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.640
 jar 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.630
 and now the lid 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:26.330
 if there are lower areas 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.900
 you can try to add a marina in 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.930
 so that the dough tends to be raised to 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.819
 this point I advise you to wrap 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.770
 the cake with some film and put them 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.509
 in the refrigerator all night e 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.690
 the time has come to cover the 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:44.110
 cake with whipped cream and then with 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.110
 berries 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.900
 I still like the surface not 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.940
 be too regular also because not 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.800
 being a pastry chef you will never be in 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.340
 able to do it like mine do 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.470
 Colleagues 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.640
 the last thing missing is the decoration 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.640
 final with fresh fruit 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:31.660
 and then the last finishing touch also 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.490
 some black cherry above in this case 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.950
 I prefer to drain them from theirs 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:42.060
 high syrup positioning now is 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.060
 really perfect
