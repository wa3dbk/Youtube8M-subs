I'm demonstrating on this video how to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.600 
I'm demonstrating on this video how to
do<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.119> quickest<00:01:21.600> way<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.610> wasn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
do it this is the quickest way I wasn't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
do it this is the quickest way I wasn't
saying<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.390> using<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.689> hot<00:01:24.869> glue<00:01:24.900> gun

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
saying I I'm using a hot glue gun

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
saying I I'm using a hot glue gun
and<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.430> could<00:01:26.610> try<00:01:26.880> using<00:01:26.939> staplers<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and you could try using staplers you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
and you could try using staplers you
don't<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> hot<00:01:28.619> glue<00:01:28.770> gun<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.759> use<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
don't have a hot glue gun you can use a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.870 
don't have a hot glue gun you can use a
ordinary<00:01:31.020> glue<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
ordinary glue but you do have to kind of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.630 
ordinary glue but you do have to kind of
hold<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.930> place<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.220> sets

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
hold it in place a little bit as it sets

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.330 
hold it in place a little bit as it sets
so<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.479> really<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.110> little<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> trial<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so it's really a little bit of trial and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690 
so it's really a little bit of trial and
error<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.000> terms<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:40.040> finding<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.460> works

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
error in terms of finding out what works

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
error in terms of finding out what works
best<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> say<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> like

definitely need you to help you buy

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
definitely need you to help you buy
everything<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
everything so this is going to be that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.179 
everything so this is going to be that
the<00:01:53.220> cut<00:01:53.659> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> saucer

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
the cut this is going to be the saucer

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.499 
the cut this is going to be the saucer
and<00:01:58.189> also<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.549> saw<00:01:58.789> on<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.939> other<00:01:59.119> ones<00:01:59.359> that

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
and also you saw on the other ones that

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.090 
and also you saw on the other ones that
could<00:01:59.659> show<00:01:59.840> they<00:02:00.020> had<00:02:00.140> like<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.350> wiggly<00:02:00.890> line

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
could show they had like a wiggly line

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.310 
could show they had like a wiggly line
so<00:02:01.579> I'm<00:02:01.700> doing<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:02.149> simply<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.109> know<00:02:03.170> you

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
so I'm doing it simply and you know you

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.100 
so I'm doing it simply and you know you
can<00:02:03.469> add<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:03.829> wiggly<00:02:04.219> line<00:02:04.429> for<00:02:04.820> detail<00:02:05.210> but

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
can add this wiggly line for detail but

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.749 
can add this wiggly line for detail but
again<00:02:06.439> that<00:02:06.649> takes<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.100> bit<00:02:07.219> longer<00:02:07.250> than<00:02:07.549> to

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
again that takes a bit longer than to

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.339 
again that takes a bit longer than to
cut<00:02:07.939> help<00:02:08.209> if<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.599> have<00:02:08.720> for<00:02:08.810> example<00:02:08.840> cutting

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
cut help if you have for example cutting

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.440 
cut help if you have for example cutting
machines<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.610> know<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.759> could<00:02:10.910> crickets<00:02:11.300> or

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
machines you know I could crickets or

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.240 
machines you know I could crickets or
something<00:02:11.780> similar<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.410> could<00:02:12.890> just<00:02:13.069> lose

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
something similar you could just lose

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.610 
something similar you could just lose
the<00:02:13.400> pattern<00:02:13.819> into<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.180> cricket<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.959> newer

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
the pattern into the cricket the newer

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.770 
the pattern into the cricket the newer
ones<00:02:15.860> let<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.280> load<00:02:16.430> your<00:02:16.640> own<00:02:16.790> patterns<00:02:17.180> by

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
ones let you load your own patterns by

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.800 
ones let you load your own patterns by
my<00:02:18.170> pattern<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:20.000> know<00:02:20.480> then<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.690> can

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
my pattern and you know then you can

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.380 
my pattern and you know then you can
just<00:02:20.930> cut<00:02:21.620> them<00:02:21.830> really<00:02:22.580> quickly<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.239> easily

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
just cut them really quickly and easily

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.380 
just cut them really quickly and easily
without<00:02:24.319> having<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.700> add<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:25.879> those<00:02:26.060> do<00:02:26.239> so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
without having to add all those do so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.539 
without having to add all those do so
you<00:02:26.480> could<00:02:26.599> even<00:02:26.720> put<00:02:26.930> some<00:02:26.989> lace<00:02:27.379> effect<00:02:27.890> on

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
you could even put some lace effect on

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.660 
you could even put some lace effect on
them<00:02:28.790> which<00:02:28.940> would<00:02:29.030> be<00:02:29.150> really<00:02:29.329> nice<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.670> so

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
them which would be really nice in it so

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.740 
them which would be really nice in it so
taking<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.540> while<00:02:33.079> here<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:35.150> cut<00:02:35.720> out

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
taking a while here and then cut out

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.550 
taking a while here and then cut out
this<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:37.360> bet<00:02:38.360> you're<00:02:38.480> thinking<00:02:38.510> why<00:02:39.110> don't<00:02:39.170> you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
this I bet you're thinking why don't you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.770 
this I bet you're thinking why don't you
cut<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:39.950> out<00:02:40.010> beforehand<00:02:40.880> well<00:02:41.329> I<00:02:41.569> think

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
cut that out beforehand well I think

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.740 
cut that out beforehand well I think
it's<00:02:42.049> nice<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.440> show<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.400> at<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.579> base<00:02:43.760> how

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's nice to show so at the base how

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's nice to show so at the base how
each<00:02:45.019> bit<00:02:45.349> comes<00:02:45.920> along<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.239> bit

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
each bit comes along so now this bit

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.380 
each bit comes along so now this bit
here<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.819> connected<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:50.150> almost<00:02:50.269> like

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
here is connected it so it's almost like

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.600 
here is connected it so it's almost like
you're<00:02:50.599> connecting<00:02:51.140> piece<00:02:51.410> or<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
you're connecting piece or it's the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.580 
you're connecting piece or it's the
bottom<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.060> teacup<00:02:53.959> depending<00:02:54.349> on<00:02:54.440> how

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
bottom of the teacup depending on how

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.559 
bottom of the teacup depending on how
you<00:02:54.650> look<00:02:54.950> at<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.220> if<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> want<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.940> you

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
you look at it and if you want it to you

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.119 
you look at it and if you want it to you
could<00:02:56.780> actually<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:57.170> kick<00:02:57.739> this<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
could actually just kick this to the

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.699 
could actually just kick this to the
teacup<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.879> have<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.629> base<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.379> teacup

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
teacup and have the base and the teacup

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.110 
teacup and have the base and the teacup
separately<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.310> then<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.549> probably<00:03:01.760> would

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
separately but then you probably would

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.390 
separately but then you probably would
need<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.389> cut<00:03:02.569> another<00:03:02.780> one<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.079> these<00:03:03.400> yellows

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
need to cut another one of these yellows

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400 
need to cut another one of these yellows
out<00:03:04.609> so<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:04.970> your<00:03:05.090> saucer<00:03:05.989> doesn't<00:03:06.260> have<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
out so that your saucer doesn't have a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.460 
out so that your saucer doesn't have a
hole<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:07.190> makes<00:03:07.340> sense<00:03:07.670> now<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.209> one<00:03:08.510> he

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
hole that makes sense now this one he

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.580 
hole that makes sense now this one he
also<00:03:09.620> need<00:03:09.829> to<00:03:09.920> cut<00:03:10.130> these<00:03:10.940> strips<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:12.470> to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
also need to cut these strips just to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.559 
also need to cut these strips just to
the<00:03:12.680> middle<00:03:12.769> just<00:03:13.519> sorry<00:03:13.819> not<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.359> middle

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
paper and that's all normal glue does

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.060 
paper and that's all normal glue does
work<00:05:29.150> you<00:05:29.570> just<00:05:29.780> means<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.110> need<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.290> hold<00:05:30.620> you

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
so example if you're using normal glue

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.040 
so example if you're using normal glue
I'll<00:05:34.699> probably<00:05:35.060> pop<00:05:35.270> clothes<00:05:35.479> peg<00:05:35.750> here<00:05:35.990> in

I'll probably pop clothes peg here in

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.230 
I'll probably pop clothes peg here in
here<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.410> let<00:05:36.560> it<00:05:36.650> dry

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
here and let it dry

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.580
