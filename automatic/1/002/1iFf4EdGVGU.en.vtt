00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
if it's extremely busy so I decided to

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.050

my 24 to 70 lens and I had a light panel

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.399

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
if I needed it for the low-light so I

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.779 
if I needed it for the low-light so I
really<00:01:19.770> expected<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.310> place<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
in a lot of light use some high I

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.870 
in a lot of light use some high I
associate<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> 2.8<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.369> prepared

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
associate a 2.8 so I was going prepared

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.889 
associate a 2.8 so I was going prepared
once<00:01:27.119> again<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.509> why<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> brought<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
once again that's why I brought the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.570 
once again that's why I brought the
monopod<00:01:28.289> so<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.039> some<00:01:29.159> things<00:01:29.399> that<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
monopod so there are some things that I

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.859 
monopod so there are some things that I

mind<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.770> guess<00:02:05.009> some<00:02:05.219> places<00:02:05.460> well<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
mind I guess some places well but when I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.160 
mind I guess some places well but when I
went<00:02:06.299> into<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.450> Convention<00:02:06.869> Center<00:02:07.079> in

went into the Convention Center in

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.749 
went into the Convention Center in
Philly<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.130> Philadelphia<00:02:08.640> Pennsylvania

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
Philly and Philadelphia Pennsylvania

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.669 
Philly and Philadelphia Pennsylvania
they<00:02:09.329> didn't<00:02:09.630> allow<00:02:09.810> me<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.019> bring<00:02:10.109> my<00:02:10.170> monopod

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
they didn't allow me to bring my monopod

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.560 
they didn't allow me to bring my monopod
so<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:11.340> why<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.549> know<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.359> bit<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
so that's why you know a little bit of

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.539 
so that's why you know a little bit of
shaky<00:02:12.810> video<00:02:13.019> because<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.410> all<00:02:13.560> handheld<00:02:13.890> so

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
shaky video because it's all handheld so

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.440 
shaky video because it's all handheld so
that's<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.760> something<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.060> got<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.180> keep<00:02:15.299> in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.610 
that's just something you got to keep in
mind<00:02:15.600> something<00:02:15.780> got<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:15.989> keep<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.290> counter

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
mind something got to keep in counter

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.170

out<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.959> images<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.829> huge

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
out in the images but one of the huge

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.660 
out in the images but one of the huge
things<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.459> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
things is that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.660 
things is that
it<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.000> lower<00:02:51.209> light<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> was<00:02:52.080> using<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.670> 640

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
it is lower light so I was using a 640

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.870 
it is lower light so I was using a 640
ISO<00:02:54.209> with<00:02:54.480> my<00:02:54.830> d7000<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.520> was<00:02:56.610> shooting

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
ISO with my d7000 I think I was shooting

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.670 
ISO with my d7000 I think I was shooting
at<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.569> sixteenth<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.260> second

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
at really like a sixteenth of a second

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.620 
at really like a sixteenth of a second
for<00:02:59.010> photography<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
for photography so I was really on the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.300 
for photography so I was really on the
low<00:03:00.780> end<00:03:00.810> because<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.709> wanted<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.980> keep<00:03:02.130> out

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
low end because I wanted to keep out

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.620 
low end because I wanted to keep out
lower<00:03:02.550> shutter<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.150> wanted<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> keep<00:03:03.480> it

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
lower shutter I just wanted to keep it

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
lower shutter I just wanted to keep it
around<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.319> without<00:03:04.920> risking<00:03:05.370> yeah<00:03:05.520> you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
like that so I was doing that but for

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.820 
like that so I was doing that but for
video<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.780> was<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.020> thirtieth<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> second

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
video I was a thirtieth of a second

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.930 
video I was a thirtieth of a second
because<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.069> was<00:03:11.190> leading<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.520> wanted<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.790> light

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
because I was leading I wanted to light

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.059 
because I was leading I wanted to light
in<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.180> lot<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> light<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:13.680> know<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:13.890> still

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
in a lot of light you know it's still

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.590 
in a lot of light you know it's still
maintaining<00:03:14.489> ISO<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.209> when<00:03:15.360> he<00:03:15.450> goes

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
maintaining ISO because when he goes

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.270 
maintaining ISO because when he goes
above<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> thousand<00:03:16.380> sixteen<00:03:16.680> hundred<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.130> me<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
above a thousand sixteen hundred to me I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.070 
above a thousand sixteen hundred to me I
don't<00:03:17.550> like<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.819> use<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.600> doesn't<00:03:18.930> look

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
don't like to use that it doesn't look

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.690 
don't like to use that it doesn't look
go<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> d7000<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.310> was<00:03:20.430> trying<00:03:20.670> to

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
go with the d7000 so I was trying to

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.729 
go with the d7000 so I was trying to
keep<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:20.880> quality<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:21.989> its<00:03:22.200> maximum

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
keep the quality to you know its maximum

keep the quality to you know its maximum
in<00:03:22.890> my<00:03:23.040> opinion<00:03:23.400> when<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.580> go<00:03:23.700> into<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.940> car

could<00:05:16.979> have<00:05:17.039> got<00:05:17.189> some<00:05:17.340> really<00:05:17.580> great<00:05:17.669> stuff

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
could have got some really great stuff

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.189 
could have got some really great stuff
but<00:05:18.479> then<00:05:18.569> there<00:05:18.659> were<00:05:18.719> stuff<00:05:18.900> where<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> was

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
but then there were stuff where I was

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.959 
but then there were stuff where I was
cropped<00:05:19.439> because<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.860> couldn't<00:05:20.219> get<00:05:20.370> back<00:05:20.639> far

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.489 
cropped because I couldn't get back far
enough<00:05:20.999> because<00:05:21.870> there<00:05:21.990> was<00:05:22.110> people<00:05:22.259> there<00:05:22.469> I

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:22.499 
enough because there was people there I

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:23.659

assumed<00:05:22.949> there<00:05:23.039> was<00:05:23.099> gonna<00:05:23.219> be<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.430> other<00:05:23.520> way

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
assumed there was gonna be the other way

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.860 
assumed there was gonna be the other way
around<00:05:23.699> where<00:05:24.150> I<00:05:24.180> needed<00:05:24.389> some<00:05:24.569> more<00:05:24.689> reach

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
