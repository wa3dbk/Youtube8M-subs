00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.210
 a reliable outdoor detector a crucial first line of defense 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.269
 However, for conventional display detectors, the environment 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.269
 presents a major obstacle a passing cloud 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.690
 a bed a chair a pet is all that is needed to shoot 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.489
 the alarm 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.069
 a false alarm 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.390
 it is finished we present your piggy bank or 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.430
 a series of detectors for outdoors and to propose 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.470
 Cocha Oct has the selective ability to identify specific events 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.640
 differentiating accurately between the events that trigger a false alarm and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 the actual instructions 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.970
 this is possible through two microwave channels the innovative technology of 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.150
 recognition of light situations 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.620
 measure the distance of the approaching targets and carlos tevez 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.460
 the targets that move distance limited instantly 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.890
 they stop being considered real intrusion events 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.740
 even more hugo chÃ¡vez's digital correlation technology is based on 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.060
 the comparison of signals coming from two independent pierre channels 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 guaranteeing that only the targets that emit a similar signal 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 in both channels are classified as possible threats 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.210
 this eliminates false alarms caused by domestic animals which 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.409
 Due to their size they can not be simultaneously on both channels 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.780
 similarly, two events that generate signals that are not correlated 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.690
 each other and is discarded as well as sudden changes in temperature 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 caused by gusts of wind and clouds 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.110
 In addition to its exclusive technological advantages, the flexibility of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.460
 installation of hugo chÃ¡vez 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.049
 the option of incorporating a camera the increase of outstanding 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.710
 security features and ability to offer diagnostics to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.030
 distance make it the ideal choice for external protection more 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.130
 trustworthy 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.690
 however unpredictable the environment 8 guarantees differentiation 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.729
 reliability between the events that cause a false alarm and the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.550
 real intrusions 8 closed with ed here begins to dignified external protection 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.920
 of trust
