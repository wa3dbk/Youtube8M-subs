from<00:00:30.960> British<00:00:31.230> stock<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:31.830> from<00:00:31.949> British

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
from British stock here so from British

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.490 
from British stock here so from British
websites<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.969> mean<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.899> could<00:00:34.050> get<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.380> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
websites I mean you could get that in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.959 
websites I mean you could get that in
the<00:00:34.590> US<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.130> something<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.730> don't<00:00:35.850> really

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the US but something we don't really

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.080 
the US but something we don't really
like<00:00:36.239> buying<00:00:36.570> things<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.469> far<00:00:37.920> away<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:41.090> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
like buying things from far away and so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
like buying things from far away and so
I<00:00:42.120> thought<00:00:42.360> it'd<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.510> good<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> add<00:00:42.870> her

I thought it'd be good to add her

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.900 
I thought it'd be good to add her
because<00:00:43.440> she<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.950> review<00:00:44.340> stuff<00:00:44.640> which

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
