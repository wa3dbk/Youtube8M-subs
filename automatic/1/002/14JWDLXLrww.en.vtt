00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.080
 Christmas is coming and many people 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.759
 he wants to lose those little books 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.350
 our guest today doctor john 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.000
 ribera tells us about two new 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 acetone natural supplements 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.960
 raspberry and green coffee extract 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.340
 who claim to be very effective in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 battle against overweight how are you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.999
 hello how are we thank you welcome 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.679
 nation to see tell me why the coffee 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.210
 green that is the coffee warning is the 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.509
 raw coffee fresh from the bush 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.189
 the green coffee before it burns 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.470
 because it has an antioxidant that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.659
 called chlorogenic acid 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.780
 that what it turns out to do is that 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.879
 decreases the absorption of fat and sugar 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.590
 at the level of the intestine and therefore the 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.399
 people lose weight there is a study 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.739
 omar that was done for 16 weeks where 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.460
 the people who took this product 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.050
 Green coffee extract lost about 16 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.430
 pounds 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.989
 and why coffee does not work anymore 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.220
 processed normally that we take daily 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the same way what happens is that 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.410
 when the grain burns loses that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.449
 antioxidant that low chlorogenic acid 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 very well now for example in the case of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.190
 the raspberry acetone is true that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.140
 it also helps to lose weight what is known 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.420
 in English as the raspberry quito 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 or the acetone of the raspberry 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 it definitely helps what it does is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 which increases a hormone in the body sea 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.619
 which is called adiponectin which is the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 hormone that makes our body 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.500
 burn fat more effectively the dose 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.119
 are 100 milligrams a day of acetone 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 of raspberry to see I do not know of dose 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 but I imagine this is for season 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.800
 to begin what we get this 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.539
 How many fruit would we have to eat to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.300
 can achieve that dose for example 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.310
 too many we would have to eat so much and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.770
 so much raspberry that it would be impossible 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.450
 get those 100 milligrams that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 we needed to increase that hormone 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.860
 that will help us burn more fat 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.740
 efficiently and that's why it's 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.360
 buy the supplement and in the case of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.940
 green coffee how can we also measure 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.440
 that effect because I see that comes 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.000
 concentrated but when we would have to 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.730
 take in proportion so to speak 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.510
 in terms of the extract 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.360
 of green coffee are 400 milligrams three 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.880
 times a day 30 minutes before each 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.980
 breakfast lunch lunch and dinner is 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.530
 very important that when they go to 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.590
 get it they have to have so 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.950
 minus 45 percent chlorogenic acid 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.080
 and in the ingredients you should say and if it is 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.660
 which means green confiante 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.890
 occident or another antioxidant that 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.300
 beto called SVT or is is natural that 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.950
 is so they can buy the one that 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.140
 it really works because they are going to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.180
 find a lot more something very 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.620
 important that I want to clarify and I do not 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.210
 selling these products had not been 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.190
 Affiliated with any of the other wines 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.070
 only so I recommend them because 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.740
 I understand that they work together with a 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.720
 diet and exercise obviously we can not 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.390
 go eating for example pizzas and 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.160
 burgers every day thinking that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.570
 these two supplements are going to help us 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.950
 lose weight what good option I understand 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.080
 that this coffee diet wanted it ice and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.210
 under all that was 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.680
 awesome thank you very much for being 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.810
 earrings I already have several are there 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.310
 noting the data true later 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.430
 including you do not become more 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.430
 ahead
