00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.189
 Y 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.559
 today roll fashion bloggers we are going to 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.789
 talk about outfits of this outfit 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.250
 very beautiful of how 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.949
 Make up this cute bag of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.750
 the death of photography the selfish not 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.520
 is obviously going to talk about 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.040
 photography that yes and of cameras of a 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.840
 very curious very special and for which 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.880
 the fis indeed the happy ones the fish 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.200
 it seems that they are very important we are going to 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.180
 talk about this camera here in the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.180
 new samsung nx100 and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.489
 the in x mini as his own name 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.510
 lets guess is the little sister 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.579
 of the family 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.129
 nx from samsung that is from the cameras 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.110
 with interchangeable optics and without a mirror 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.210
 what has changed since the sensor 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.969
 follow the normal nx we have a sensor 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.370
 ap st in this case we have one more topic 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.809
 small one inch and 20 megapixels 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.159
 remember that one inch is a size 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.079
 that is becoming popular 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.250
 first in optical cameras 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.019
 interchangeable the psni with one by 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.670
 example they use this same size but 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.469
 also in compact cameras like 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.469
 example sony christing 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.190
 then some smaller sensor is us 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
 that we have a camera really very 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.690
 compact compact to carry in the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 pocket to carry it always over 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.740
 also the smallest tensor is going to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.020
 allow to use very small targets very 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 minutes set in this 9 mm efe 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 35 which is roughly equivalent to an angular 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.670
 of 24 millimeters there is also not what 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.950
 We have now here but there is a zoom 9 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.050
 27 millimeters that is something like the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.880
 standard zoom for this system remember 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.740
 By the way, we are talking about a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.720
 new system with a new mount like this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 that if we want to use objectives 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.430
 nx of our samsung cameras we are going to 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.780
 have to resort to an adapter that yes 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.100
 it's going to be a little unbalanced 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.930
 because the optics are quite large 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.740
 and as we said the body is really 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.740
 very small 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.560
 although the truth is that it is not a camera 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.060
 to get complicated in the action to life 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.410
 is a camera designed for users who 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.330
 they will work mostly in automatic 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.620
 and they want good results so 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.720
 very simple in case someone has 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.400
 curiosity the in x-men and effectively 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.440
 you have with all manuals you have extras and 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.510
 with priorities and so on we can also 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.430
 shoot in robots and attentive to the 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 speed because the burst is 6 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.910
 frames per second and apart has a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.430
 electronic shutter mode that can 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.079
 reach up to 16,000 seconds 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.489
 quick on the shot we've already said 6 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.659
 frames per second and we also 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.920
 you are very pleasantly offering the 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.099
 Focus system speed 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.099
 automatic 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.940
 we do it from technical rolls because 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.260
 we said that the in x mini is a 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.450
 camera designed to work in 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.790
 automatic to not complicate us and about 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.560
 everything to make us feel pleasure the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.420
 self-portraits you already know that is so 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.830
 fashionable and with what samsung since 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.750
 He triumphed so much with that self and the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.840
 oscar is a bit obsessed we have 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.880
 an articulated screen that rotates 180 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 degrees that moves 180 degrees and that of 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.180
 done only with this move and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.980
 we activate the camera we activate the camera 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.820
 we start it and activate the mode 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.820
 self-portrait 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.760
 since you are fed up with the end 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.440
 we also but possibly there 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.000
 many things that you still do not know about 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.800
 We are going to make a small master's 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.080
 feel for example the self and it's 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.640
 self-portrait but if for example not 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.890
 we take out a celtic drunk all a 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.080
 classic would be called delphi by 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.210
 example another option to take out a self and 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.160
 of the hair is called the fit but as 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.440
 you will understand in this case it is a little 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.110
 complicated there is also gel fish if not 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.060
 we took a picture of the ass would be helfy 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.260
 and the neckline that has no name but 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.970
 we are going to save both 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.560
 last lesson of this master the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.390
 selfish so then you know the ready ones 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.890
 if you do a self-portrait in which 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.300
 not only leave you but leave 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.670
 someone else like for example the photo 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.810
 let's go to that of the oscar is not a 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.810
 self and is a yes 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.550
 and this serves us as a sergio del culo 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.550
 of the end remember 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.190
 i 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.630
 Y 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.759
 in x well and of course it also has 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.680
 wi-fi connection in fact has up to a 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.479
 dedicated button to manage the 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.580
 connections is also accompanied by 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.680
 nfc with which if we have a mobile that 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.229
 have nfc connection like for example this 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.569
 new samsung blue everything stays at home 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.550
 samsung samsung will be enough to bring them closer 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.749
 to connect they link and 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.960
 we can control the camera from the 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.960
 mobile 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.350
 They are not an expert in being both in 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.510
 all battle fronts and is in 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.910
 x-men and it 's the proof of it we had 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.310
 compact shared in their big nx 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.590
 with sensor to psc mobiles with cameras 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.990
 quite powerful the galaxy camera and by 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.430
 if something was missing now we have this nx 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.610
 mini with a one-inch sensor of what 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.720
 we said and 20 megapixels the truth 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.700
 is that it does not contribute much to what 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.200
 we had in the in the digital showcase 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.820
 and the fact that the goal can be 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.250
 exchange for the type of user that 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.110
 is directed is also not a big advantage 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.750
 but his favor must be recognized several 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.729
 things is small is very resultona is very 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.010
 fast the image quality is nothing 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.950
 wrong and the price is moderate very moderate 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.600
 costs between 400 450 euros and will cost more 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.860
 and it will cost 600 euros or us what 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.630
 we would pose but for this money 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.950
 we are willing to think about it 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.540
 meanwhile we will go practicing 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.979
 the cis because they put chicks 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.979
 I think it does not work out very well
