hi YouTube today I'm going to teach you
how<00:00:04.390> to<00:00:04.420> do<00:00:04.689> the<00:00:04.810> Sonic<00:00:05.170> which<00:00:05.770> is<00:00:05.920> basically

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
how to do the Sonic which is basically

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.449 
how to do the Sonic which is basically
this<00:00:07.590> spanning<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.680> pencil<00:00:09.010> from<00:00:09.100> your<00:00:09.280> ring

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:09.459 
this spanning the pencil from your ring

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.310 
this spanning the pencil from your ring
finger<00:00:09.730> and<00:00:09.880> middle<00:00:09.969> finger<00:00:10.120> to<00:00:10.780> your<00:00:10.900> middle

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
finger and middle finger to your middle

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.650 
finger and middle finger to your middle
finger<00:00:11.620> and<00:00:11.740> index<00:00:11.860> finger<00:00:12.340> so<00:00:13.240> first<00:00:13.480> things

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
finger and index finger so first things

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.329 
finger and index finger so first things
first<00:00:13.719> you're<00:00:14.049> going<00:00:14.170> to<00:00:14.230> need<00:00:14.290> a<00:00:14.380> unsharpened

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
first you're going to need a unsharpened

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:21.269 
first you're going to need a unsharpened
pencil<00:00:15.790> or<00:00:15.940> a<00:00:16.349> weighted<00:00:17.349> pen

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.470 

so<00:00:22.279> for<00:00:22.609> this<00:00:22.699> video<00:00:23.000> I'm<00:00:23.179> going<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.390> be

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
so for this video I'm going to be

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.830 
so for this video I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:24.169> the<00:00:24.320> sonic<00:00:24.949> with<00:00:25.099> this<00:00:25.279> pencil

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
demonstrating the sonic with this pencil

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.210 
demonstrating the sonic with this pencil
so<00:00:26.840> before<00:00:27.199> we<00:00:27.320> even<00:00:27.470> get<00:00:27.650> started<00:00:27.710> with<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
so before we even get started with the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.729 
so before we even get started with the
pencil<00:00:28.550> we<00:00:29.329> must<00:00:29.539> learn<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.899> basic<00:00:30.320> motion<00:00:30.649> of

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
pencil we must learn the basic motion of

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.330 
pencil we must learn the basic motion of
the<00:00:30.829> sonic<00:00:31.189> which<00:00:31.550> is<00:00:31.699> basically<00:00:32.059> this

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
the sonic which is basically this

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.439 
the sonic which is basically this
pushing<00:00:34.340> down<00:00:34.489> with<00:00:34.519> the<00:00:34.730> middle<00:00:34.969> finger<00:00:35.269> and

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
pushing down with the middle finger and

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.390 
pushing down with the middle finger and
closing<00:00:35.900> your<00:00:36.050> ring<00:00:36.379> finger<00:00:36.680> index<00:00:37.040> finger

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
closing your ring finger index finger

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.310 
closing your ring finger index finger
like<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.670> triangle<00:00:38.050> like<00:00:39.050> this

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.979 

so<00:00:42.320> get<00:00:43.190> used<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:43.820> you<00:00:44.570> can<00:00:44.720> think<00:00:44.930> of

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
so get used to it and you can think of

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.590 
so get used to it and you can think of
this<00:00:45.199> as<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.440> finger<00:00:46.070> exercise<00:00:46.579> or<00:00:46.940> something

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
this as a finger exercise or something

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.280 
this as a finger exercise or something
like<00:00:47.809> that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.310 

so<00:00:54.290> as<00:00:54.740> you<00:00:54.950> can<00:00:55.040> see<00:00:55.280> there<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.060> some<00:00:56.270> flab<00:00:56.989> or

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
so as you can see there is some flab or

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.960 
so as you can see there is some flab or
web<00:00:57.620> whatever<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.340> guys<00:00:58.430> want<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.700> call<00:00:58.880> it

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
web whatever you guys want to call it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.510 
web whatever you guys want to call it
between<00:00:59.210> my<00:00:59.390> thumb<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.900> index<00:01:00.320> finger<00:01:00.520> so

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
between my thumb and index finger so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.130 
between my thumb and index finger so
what<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.730> want<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:01.970> do<00:01:02.090> is<00:01:02.360> take<00:01:02.600> one<00:01:02.809> end<00:01:02.989> of

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
what you want to do is take one end of

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.380 
what you want to do is take one end of
the<00:01:03.230> pencil<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.830> place<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.820> by<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.089> flap

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
the pencil and place it just by the flap

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.880 
the pencil and place it just by the flap
like<00:01:06.050> this<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.520> other<00:01:07.700> end<00:01:07.940> between<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
like this and the other end between the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.890 
like this and the other end between the
middle<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.010> ring<00:01:10.220> finger<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:11.570> should<00:01:11.720> end

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
middle and ring finger so it should end

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.250 
middle and ring finger so it should end
up<00:01:11.990> looking<00:01:12.260> like<00:01:12.320> this

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.590 

so<00:01:17.260> now<00:01:17.440> what<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.710> want<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.070> guys<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.340> do<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.910> to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
so now what I want you guys to do is to

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.270 
so now what I want you guys to do is to
try<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> motion<00:01:20.260> that<00:01:20.410> I<00:01:20.440> taught<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.160> guys

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
try the motion that I taught you guys

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.890 
try the motion that I taught you guys
earlier<00:01:21.640> which<00:01:21.940> is<00:01:21.970> basically<00:01:22.480> pushing<00:01:22.780> down

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
earlier which is basically pushing down

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.240 
earlier which is basically pushing down
with<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.080> middle<00:01:23.230> finger<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.740> closing<00:01:24.130> like

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
with the middle finger and closing like

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.860 
with the middle finger and closing like
a<00:01:24.340> triangle<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.790> as<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.090> can<00:01:28.180> see<00:01:28.240> when<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.630> did

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
a triangle so as you can see when I did

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170 
a triangle so as you can see when I did
this<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.320> caught<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.650> pencil<00:01:30.040> by<00:01:30.160> itself<00:01:30.490> so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
this it caught the pencil by itself so

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.300 
this it caught the pencil by itself so
now<00:01:31.210> what<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.570> have<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.810> do<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.710> just<00:01:32.920> push<00:01:33.160> up

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
now what you have to do is just push up

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.700 
now what you have to do is just push up
with<00:01:33.430> your<00:01:33.550> middle<00:01:33.670> finger<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.120> that's<00:01:34.360> it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.800 

so<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:40.950> key<00:01:41.130> points<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.550> remember<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
so some key points to remember is that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.010 
so some key points to remember is that
you<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.229> want<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> end<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.070> pencil

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
you just want the end of this pencil

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.850 
you just want the end of this pencil
just<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> flag<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.560> when<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.650> push<00:01:49.830> down

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
just by the flag and when you push down

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.110 
just by the flag and when you push down
on<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.130> middle<00:01:50.310> finger<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
on the middle finger you just want to

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.120 
on the middle finger you just want to
put<00:01:51.330> enough<00:01:51.660> for<00:01:51.960> us<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.740> end<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
put enough for us to get this end of the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
put enough for us to get this end of the
pencil<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.940> web<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.360> flap<00:01:55.250> because<00:01:56.250> if

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
pencil out of the web or flap because if

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
pencil out of the web or flap because if
you<00:01:56.640> put<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.970> down<00:01:57.150> too<00:01:57.360> low<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.080> obviously

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you put it down too low you obviously

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
you put it down too low you obviously
can't<00:01:58.740> push<00:01:58.920> down<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.220> middle<00:01:59.490> finger

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
can't push down with the middle finger

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.359 
can't push down with the middle finger
and<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> pencil<00:02:00.420> can't<00:02:00.600> move<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.979> by<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and the pencil can't move so just by the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.630 
and the pencil can't move so just by the
end<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> pushed<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.400> middle

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
end so when I pushed out with the middle

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.400
