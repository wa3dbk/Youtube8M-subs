00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 it's personal global warming is a reality 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.530
 but it's good that there are people who are thinking of alternatives to 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.689
 to reverse what is happening, many of them work in companies that 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.259
 respect the environment and contributes to global warming decreases 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.829
 like faber-castell 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.189
 in fact since its foundation in 1761 it is a company that works in 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.900
 I am collaborating with the environment of society. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.760
 for example did you know that the factory to the end of the largest manufacturer of 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.290
 alarms 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.560
 from the reforested wood 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.890
 the faber-castell planting of the trees that give rise to the pencils without attacking the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 itself or cause waste 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 the wood is never taken from the native forests that in fact are recovered in 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.230
 natural reserve areas maintained by faperj castell 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.560
 it is not usual the screen has the fsc stamp 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.010
 the international institution that accredits environmentally 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.420
 in different countries 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.940
 where it has to be done by forests the socially just work 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.400
 of what sustained you may be wondering think so much this has to 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.280
 global warming is caused by too much 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.660
 called greenhouse houses 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.920
 one of the main ones is the amateur fisherman who solved the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.770
 Photosynthesis of trees 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.970
 only it has a detail growing young trees the most chapter 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.840
 carbon dioxide than that of adults 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.260
 to faber-castell all the areas cultivated in its maximum 25 years this 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 number is much greater than what is required for the protection of the south 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.210
 as a result of this work 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.090
 today faber-castell brasil neutralizes all charge riva 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.050
 but it is not only with the conscious industrial production of this aid that 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 reverse the effects of global warming 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.460
 when it comes to changing our reality 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.300
 well what an aberration 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.640
 this is why the plant is developing projects that protest 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.279
 recover native forests 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.359
 in the city of petulant silver mines' 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.729
 faber-castell has areas of tree planting used in the manufacture of 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.809
 preserving and restoring extensive areas of native forest 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:27.189
 the natural vegetation of the region is the cerrado because it is very simple and 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.349
 facilitates the occurrence of incidents as prevention 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.060
 the factory has seven research centers that mediocrity of art 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.699
 temperature the direction of the school 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.409
 later this Tuesday, these final tests 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.980
 in the direct confrontation, moreover, faber-castell may have been the consumption of 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.020
 electricity 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.039
 hated defeated 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.159
 how to recycle everything that is generated in your city 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.010
 agostina faber-castell 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 even the most difficult to use 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.580
 and also one of the great advantages of using 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.060
 wood for the production of slots is that there is no 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.240
 study products that are used in activities such as chicken farms 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.729
 industry may already decide factories at once 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.329
 that's why the sides of woods are better for nature than 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.769
 sides and plastic 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.130
 Did you know that the illicit in using red colored pencils 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.130
 I spent seven years to decompose in nature 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.409
 already in the case of plastic seals question 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.580
 made of work 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.540
 waste can remain in the environment because there are many 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.629
 years 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.560
 In addition, the energy used to produce plastic plates 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:43.549
 risk, which means much more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.809
 we have to keep our eyes open wide to choose what is best for Flemish 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:53.249
 and for more and more people to know how important issues are 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.769
 socio-environmental 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.769
 faber-castell develops the program well woman 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.089
 which promotes actions of local and global interest with the community, addressing the 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.769
 importance of respecting people and preserving our natural resources. 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.549
 who treats for example only in the first stage of the project felt a thousand people 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.609
 will be trained to teach the various 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.849
 ways of caring for the planet 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.309
 looks personal saw how a better world is possible 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.909
 the faber-castell is discarded the possibility of 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.680
 conquest of the Swiss city 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.949
 each day that passes more than 50% of the valid votes the security mixtape
