really important for the health of the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.759 
really important for the health of the
joint<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> energy<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.019> passing<00:00:10.500> through

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
joint that the energy is passing through

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.919 
joint that the energy is passing through
that<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> really<00:00:11.790> great<00:00:12.000> alignment<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
that with a really great alignment and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
that with a really great alignment and
ease<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> knee<00:00:15.179> we're<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
ease so for the knee we're just going to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.560 
ease so for the knee we're just going to
do<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> little<00:00:16.680> bit<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.039> rocking<00:00:17.490> motion<00:00:17.570> I'm

just<00:00:18.750> tapping<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.289> foot<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
just tapping my foot it's a really

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.810 
just tapping my foot it's a really
gentle<00:00:20.840> way<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> support<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> knee<00:00:23.130> joint<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
gentle way to support the knee joint and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
gentle way to support the knee joint and
to<00:00:24.119> loosen<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> joints<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.140> either<00:00:25.230> side

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to loosen up the joints on either side

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.679 
to loosen up the joints on either side
the<00:00:25.830> hip<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> ankle<00:00:29.300> I'm<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> place

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the hip and the ankle I'm going to place

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.990 
the hip and the ankle I'm going to place
both<00:00:30.960> hands<00:00:31.289> underneath<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> knee<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> just

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
both hands underneath the knee and just

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.459 
both hands underneath the knee and just
give<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> bounce<00:00:34.880> just<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
give a little bit of a bounce just to

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.130 
give a little bit of a bounce just to
again<00:00:37.469> support<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.850> joint<00:00:39.210> loosen<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
again support that joint loosen it up a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.889 
again support that joint loosen it up a
little<00:00:40.230> bit<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.210> extending<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
little bit and then with extending the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
little bit and then with extending the
whole<00:00:43.110> leg<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.620> bending<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.550> under<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
whole leg I'm bending right under that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.299 
whole leg I'm bending right under that
crease<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.840> placing<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.770> knee<00:00:46.829> there

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
crease and placing my knee there

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.580 
crease and placing my knee there
so<00:00:47.460> her<00:00:47.640> knee<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.149> supported<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.079> this

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so her knee is really supported and this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
so her knee is really supported and this
gives<00:00:49.829> me<00:00:49.980> access<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
gives me access to work on all of the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.330 
gives me access to work on all of the
energy<00:00:51.989> pathways<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.590> run<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> front

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
energy pathways that run up the front

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.990 
energy pathways that run up the front
inside<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.770> knee<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.160> well<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
inside of the knee as well as the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
inside of the knee as well as the
outside<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> leg<00:00:57.899> through<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
outside of the leg through the back of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.630 
outside of the leg through the back of
the<00:00:59.370> knee<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> there's<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> great<00:01:02.219> pressure

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the knee so there's a great pressure

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.990 
the knee so there's a great pressure
point<00:01:03.589> about<00:01:04.589> two<00:01:04.979> inches<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
point about two inches down from the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.770 
point about two inches down from the

knee on the outside of the shin bone
right<00:01:09.780> around<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:12.150> Japanese<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
right around here and in Japanese it's

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
right around here and in Japanese it's
called<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> she<00:01:14.760> sundry<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> English<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
called a she sundry and in English that

called a she sundry and in English that
means<00:01:16.259> three<00:01:16.740> mile<00:01:16.950> run<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> great

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
means three mile run this is a great

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.450 
means three mile run this is a great
point<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.600> runners<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.770> any<00:01:19.950> athletes

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
point for runners or really any athletes

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
point for runners or really any athletes
who<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.909> having<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.810> lot<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> stress<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
who are having a lot of stress on the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.950 
who are having a lot of stress on the
knee<00:01:22.890> helps<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> free<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.299> whole<00:01:24.659> area

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
knee helps to free up this whole area

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.100 
knee helps to free up this whole area
and<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> apply<00:01:26.909> quite<00:01:27.450> firm<00:01:27.810> pressure

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and you can apply quite firm pressure

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
and you can apply quite firm pressure
into<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> again<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.590> knees<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.369> it's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
into that so again the knees here it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.500 
into that so again the knees here it's
just<00:01:33.170> about<00:01:34.170> two<00:01:34.560> inches<00:01:35.100> down

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
just about two inches down

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.050 
just about two inches down
and<00:01:36.950> often<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> press<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.730> pressure

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and often when you press that pressure

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
and often when you press that pressure
point<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> feel<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.050> radiating<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.740> energy

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
point you can feel a radiating of energy

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.450 
point you can feel a radiating of energy
up<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.810> leg<00:01:43.020> which<00:01:43.830> helps<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
up and down the leg which helps to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
up and down the leg which helps to
remind<00:01:44.670> us<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.290> shiatsu<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.680> not

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
remind us that shiatsu is really not

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
remind us that shiatsu is really not
just<00:01:46.920> about<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:48.180> particular<00:01:48.750> part<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.080> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
just about one particular part of the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.110 
just about one particular part of the
body<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.830> about<00:01:50.100> connecting<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
body but it's about connecting and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.260 
body but it's about connecting and
integrating<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:52.050> really<00:01:52.800> great<00:01:53.220> alignment<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
integrating a really great alignment and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
integrating a really great alignment and
balance<00:01:54.660> throughout<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.050> whole<00:01:55.230> body

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.770 

so<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.250> balance<00:02:03.580> both<00:02:03.970> sides<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.540> knees

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so to balance both sides of the knees

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.660 
so to balance both sides of the knees
I'm<00:02:05.290> just<00:02:05.530> going<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.710> place<00:02:05.950> one<00:02:05.979> hand<00:02:06.430> on<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
I'm just going to place one hand on the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.449 
I'm just going to place one hand on the
in<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.210> one<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.630> out<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:09.099> send<00:02:09.340> an

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
in and one on the out and just send an

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.400 
in and one on the out and just send an
opposing<00:02:10.650> motion<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.800> energy<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.230> the
