let's<00:01:42.840> change<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> animation<00:01:43.500> style<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.640> fade

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
let's change the animation style to fade

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
let's change the animation style to fade
for<00:01:45.299> both<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.720> entry<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> exit<00:01:46.530> let<00:01:47.070> me

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
for both the entry and the exit let me

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
for both the entry and the exit let me
just<00:01:47.280> show<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.729> there<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> fade

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
just show you now there is a fade

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
just show you now there is a fade
animation<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> there's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.579> fade<00:01:50.759> out

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
animation and there's the fade out

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.060 
animation and there's the fade out
animation<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.600> these<00:01:51.810> animations<00:01:52.439> change<00:01:52.920> on

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
animation so these animations change on

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.219 
animation so these animations change on
the<00:01:53.159> fly<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.850> also<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.210> activation<00:01:54.750> method

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the fly you also have activation method

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
the fly you also have activation method
so<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> change<00:01:55.829> how<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> activate<00:01:56.880> badger

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so you can change how to activate badger

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.200 
so you can change how to activate badger

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
right now it's on the default swipe up

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789 
right now it's on the default swipe up
on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> icon<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.079> change<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> swipe

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
on the icon you can change it to swipe

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.499 
on the icon you can change it to swipe
down<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.219> icon<00:02:02.610> double<00:02:02.969> tap<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.420> icon

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
down on icon double tap on the icon

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.620 
down on icon double tap on the icon
which<00:02:04.049> doesn't<00:02:04.469> work<00:02:04.710> too<00:02:05.070> well<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:06.450> actually

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
which doesn't work too well it actually

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.889 
which doesn't work too well it actually
causes<00:02:07.229> sort<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:07.950> delay<00:02:08.750> when<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
causes sort of a little delay when you

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.780 
causes sort of a little delay when you
launch<00:02:10.259> apps<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.160> wouldn't<00:02:11.580> recommend

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
launch apps and so I wouldn't recommend

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.640 
launch apps and so I wouldn't recommend
using<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.930> tap<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
using that the tap on the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
using that the tap on the
though<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> takes<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.450> little

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
though as you can see it takes a little

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.569 
though as you can see it takes a little
getting<00:02:15.689> used<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.379> actually<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:17.040> right<00:02:17.430> on

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
getting used to to actually get right on

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.530 
getting used to to actually get right on
that<00:02:17.610> batch<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.019> be<00:02:19.349> pretty<00:02:19.920> precise

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
that batch you have to be pretty precise

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.619 
that batch you have to be pretty precise
when<00:02:21.540> launching<00:02:22.400> badger<00:02:23.400> using<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.030> tap<00:02:24.360> on

very simple the way that works now one

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.809 
very simple the way that works now one
of<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> more<00:02:37.409> disappointing<00:02:37.760> aspects<00:02:38.760> of

this great look to this tweak it looks
very<00:03:21.750> good<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.500> functionality<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.400> just

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
very good but the functionality is just

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.240 
very good but the functionality is just
sort<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.629> half-baked<00:03:25.169> unfortunately<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.190> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
sort of half-baked unfortunately and I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.039 
sort of half-baked unfortunately and I
think<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.730> sad<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.389> developer

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
think that is sad because the developer

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.050 
think that is sad because the developer
is<00:03:28.169> a<00:03:28.199> really<00:03:28.620> great<00:03:28.799> guy<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.069> obviously

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
is a really great guy is obviously

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.119 
is a really great guy is obviously
worked<00:03:30.569> hard<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.109> tweak<00:03:31.379> but<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:31.949> just

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
worked hard on this tweak but it's just

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.939 
worked hard on this tweak but it's just
really<00:03:32.400> something<00:03:32.849> i<00:03:32.940> can't<00:03:33.269> recommend

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
really something i can't recommend

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.729 
really something i can't recommend
because<00:03:34.949> it<00:03:35.310> doesn't<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.180> make<00:03:36.389> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
because it doesn't really make the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.530 
because it doesn't really make the
notifications<00:03:37.819> experience<00:03:38.819> any<00:03:39.030> better<00:03:39.329> in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
notifications experience any better in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.599 
notifications experience any better in
fact<00:03:39.840> i<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.739> hinders<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.280> more<00:03:41.489> than

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
fact i think it hinders it more than

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.789 
fact i think it hinders it more than
helps<00:03:41.909> it<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.019> being<00:03:43.199> said<00:03:43.290> if<00:03:43.680> you
