00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
like everything they do and even though

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.130 
like everything they do and even though
it's<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> differ<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.109> just

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it's going to differ I think they just

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's going to differ I think they just
kind<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.619> progressing<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.460> band<00:02:05.759> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
kind of like progressing as a band and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.639 
kind of like progressing as a band and
Kyle<00:02:06.810> Beach<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.170> been<00:02:07.259> around<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.560> long

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
Kyle Beach would have been around a long

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.380 
Kyle Beach would have been around a long
time<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.250> kind<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.759> makes<00:02:08.910> sense<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.269> maybe

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
time so kind of makes sense that maybe

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.910

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.949 
but I think that's really cool because
even<00:02:59.849> though<00:02:59.970> they're<00:03:00.209> all<00:03:00.239> really<00:03:00.450> different

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
even though they're all really different

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.330 
even though they're all really different
it's<00:03:01.200> kind<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.410> cool<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.739> they<00:03:01.859> try<00:03:02.099> out<00:03:02.130> a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
it's kind of cool that they try out a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.830 
it's kind of cool that they try out a
lot<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.639> different<00:03:02.970> types<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.329> music<00:03:03.599> and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
lot of different types of music and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.539 
lot of different types of music and
everything<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.769> they<00:03:04.859> put<00:03:05.099> out<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.430> like

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
everything that they put out is like

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.220 
everything that they put out is like
literally<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.180> totally<00:03:06.810> different<00:03:07.139> than

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
literally like totally different than

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.750 
literally like totally different than
the<00:03:07.290> last<00:03:07.440> album<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.190> kind<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.430> never<00:03:08.549> knew

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the last album so you kind of never knew

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.580 
the last album so you kind of never knew
what<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:08.910> expect<00:03:09.389> but<00:03:09.569> at<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> same<00:03:09.930> time<00:03:10.169> it

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
what to expect but at the same time it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.750 
what to expect but at the same time it
kind<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.859> still<00:03:11.040> has<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
kind of still has like that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000 
kind of still has like that
panic<00:03:12.150> sound<00:03:12.359> so<00:03:12.599> you<00:03:12.690> know<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:12.959> panic<00:03:13.230> plus

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
panic sound so you know it's panic plus

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.710 
panic sound so you know it's panic plus
they<00:03:14.190> do<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.430> really<00:03:14.970> really<00:03:15.000> good<00:03:15.389> job<00:03:15.540> with

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
they do a really really good job with

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.240 
they do a really really good job with
everything<00:03:16.049> they<00:03:16.139> put<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.769> like

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
everything they put out so like

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220 
everything they put out so like
basically<00:03:17.760> they<00:03:18.180> could<00:03:18.269> delete<00:03:18.540> anything<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
basically they could delete anything and

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.690 
basically they could delete anything and
it<00:03:19.769> would<00:03:19.889> probably<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.250> good<00:03:20.430> another

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
it would probably be really good another

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000 
it would probably be really good another
band<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.389> absolutely<00:03:21.690> love<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.680> My

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
band that I absolutely love is My

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.580 
band that I absolutely love is My
Chemical<00:03:23.250> Romance<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.290> none

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
Chemical Romance and I think that none

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.280 
Chemical Romance and I think that none
of<00:03:25.620> us<00:03:25.799> will<00:03:26.160> ever<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:27.180> over<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.810> unspeakable

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
of us will ever get over the unspeakable

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.890 
of us will ever get over the unspeakable
breakup<00:03:29.190> which<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.940> don't<00:03:30.359> really<00:03:30.630> want<00:03:30.870> to

breakup which I don't really want to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.720 
breakup which I don't really want to
talk<00:03:31.169> about<00:03:31.380> they<00:03:32.040> would<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.310> keep<00:03:32.489> carrying

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
think Bring Me The Horizon is really

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.550 
think Bring Me The Horizon is really
awesome<00:06:55.850> band<00:06:56.270> and<00:06:56.539> some<00:06:56.780> people<00:06:57.110> I<00:06:57.320> guess

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
awesome band and some people I guess

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.990 
awesome band and some people I guess
don't<00:06:57.740> like<00:06:57.950> their<00:06:58.130> music<00:06:58.310> as<00:06:58.610> much<00:06:58.760> for<00:06:58.910> they

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
don't like their music as much for they

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.279 
don't like their music as much for they
think<00:06:59.060> it's<00:06:59.270> kind<00:06:59.419> of<00:06:59.450> different<00:06:59.780> and<00:06:59.870> softer

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
think it's kind of different and softer

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.870 
think it's kind of different and softer
than<00:07:00.650> what<00:07:00.830> it<00:07:00.950> used<00:07:00.979> to<00:07:01.130> be<00:07:01.220> which<00:07:01.490> maybe<00:07:01.700> it

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
than what it used to be which maybe it

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.490 
than what it used to be which maybe it
kind<00:07:02.060> of<00:07:02.120> is<00:07:02.270> and<00:07:02.539> their<00:07:02.930> world<00:07:03.080> music<00:07:03.169> is
