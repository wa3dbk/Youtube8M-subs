00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi everyone i get 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.389
 today for the recipe of the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.979
 week 

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:11.570
 so today we will do a 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:15.150
 zucchini courgette 1 compote 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.439
 Chinese aubergines so I had 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.910
 actually did last week on 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.789
 facebook I told you that I have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.859
 makes a compote of zucchini at the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.929
 Chinese and you've been several to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.649
 to be curious and to want me to 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.380
 give my recipe 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.759
 I thought I was going to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.899
 to share that since it's something 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.520
 thing that I 'm pretty regularly this 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.590
 moment especially when it's not very 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.540
 hot it's nice to eat something 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 something a little hot and then of course 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.930
 I often accompany it with a salad or 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.000
 then fruit for dessert 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 so we will start refusing with the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.510
 list of ingredients is to start again 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 I wanted to tell you that I know that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.450
 has to see but I made an elder in my 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 hair last night so that explains that 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.310
 I have all the brothel hair and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.720
 especially since I have black hands 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.460
 yes I know you have to put the gloves are 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.380
 done when we do one and dyes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 but I had no gloves and I 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.199
 recommend want to do my elder so 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 that bunge indeed to my head what 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.679
 so now I pay him and I 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.789
 have all my nails all black 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.319
 it's disgusting but you worry 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.149
 no hands are clean it's just 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.380
 that this task is so I hope it 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.659
 will leave quickly if you have any tips 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.700
 to remove that said me I 'm taking 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.619
 my shot I managed to catch up with him 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.119
 little but this morning it was the disaster 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 good then we start right away 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.799
 will need an eggplant for the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.969
 vegetable in fact it's very simple you 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.229
 can put the vegetables that you 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.179
 want me I love iron with the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.590
 zucchini and with the eggplant is there 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.229
 as I have half a squash left 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.209
 spaghetti I decided to mix the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.170
 two but the basic vegetable you put 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.299
 one you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 you can decline it to infinity for 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.470
 the seasoning at home you'll have 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 need a ginger nut you 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.350
 go stuffed animals and of course 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.119
 you see a little bit the size that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.080
 I took 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.240
 you will need a nice pod 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.299
 of garlic there she is really huge 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.670
 I admit you will also need to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.830
 nyon again so I took one 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 because he's big enough but if you 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.140
 like that you can put more 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 it's just that I still have a 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.640
 small amount and do not worry this 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.920
 will not be our only meal it's just 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 that we already have leftovers so here and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.709
 you will also need oil from 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.430
 sesame olive oil honey and 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.260
 soya sauce 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.739
 so that's what I'm going to do 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.530
 I'm going to start by peeling 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.580
 my ginger i'm going to chop it finely 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.690
 I'm going to do the same with onions 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.370
 new and garlic 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.410
 I'll put all this in the pan 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.049
 and I will meet you later and I will 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.400
 also take care of cutting in 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.319
 pieces but my vegetables 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.239
 I'll find you right after you 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.790
 explain a little bit following the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.799
 path to follow 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.780
 I finished all of a sudden so do you 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.930
 see there in the pot genius and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.350
 the new onion with ginger and 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.780
 garlic 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.850
 so that's all was cut pretty 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.620
 finely at least I try to hand this 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.239
 not always obvious so I mix 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.680
 well all that's it 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:02.569
 and on the other hand I actually put 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.639
 separately in a in a dish the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.499
 squash and zucchini finally the 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.530
 the eggplant so I bought in cubes 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:14.930
 Roughly enough is still pretty enough 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.519
 small so that this crisis quickly enough and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.469
 now we will move forward with the sauce 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.129
 so you're going to take a spoonful to 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.129
 honey soup 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.569
 so some people do not consume 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.359
 of honey so you can very well the 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.519
 replace for example with sugar from the 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.769
 syrup of agave stevia for example 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:48.590
 then you will put a 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:51.019
 chalk with olive oil soup so that 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.629
 it does not attach and then you go 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.689
 light your fire on fire I would say 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.969
 between medium and bright to be able to well 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:02.359
 grab the onions for it to start 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.909
 to fry lightly and that and that 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.500
 become all melting and with honey that 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.299
 go a little caramelized so I 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.509
 set on fire and I find you 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.509
 all alone 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.340
 so here you see the onions 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.709
 well melted it makes a consistency 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.650
 little bit is meuse like that since 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.060
 it starts to bond with the real 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.590
 now at this point there is really 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.660
 an ideal moment I find to add 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.290
 vegetables so you take all the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.460
 vegetables put them in and you 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.810
 will see that it's not even worth 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.120
 add water as the vegetables 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.000
 you make me water and less we 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.449
 add water in fact more we can 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.620
 and mineral salts since that I 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.630
 remember more how it's called 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.820
 chemical processes but hey we got you 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.100
 guard and canvas interests so blow 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.200
 you mix well you leave there this 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.270
 times on a softer fire and you go 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.590
 simmer if you find that it 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.540
 start to tie you add a little 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.110
 of water I remove my box force is not going 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.389
 never hear me and once that has 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.580
 well cooked me I find you for the 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.270
 end the continuation and the end of the season 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.190
 after that is the saaq compote 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.600
 about 25 minutes 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.949
 normally it goes a little faster but 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.210
 there I decided to put squash 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.860
 two years so it's true that it has 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.750
 slowed down the cooking process with 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.820
 I had to add water because the 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.430
 yard I did not want to cook so I 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.950
 added water and so here I have 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.789
 my my eggplant which is well behaved 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.590
 the squash is a little more a little more 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.139
 hard but it's still in the background 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.729
 meaning where the spatula so now you 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.010
 go get some soy sauce 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.660
 so I'm going to put about 2 spoons 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.780
 and good tablespoonful even 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.780
 three now of people m 2 like that me 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.440
 so that's normally expected 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.810
 suffice if you find that it is missing 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.610
 of salt you can simply 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.389
 I was a little bit of salt added a little 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.610
 soy sauce 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.380
 so there you turn well you mix 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.080
 it's not very beautiful but it's super good 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.700
 and you can add there to 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.070
 finish now a spoonful to 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.650
 soup or half a tablespoon if 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.449
 you are afraid that it is too fat of 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.460
 god of 16 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.099
 So here we are for two 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.900
 people so that's it does not matter anymore 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.029
 one tablespoon of oil per 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.599
 nobody's okay that's it 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.580
 reasonable 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:24.120
 now you mix well and 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.430
 you can serve this with apples from 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.800
 steamed earth with potatoes to 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.569
 water with rice with quinoa with 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.990
 rice with rice basmati rice 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.759
 Thai 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.409
 we are going to serve that with a little rice 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.889
 Thai because it's going very well with 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.719
 and then for dessert will have 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.219
 good clementine so here I hope 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.240
 that this recipe pleased you 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.669
 not to leave me comments

 just so have fun with that 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.229
 you have in the fridge it's not the 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:56.729
 worth buying exactly the same 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.900

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.339
