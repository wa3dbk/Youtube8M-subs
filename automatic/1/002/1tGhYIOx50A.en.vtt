that video
so<00:00:26.529> we<00:00:26.740> have<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:28.539> two<00:00:28.990> three<00:00:29.019> four<00:00:29.710> rows<00:00:30.460> for

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
so we have one two three four rows for

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.180 
so we have one two three four rows for
our<00:00:31.890> letters<00:00:32.890> each<00:00:33.340> row<00:00:33.790> is<00:00:34.059> one<00:00:34.540> centimeter

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
our letters each row is one centimeter

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.460 
our letters each row is one centimeter
wide<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.590> space<00:00:38.949> is<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:40.750> half<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.410> a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
wide and then the space is a half and a

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.390 
wide and then the space is a half and a
half<00:00:41.500> twice<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.400> half<00:00:43.140> okay<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.410> that's<00:00:45.129> it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
half twice a half okay and that's it

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.319 
half twice a half okay and that's it
let's<00:00:46.150> go<00:00:46.420> ahead<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.720> start<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:48.760> signals

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
let's go ahead and start little signals

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.460 
let's go ahead and start little signals
for<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.720> half<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.320> centimeter<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.370> another<00:00:51.820> half

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
for a half a centimeter and another half

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.649 
for a half a centimeter and another half
this<00:00:53.470> is<00:00:53.530> one<00:00:53.980> centimeter<00:00:54.519> so<00:00:55.089> we<00:00:55.989> have<00:00:56.230> here

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
this is one centimeter so we have here

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.549 
this is one centimeter so we have here
and<00:00:58.860> this<00:00:59.860> is<00:01:00.100> one<00:01:00.549> and<00:01:01.080> here<00:01:02.080> we<00:01:02.229> have<00:01:02.409> another

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
and this is one and here we have another

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:12.450 
and this is one and here we have another
half<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.920> one<00:01:09.189> again<00:01:09.760> and<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:12.310> we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
half and this is one again and here we

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.469 
half and this is one again and here we
have<00:01:13.290> again<00:01:14.290> these<00:01:14.680> are<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.009> spaces<00:01:15.490> between

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.100 

and<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.729> for<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.299> line<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.780> letters

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
and this is for the line of the letters

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:35.380 
and this is for the line of the letters
so<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.409> have<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:25.240> two<00:01:25.869> three<00:01:29.430> four

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.800 

and<00:01:35.690> two<00:01:36.440> more<00:01:36.680> spaces<00:01:37.010> here<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.630> is

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
and two more spaces here so this is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.040 
and two more spaces here so this is
actually<00:01:39.200> what<00:01:39.380> we<00:01:39.530> need<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:40.100> our<00:01:41.050> letters

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
actually what we need for our letters

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:52.500 
actually what we need for our letters
let's<00:01:42.440> do<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> statement<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.250> opposite<00:01:43.910> side

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.260 

you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 

so<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> place<00:01:59.220> we're

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
so this is going to be the place we're

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.420 
so this is going to be the place we're
going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> draw<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.420> letters<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:02.010> we're<00:02:02.280> going

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
going to draw the letters so we're going

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.500 
going to draw the letters so we're going
to<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.670> slanted<00:02:03.440> like<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.510> we're

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
to make slanted like this and we're

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.270 
to make slanted like this and we're
going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.690> have<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.069> half

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
going to have like one and a half

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.370 
going to have like one and a half
centimeters<00:02:08.660> between<00:02:09.660> each<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.790> could

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
centimeters between each one so we could

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.640 
centimeters between each one so we could
make<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.770> one<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.520> half<00:02:14.550> three<00:02:15.650> four

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
make this is one and a half three four

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.890 
make this is one and a half three four
and<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> half<00:02:16.910> six<00:02:18.410> seven<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> half<00:02:19.620> nine<00:02:20.900> ten

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and a half six seven and a half nine ten

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.210 
and a half six seven and a half nine ten
and<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.110> half<00:02:22.940> twelve<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.890> we<00:02:25.890> need<00:02:28.100> seven<00:02:29.100> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and a half twelve and we need seven of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.180 
and a half twelve and we need seven of
these<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.730> two<00:02:30.090> three<00:02:30.570> four<00:02:30.959> five<00:02:31.440> six<00:02:31.800> seven

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
these one two three four five six seven

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.479 
these one two three four five six seven
okay<00:02:32.820> that's<00:02:33.060> it

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
okay that's it

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:44.380 
okay that's it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
second row we're going to do the same

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:59.490 
second row we're going to do the same
but<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.220> between

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.980 

now

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that's it now we are going to write the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.850 
that's it now we are going to write the
letter<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:04.070> each<00:03:05.070> space<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:07.320> this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> going<00:03:07.800> to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
letter in each space so this is going to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.430 
letter in each space so this is going to
be<00:03:08.010> our<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.750> b<00:03:09.750> c<00:03:11.150> okay<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.360> are<00:03:12.510> done<00:03:12.750> you're
