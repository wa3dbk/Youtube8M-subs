00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
then there's the tower Babel then

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.410 
then there's the tower Babel then
there's<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.490> flood<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:21.939> then<00:01:22.060> there's<00:01:22.240> all

there's the flood and then there's all
that<00:01:22.600> watch<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:22.960> there's<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.200> flood<00:01:23.409> and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
that watch so there's the flood and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.080 
that watch so there's the flood and
tower<00:01:23.799> Babel<00:01:24.009> sorry<00:01:24.369> I<00:01:24.400> got<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.549> backwards

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
tower Babel sorry I got that backwards

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.090 
tower Babel sorry I got that backwards
it's<00:01:25.540> failure<00:01:25.990> after<00:01:26.200> failure<00:01:26.380> after<00:01:26.920> failure

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
it's failure after failure after failure

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.370 
it's failure after failure after failure

after failure after failure and then
finally<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:29.920> culminates<00:01:30.400> in<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> only

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
finally it culminates in the only

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.240 
finally it culminates in the only

why didn't he just forgive her buddy or

change the laws but instead he has to

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.690

create a loophole where he comes down

to act as a loophole for a rule that he
created<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.310> absurd

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
created it's absurd

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.859 
created it's absurd
it<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.630> not<00:01:46.960> absurd<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.340> it's<00:01:48.520> immoral<00:01:48.909> no

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
it is not absurd and it's immoral no

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.219 
it is not absurd and it's immoral no
you're<00:01:50.500> not<00:01:50.649> looking<00:01:51.070> there's<00:01:51.689> two<00:01:52.689> entities

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
you're not looking there's two entities

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.910 
you're not looking there's two entities
you<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> fallen<00:01:54.939> angel<00:01:55.090> named<00:01:55.630> Lucifer

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you have a fallen angel named Lucifer

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
you have a fallen angel named Lucifer
then<00:01:56.920> he's<00:01:57.130> all-powerful

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
then he's all-powerful

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.889 
then he's all-powerful
he's<00:01:59.500> more<00:01:59.710> powerful<00:02:00.090> no<00:02:01.090> then<00:02:01.509> why<00:02:01.659> doesn't

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
he's more powerful no then why doesn't

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.370 
he's more powerful no then why doesn't
