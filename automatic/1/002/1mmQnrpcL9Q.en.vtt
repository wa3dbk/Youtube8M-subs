 what happened a little problem brings you and for the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.830
 moment not 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.690
 if I must confess that it was letters through 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.230
 a stanza we did not know if we have gold 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.300
 the stanza wants a thing like that 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.370
 very fast because he was distracted too 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.800
 also I am has brought love to her 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.800
 life as sisi with love that explains 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.600
 not the truth I'm not alone as usual 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.520
 no longer brings chocolates to anyone in the 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.810
 tour because I do not think the tours brought 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:03.990
 chocolates of them someone and stuffed animal 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:07.400
 he brought specific people to someone in 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.400
 specific that we do not know 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.050
 To who 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.050
 a mutal girl 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.630
 2 I was just leaving the track 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.699
 to jump a pomegranate outlet 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:34.419
 and which ones received the chocolates and the 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:35.440
 stuffed animal and stuffed chocolates and that must 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.660
 be the chocolates 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.040
 this is the tin can the case is 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.419
 the other 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.870
 well then they received the 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.500
 chocolates yes very friendly and which with more 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.500
 amiability 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:57.120
 the good teacher is doing well 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.120
 Japanese ninja language death 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.720
 [Laughs] 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:10.100
 pretty, pretty 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.680
 sand for good let's go to the concrete and 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.290
 the concrete thing is that except for that 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.900
 small letter theme is good to see this 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.710
 so solid imitation on the stage very 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.010
 good very good 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.630
 I also think that when we talk about 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.120
 weight is technical many imitators that 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.400
 have gained weight others have gained weight of 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.500
 age these technicians this invitation 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.120
 also grabs a little more of the body of 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.090
 Scenic weight on stage is 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.670
 imitating someone bigger than he had 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.740
 this song that is for this song 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.170
 calamaro that would have about 40 years 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.150
 when the whole more suddenly I do not know 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.090
 very well some expert will criticize me 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.520
 by twitter about it but this one and 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.360
 you do not have no more than 25 I think no 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.860
 it's true 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.830
 23 20 imagine then also 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.650
 requires some physical exercise 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.330
 interpret someone older and goes by 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.420
 good way with that I suggest that 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.790
 I also develop it more very well 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.050
 gentlemen of the jury many thanks to 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.050
