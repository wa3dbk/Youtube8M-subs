00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.450
 welcome comrades gamers all of you 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.090
 surely you know excellent polish 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.340
 campaign city ​​interactive these guys 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.920
 occasionally delight us with normal 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.080
 budget jester us last year this 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.610
 It was a very decent fun challenge 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.730
 about aliens 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.490
 Well, here is their new project and we are the front 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.220
 Now, about the second world if I honestly 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.050
 already rather miss this subject so 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.220
 that you can drive with pleasure 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.170
 Fritz since the game was made by the fields of China 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.820
 we will fight accordingly 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.700
 poles that is to observe events 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.080
 the eyes of the Polish resistance during 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.810
 uprising in warsaw 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.180
 which is quite interesting because usually 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:59.890
 in similar games we drive Russian and 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.720
 the ends were at the worst by the British in 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.390
 but the main character will still be 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.250
 Americans do not know why seems to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.710
 order to conquer the american 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.079
 hawkins correspondent audience with 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.539
 Polish roots but although he was 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.999
 simple journalists but the war no one 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.969
 bypass and to survive the guy 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.759
 I had to take mp-40 from a murdered German and 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.399
 join resistance since where 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.890
 but not yet been alive 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.450
 rushes into battle take pictures and writes 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.450
 articles about what a fine fellow 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.250
 the very beginning of the game we are sharply thrown into 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.650
 hurricane and action kintso with tyr think 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.160
 what is now going to be polish call of 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.070
 duty 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.980
 but do not believe the game is not like that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.350
 rather stopper 2 gost varrior past 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.260
 the game of poles and city only now about 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.510
 Germans in the company we also will not see 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.479
 landing in normandy no any other 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.640
 famous events this is such a local 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.979
 the history of the Polish partisans and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.860
 American journalist and very 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.070
 badly drawn and poorly voiced and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.200
 no interesting at all plus missions 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.600
 in this perry are changing missions in 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.360
 past Hawkins where he gave heat during 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.450
 France along with a pretty butterfly 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 also so angular and even drove the Germans 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.730
 on snowy Norwegian mountains 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.310
 the architecture of the level of the game also reminds 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.370
 their sniper him there is some kind of goal 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.140
 there is a long map and on the way to the task 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.420
 you meet groups of enemies 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.400
 they can either be stupidly shot or 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.810
 get around by either destroy all 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.540
 stealth is your choice 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.519
 of course there is and everyones cinema level in 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.280
 style call of duty but they are found 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.980
 infrequently so how to say level 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.500
 a little bit not the budget of the game climbs 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.660
 from all the gaps from badly drawn 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.360
 videos between missions to quite often 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.400
 encountered bugs yes it's just 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.680
 two gun hands stick out right out 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.390
 air see this is a parallel world where 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.910
 live hands and guns 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.220
 there are also those worlds where that's live pony 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.070
 know this should be all logical and 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.380
 so we run with partisans and in Warsaw 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.780
 the catacombs and the streets are doing different 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.150
 sabotage mission moisten Fritz in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.850
 huge quantities and may well be 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.430
 we get from this pleasure to shoot 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.519
 nice fun fritz lot of ammo 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.110
 also dofiga everything will be fine and all 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.690
 obligatory entertainment like 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.420
 sniper ambush and tank shooting 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.970
 machine guns if ever released 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.970
 game about the second world without sniper 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.440
 Terai shooting from tank machine guns 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.890
 it means I won't have to say all this 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.860
 you 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.990
 and then the world will never be the same 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.800
 even doors can be knocked out as well 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.800
 captain price 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.120
 Well, as they say with the world on a string of Poles 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.640
 shooter after this disgrace usually 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.159
 flashback missions come where hocking 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.829
 chases the world and helps the partisans in 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.709
 doing different parts of the world at the same time 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.620
 sensational shots taking into account that 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.020
 we are the main character and essentially we do the whole 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.050
 the work is kind of like Hawkins himself and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.090
 commits exploits about which then writes 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:36.139
 as they say you want to do something 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:38.599
 well do it yourself but by the way those 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.910
 very village in france is very very 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.820
 similar to sniper GOST option 2 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.370
 same long type line card 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.770
 the road on which we are alternately issued 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.930
 several basic and additional 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.060
 assignments and now have just written 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.599
 scribble at the table journalist already with 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.740
 exploding without problems 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:09.199
 armored vehicles even by the way and kill 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:11.690
 cameras are just like snipers all 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.120
 passage the game strongly wants 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.669
 so we passed and stealth where not 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.639
 look everywhere enemies stand with you and 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.949
 so they ask for a knife if you want 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.680
 You can stealth and if you do not want to take 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.479
 eat machine guns and spire left-right 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.780
 the main choice is for stealth passing 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.720
 have all the necessary amenities please 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.030
 come up behind and quietly cut enemies 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.099
 and if it doesn't work out you can always 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.099
 continue with the old-fashioned method 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.449
 they will be obtained often even in 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.839
 active battles enemies stupid but in 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.089
 stealth very quickly notice the player 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.839
 hear well and find corpses easily 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.599
 Kamchatka 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.059
 literally just a couple of places I managed 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.159
 stealth is best 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:01.740
 don't kill anyone and don't shoot at all 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:04.259
 pass by and then it may turn out 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.809
 and even cooler let's stupidly run on 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.180
 task marker even if the alarm was raised 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:11.309
 still manages to run into the cherished 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.259
 door and hoop you're already in a new location 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.899
 I know nothing like you have not seen anyone 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.270
 there is an opportunity to distract enemies 

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:20.819
 rush cobblestones and even drag 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.919
 corpses I honestly these chips at all 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:25.409
 I never used a game 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:38.999
 here's a pistol with a silencer shot 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:41.430
 with pleasure a good advantage of the game 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.740
 is the graphics game on the engine edge 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.139
 the engine looks pretty nice nothing 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.479
 special but nice well here which was 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.580
 the last joker about the second world I already 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.919
 I do not remember the pancake call of duty world at 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.439
 war unless or some red there 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.060
 door cyst in general, all without grafon and here 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.860
 pretty pretty especially 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.349
 french village the very me 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.509
 liked so if you like the second 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:07.050
 world can see here she 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:09.059
 looks not bad turned out unfortunately 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.759
 shu tanchik below average after 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:14.490
 last year or Andreic I know that these 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.189
 guys can do better but this time somehow 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.379
 failed but I sure once they sure 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:22.050
 stop making budget clones and 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.149
 forgetting something so soulful 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.029
 but if you still can not live without 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:29.159
 everyones there MP-40 Panzerfaust of and 

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:31.680
 other joys of the second world then 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.629
 we can still play in front 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.479
 in the end some kind of grafonchik 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:38.399
 Well, there is a multiplayer too, although 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.159
 I think in a month it's all the same for 

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:43.830
 network game horseradish find people six of 

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:46.439
 ten more polish jokes but 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.629
 this time somehow weakly went out to everyone 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:50.639
 thanks, be sure to subscribe to the channel 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:51.930
 put your thumb up look 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.000
 my past review 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.320
 they are right here here is their 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.320
 really a lot for now
