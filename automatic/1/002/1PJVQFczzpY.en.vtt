00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
going to see I think what we're going to

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.510 
going to see I think what we're going to

Kakashi<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.940> guess<00:04:43.940> failing<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.450> say<00:04:44.630> Britain

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990

and<00:04:45.110> bring<00:04:45.680> dies<00:04:45.920> I<00:04:46.280> think<00:04:46.970> what's<00:04:47.120> going<00:04:47.210> to

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
and bring dies I think what's going to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.990 
and bring dies I think what's going to
happen<00:04:47.600> is<00:04:47.830> when<00:04:48.830> obito<00:04:49.280> gets<00:04:49.460> out<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.910> this

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
happen is when obito gets out of this

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000 
happen is when obito gets out of this
dungeon<00:04:50.210> place<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.840> back<00:04:51.470> into<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.710> Ninja

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
dungeon place and back into the Ninja

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.760 
dungeon place and back into the Ninja
world<00:04:52.060> he's<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.930> Jets<00:04:54.440> who<00:04:54.530> brings

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
world he's going and the Jets who brings

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.980 
world he's going and the Jets who brings
him<00:04:54.920> took<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.130> caution<00:04:55.460> Ren's<00:04:55.610> area<00:04:55.990> we're

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
him took a caution Ren's area we're

him took a caution Ren's area we're
going<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.170> see<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.710> think<00:04:58.480> possibly<00:04:59.830> i<00:05:00.830> don't

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
going to see I think possibly i don't

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.910

know<00:05:01.820> Kakashi<00:05:02.240> escaping<00:05:02.720> Kakashi<00:05:03.170> failing<00:05:03.770> I

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
know Kakashi escaping Kakashi failing I

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.010 
know Kakashi escaping Kakashi failing I
think<00:05:04.580> we're<00:05:04.670> going<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:04.880> see<00:05:04.910> red<00:05:05.270> dye<00:05:05.540> like

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
think we're going to see red dye like

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.050 
think we're going to see red dye like
how<00:05:06.110> she<00:05:06.200> dies<00:05:06.470> or<00:05:06.650> something<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.070> told<00:05:07.970> me

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
how she dies or something and told me

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.330 
how she dies or something and told me
obito<00:05:08.540> will<00:05:08.660> witness<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.350> don't<00:05:10.130> think

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
obito will witness that I don't think

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.530 
obito will witness that I don't think
he's<00:05:10.520> he<00:05:11.270> might<00:05:11.510> not<00:05:11.950> interfere<00:05:13.060> maybe<00:05:14.060> after

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
he's he might not interfere maybe after

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.050
