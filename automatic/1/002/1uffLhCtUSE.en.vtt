what<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:26.910> your<00:00:27.029> thoughts<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> Tegra<00:00:27.960> 4

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
what are your thoughts about the Tegra 4

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.710 
what are your thoughts about the Tegra 4
technology<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> next

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
technology I think it's like the next

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.139 
technology I think it's like the next
step<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> evolution<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.969> bring

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
step in the evolution and so it's bring

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.700 
step in the evolution and so it's bring
out<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> more<00:00:33.840> power<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.590> can

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
out like the more power of which we can

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.440 
out like the more power of which we can
use<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.390> in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> game<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:38.000> we<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.149> use<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
use and in the game so we can use it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.619 
use and in the game so we can use it
like<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> photo<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.680> FX<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.370> more

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
like the photo for other FX have more

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.030 
like the photo for other FX have more
polygons<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.410> characters<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
polygons and more characters on the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.760 
polygons and more characters on the
screen<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.850> pretty<00:00:45.000> happy<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
screen so they are pretty happy with it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.260 
screen so they are pretty happy with it
when<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> comes<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.219> project<00:00:47.640> shield<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.210> do

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
game we changed a lot of things not like

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
game we changed a lot of things not like
the<00:01:18.180> base<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.780> correct<00:01:19.740> features<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.610> we

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the base of correct features because we

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.350 
the base of correct features because we
think<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.450> FBS<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.470> shooting<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.210> did

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
think that the FBS so shooting is we did

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
think that the FBS so shooting is we did
very<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> trigger<00:01:25.290> ivana<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.250> we

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
very well in the trigger ivana so so we

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.880 
very well in the trigger ivana so so we
concentrate<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.119> other<00:01:27.240> things

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
concentrate on some other things

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950 
concentrate on some other things
we<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.610> changing<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> more

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
we are changing it to like the more

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.590 
we are changing it to like the more
global<00:01:31.830> zombie<00:01:32.430> welfare<00:01:32.880> than<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
global zombie welfare than just the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 
global zombie welfare than just the
arcade<00:01:34.500> shooter<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.190> for<00:01:35.820> those<00:01:35.940> who<00:01:36.420> haven't

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
