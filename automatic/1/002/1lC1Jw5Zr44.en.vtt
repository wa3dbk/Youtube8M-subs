00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
revolution in motor world so I made this

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.200 
revolution in motor world so I made this
video<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.990> will<00:00:26.140> be<00:00:26.200> able<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.710> me<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.880> magnet

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
video it will be able to me the magnet

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.170 
video it will be able to me the magnet
motor<00:00:28.450> is<00:00:28.660> not<00:00:28.840> working<00:00:29.380> it's<00:00:29.770> three<00:00:30.610> pieces

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
motor is not working it's three pieces

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.430 
motor is not working it's three pieces
of<00:00:31.420> time<00:00:31.720> is<00:00:32.470> not<00:00:33.660> working<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.280> made<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
of time is not working so I made this

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.820 
of time is not working so I made this
for<00:00:39.809> magnet<00:00:40.809> motor<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.160> see<00:00:42.850> there<00:00:43.629> is

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
for magnet motor and see there is

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.030 
for magnet motor and see there is
nothing<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:45.120> had<00:00:46.120> no<00:00:46.360> electric<00:00:46.960> wires<00:00:47.230> and

this<00:00:55.899> is<00:00:56.050> I<00:00:56.260> have<00:00:56.620> black<00:00:57.160> magnet<00:00:57.610> and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.840 

look<00:01:02.010> how<00:01:02.250> its<00:01:02.520> work<00:01:03.710> what<00:01:04.710> hot<00:01:04.980> because<00:01:05.550> what

the<00:01:29.100> speed<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.580> not<00:01:30.260> enough<00:01:31.260> because<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.250> am

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
the speed is not enough because I am

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.990 
the speed is not enough because I am
manually<00:01:33.420> operated<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.440> this

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
manually operated there with this

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.560 
manually operated there with this
magnets<00:01:36.000> motor<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:41.509> when<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> fix<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.080> properly

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
magnets motor so when I fix it properly

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.960 
magnets motor so when I fix it properly
the<00:01:45.570> motor<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.290> well<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.670> pick<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.820> that
