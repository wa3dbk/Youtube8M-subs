00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
this information I'm getting at least

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.250 
this information I'm getting at least
eight<00:02:09.020> hundred<00:02:09.290> views<00:02:09.440> um<00:02:10.690> my<00:02:11.690> Bolivian<00:02:12.080> life

eight hundred views um my Bolivian life

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.550 
eight hundred views um my Bolivian life
is<00:02:12.520> good<00:02:13.520> but<00:02:14.270> for<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.050> most<00:02:15.200> part<00:02:15.320> I'm

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
is good but for the most part I'm

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.350 
is good but for the most part I'm
getting<00:02:15.800> anywhere<00:02:16.010> from<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:16.220> eight<00:02:16.970> hundred

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
getting anywhere from like eight hundred

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
getting anywhere from like eight hundred
views<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.810> leverage<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.560> couple<00:02:19.160> thousand

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
views to leverage a couple thousand

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.620 
views to leverage a couple thousand
views<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:21.610> don't<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.270> not<00:02:23.390> making

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
views so I don't like it's not making

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.910 
views so I don't like it's not making
sense<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.900> me<00:02:24.020> how<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.260> get<00:02:24.530> more<00:02:24.740> subscribers

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
sense to me how I get more subscribers

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.300 
sense to me how I get more subscribers
but<00:02:25.430> less<00:02:25.610> views<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:27.740> mostly<00:02:28.070> because

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
but less views and it's mostly because

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.250 
but less views and it's mostly because
people<00:02:28.730> are<00:02:28.820> telling<00:02:29.000> me<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.960> know<00:02:30.020> it's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
people are telling me and I know it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.510 
people are telling me and I know it's
because<00:02:30.440> my<00:02:30.470> videos<00:02:30.770> aren't<00:02:30.920> showing<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.400> in

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
because my videos aren't showing up in

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.770 
because my videos aren't showing up in
people's<00:02:31.790> sub<00:02:31.940> boxes<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.390> I'm<00:02:32.450> hoping

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
people's sub boxes and I'm hoping

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.500 
people's sub boxes and I'm hoping
YouTube<00:02:33.110> dis<00:02:33.290> eventually<00:02:33.770> corrects<00:02:34.070> itself

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
YouTube dis eventually corrects itself

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.390 
YouTube dis eventually corrects itself
because<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.750> kind<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.470> unmotivating<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.280> was

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
because it's kind of unmotivating I was

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.700 
because it's kind of unmotivating I was
really<00:02:37.640> excited<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.660> bunch<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.590> new

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
really excited to see all a bunch of new

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.430 
really excited to see all a bunch of new
subscribers<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.550> then<00:02:40.960> I'm<00:02:41.960> not<00:02:42.140> seeing<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
subscribers but then I'm not seeing to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.130 
subscribers but then I'm not seeing to
