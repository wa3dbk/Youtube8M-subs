00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello everyone today we will continue 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.690
 consider course play learn in volume 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.299
 aspect of how we bring our courses to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.880
 order that is scatter them into folders 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 These folders first need to be created as they are. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 move and so on so on 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.109
 let's say so about this aspect i'm a little bit 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 I forgot to even say that I 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.460
 where he has not truncated 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 and just the other day there was a question in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.820
 comments and had to answer not here 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.780
 I got the idea that not 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.629
 it would also hurt to tell about it 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.510
 video well ulma u case i think you all 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 remember that in order to somehow 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.760
 manipulate with courses and generally 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.190
 To get to the course by the plugin you need to be in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.129
 any unit of press technique now and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.540
 let 's do it now we will plant a scoop 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.740
 jaman and see what we have for 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.420
 order to govern 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.680
 courses we need to go to this one 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.110
 fold vodka load the route here too 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.530
 we show all the courses and how 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.170
 in folders so not in the root of the deck 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.630
 let's say so well and the first thing we try 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 make it create so will we 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.600
 create a folder for example grass 2 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.890
 sorry or maybe part 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.410
 while Cyrillic is not supported that is 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.929
 have to type all call all 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.210
 courses and Latin then at least not 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.590
 met version of cosplay case 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.539
 Cyrillic was supported 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.020
 Yes, in principle, this is enough 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.539
 as for me the fact that there is so here we 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.899
 created by simply clicking on this one 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.259
 button to create a new folder 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.899
 new how and here we created this folder 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.680
 now we will try something in it somehow 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.329
 move well let 's get something by itself 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.440
 simple logic we for example have 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.720
 written down sharply Volska alone and we put her there 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.400
 move this course translate into that 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.090
 how to do this we need 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.970
 press the button here is such a daddy 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.420
 with up arrow this move to button 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.120
 fly bird is move to folder we're on 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.610
 we press it and we are offered where to us 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.060
 this folder can be the glade file 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.160
 can move here all are displayed 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.900
 folders and in addition we can it 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.500
 move to root 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.390
 it caught 0 essentially he's here you now 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.329
 and this course is located so we 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 Shuffle to folder 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.440
 grass 2 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.750
 To do this we press the same on 5 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.599
 button monster folder but already with 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.239
 arrow down click and you have it 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.780
 it turns out already now the warriors are known 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.480
 you can open the folder on the plus sign and comp 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.600
 all our courses will turn out to be the way 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.540
 see not only the course can be moved 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.880
 in the folder but the folder is also possible 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.489
 move the course to the same folder 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.930
 you can extract and all as in the only 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.239
 that by the way is a very good thing 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.100
 good idea that the folder cannot be deleted 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.980
 that is, until in the folder 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.790
 there are at least one course I am 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.950
 can not be deleted 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.170
 in order to delete the folder we need 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.090
 either delete the course corresponding 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.870
 which is this or his 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.760
 translate what we do now and so 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.110
 we weigh a course grass sk1 transfer 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.110
 for example in the same folder grass 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.000
 so we have a folder grass 2 became 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.780
 empty and we can remove it here anal 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.210
 ass is sherlock 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.610
 let's create some more again 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.350
 folder for example it became three why not 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.220
 save and here we have a folder 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.860
 grass let's move the h1 folder again 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.590
 in the root directory that is as if in 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.590
 root for this we need to select a folder 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.460
 volt root folder 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.500
 again we have this course here or 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.320
 we for repetition say as repetition 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 the mother of the teachings will transfer him here though 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.680
 again if the goal is worth moving 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.330
 transfer course file from one folder to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.220
 the other is not required to carry it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.420
 you can go straight to the root directory first 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.690
 from folder to folder the same applies to 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.580
 folders as threads 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.620
 bow folder twisted out on horse root 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.460
 gurney 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:56.360
 from my grass here we have here is 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.880
 and now we have it all along with everyone 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.240
 courses translate for example into the grass folder 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.240
 that 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:10.239
 here we have it all here somehow 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:13.629
 In principle, everything is easy, everything is clear to anyone 

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:16.539
 advise you when dealing with folders with 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:20.619
 courses quite say so to develop 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:25.029
 some system to make it so 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:27.009
 here we still move the grass folder 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:32.669
 grass 3 we can remove it to us no longer 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:34.269
 we need and now we have everything in order again 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.729
 as wanted 

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:38.919
 and the wife wanted to say that 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.679
 work and systematization of courses 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.659
 try to come up with some kind of system 

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:45.369
 which will allow you to easily understand 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.789
 to navigate because 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:51.399
 navigate in 10 courses is a question 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:55.839
 number 1 and navigate to 50 or more 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:58.089
 the course of the records is also hard therefore 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.559
 for this and that were invented folders and 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.389
 and sin not to be confused 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.909
 among other things there is also 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.389
 provided you search them never 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.529
 enjoyed trying to arrange and 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.539
 systematize the course so that 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.899
 so convenient to use them 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.119
 find them and never confuse them 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.839
 although as they say, and the old woman happens 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:21.989
 a hole 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:24.329
 it happens that every thing is probably all that 

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:26.679
 I wanted to say about this 

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:30.189
 information is not much but nevertheless I 

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:34.089
 I hope she will at least some 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:37.509
 of you useful and help when working with 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:40.419
 course playing but that's all thanks to all 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.459
 for your attention leave comments 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:46.439
