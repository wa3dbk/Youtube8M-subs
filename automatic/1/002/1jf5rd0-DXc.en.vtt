used it but God is loud I've used things

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.020 
used it but God is loud I've used things
like<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> Hornet<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.340> airs<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
like the Hornet and the airs and in the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
like the Hornet and the airs and in the
past<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:25.860> they're<00:01:26.130> around<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
past and you know they're around the the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.609 
past and you know they're around the the
one<00:01:28.909> 110<00:01:29.990> 115<00:01:30.990> 120<00:01:31.650> decibel<00:01:32.100> range<00:01:33.619> not

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
one 110 115 120 decibel range not

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
one 110 115 120 decibel range not
necessarily<00:01:35.810> practical<00:01:36.810> there's<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
necessarily practical there's an you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.700 
necessarily practical there's an you
need<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> keep<00:01:37.950> pumping<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:38.700> broke<00:01:39.710> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
need to keep pumping up my broke the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
need to keep pumping up my broke the
Hornet<00:01:41.070> doesn't<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:42.000> sound<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.740> horn

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
Hornet doesn't really sound like a horn

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.260 
Hornet doesn't really sound like a horn
or<00:01:43.890> anything<00:01:43.950> else<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.520> you'd<00:01:44.820> hear<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
or anything else that you'd hear on the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
or anything else that you'd hear on the
road<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.500> drivers<00:01:46.979> take<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> same

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
road so I think drivers take the same

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.270 
road so I think drivers take the same
notice<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.680> has<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> switch<00:01:50.130> up

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
notice of it so this one has a switch up

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.819 
notice of it so this one has a switch up
here<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.810> only<00:01:51.899> annoyance<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:52.500> had<00:01:52.649> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
here and the only annoyance I've had so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.130 
here and the only annoyance I've had so
far<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.430> switch<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
far with this switch is that the the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.950 
far with this switch is that the the
fastening<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.860> too<00:01:56.070> long<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.540> wrapped<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
fastening is too long so I've wrapped it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.030 
fastening is too long so I've wrapped it

mounted on this bike the cockpit

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.080 
mounted on this bike the cockpit
anywhere<00:02:07.770> else<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.429> isn't<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> like

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
anywhere else this isn't this is like

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.150 
anywhere else this isn't this is like
the<00:02:09.239> last<00:02:09.450> place<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.899> should<00:02:09.929> put<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.319> but

it's like here or they recommend on here

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.910 
it's like here or they recommend on here
which<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.700> can't<00:02:20.240> fail<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.710> bike

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
which I can't fail on this on this bike

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.140 
which I can't fail on this on this bike
due<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.730> other<00:02:22.880> things<00:02:23.090> being<00:02:23.270> there<00:02:25.060> they<00:02:26.060> I'm

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
due to other things being there they I'm

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
due to other things being there they I'm
just<00:02:26.360> testing<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.780> out<00:02:26.990> see<00:02:27.440> how<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.680> goes

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
just testing this out see how it goes

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.470 
just testing this out see how it goes
easier<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.370> my<00:02:28.550> commute<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.880> few<00:02:29.030> times<00:02:29.240> in<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
easier on my commute a few times in the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.840 
easier on my commute a few times in the
new<00:02:29.600> year<00:02:29.810> see<00:02:30.620> how<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.800> works<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
new year see how it works but the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.100 
new year see how it works but the
important<00:02:32.210> thing<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.390> what<00:02:32.690> does<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:32.870> sound

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
important thing is what does this sound

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.910 
important thing is what does this sound
like<00:02:33.400> what<00:02:34.400> does<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.700> sound<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.510> let's<00:02:35.660> uh

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
like what does it sound like so let's uh

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.270 
like what does it sound like so let's uh
let's<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.160> fire<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.370> off

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
let's just fire it off

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.510 
let's just fire it off
pretty<00:02:40.280> loud<00:02:41.290> pretty<00:02:42.290> damn<00:02:42.680> loud<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
pretty loud pretty damn loud is the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.000 
pretty loud pretty damn loud is the
answer<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.840> loud<00:02:48.200> sound<00:02:48.650> and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
answer to that it is is a loud sound and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.740 
answer to that it is is a loud sound and
I<00:02:49.640> don't<00:02:49.850> feel<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.180> compress<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.600> for<00:02:50.720> a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
I don't feel like I compress it for a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.230 
I don't feel like I compress it for a
long<00:02:50.900> time<00:02:50.930> because<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.620> loud<00:02:52.240> and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
long time because it's that loud and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.060 
long time because it's that loud and
there<00:02:53.840> are<00:02:53.960> people<00:02:54.140> were<00:02:54.380> out<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.800> they're

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.850 
there are people were out here they're
probably<00:02:55.190> gonna<00:02:55.430> get<00:02:55.580> some<00:02:55.640> good<00:02:55.880> looks<00:02:56.180> but

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
probably gonna get some good looks but

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.250 
probably gonna get some good looks but
it<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.100> loud<00:02:58.460> horn<00:02:58.700> I've<00:02:59.600> got<00:02:59.750> no<00:02:59.960> idea<00:02:59.990> how
