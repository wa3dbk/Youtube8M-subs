00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.490
 very cute, look how good we can 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.970
 work it directly as I showed it 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.430
 before 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.830
 there we enter we can work 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.830
 directly against everything that are 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.750
 applications the equipment is very very fluid 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.390
 and we open for example an application that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.180
 it's free to off and that's pretty heavy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 that is, it opens very very fast 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.370
 applications we can close them 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.590

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.250
 directly to what would be the screen 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.190

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.010
