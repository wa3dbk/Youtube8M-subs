00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.380
 the techno chain is now discovering an object that makes us ask 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.930
 all very well and who may be in a few years we can hope 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.070
 in our living room these hasty surface touch tablet developed by 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.210
 microsoft olivier bessieres is with us to tell you about him it's a 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.429
 good day to day 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.800
 because to make a little demo of this table 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 we will start with the app the most involved afp the photo application 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.210
 I have a picture here on a real table six points the photo pushed by the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.569
 places up front it's that way if the thrust by a point 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.880
 yes I can isolate it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.370
 who pushed her by a corner she added that the agreement that we are really 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.710
 on a background very good natural state I think yes 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 the picture 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.740
 to someone 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740
 I can choose to send it to act home for example 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.070
 what to share them 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.070
 you can the ridge 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.030
 we can really be hyper intuitive ways in the content 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.480
 meyer 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.190
 I'm also zooming is sure I do not have a young man from the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.140
 photo of jérôme colombain the fact that most of them news 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 beautiful russian regions 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.470
 then launched at his side advised him about the same way 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.860
 view video content 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.930
 to believe the same responsible surface 6% 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.780
 korian commented 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.510
 some and some passengers would tend to build themselves 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.870
 to play with the photos so we can really interact simultaneously with 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.100
 several on different elemental and 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 play to grow his tunes 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.770
 for example I can 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 directly their place in the opposite direction of betting technology here the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.030
 always selected by hand 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.460
 and time sailing 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 as for any surface application directly with my hands 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.170
 to can 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.680
 walking around which paris and finding locations I predicted made 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.360
 itineraries with very varied things 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 obviously also have access to a satellite view 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.690
 p always the same of ben ali with the hands it's not easy with two fingers 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.560
 but I will arrive 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.500
 so i help vallat and the arrival in ireland the world master strengthens 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.930
 the press that that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.160
 fabulous one can choose his holidays on May 6 hock because every song 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.490
 especially work it's a bit annoying it's well yes it's a little bit 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.370
 next day is the season roulette has already begun to work with the tree 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.719
 of jess to see what we can be 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.070
 ap after what we are there the rigor 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.900
 I can promise that their rights are hot in any case what did not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.959
 forget that google went far beyond life 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.409
 and so appreciated to know where we were going 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.389
 no more exactly no more than I am 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.729
 in many countries of the zorn a priori 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.409
 and gave an element maybe 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.239
 typically mainstream was developed in minutes on Thursday and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.689
 manages a few hours by our American partners that's called 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:42.679
 is in shape 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.439
 which has for 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.209
 deployed for its part in the sky I work for some who have spotted 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.559
 already today mix yesterday 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.239
 here realized a small application it's nice 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.050
 we will close flight attendants who can compose his techno piece around 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.399
 nine iron soldiers 9 hours a day 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.579
 it takes more than 20 years to come it's serge for the batteries there the goal of 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.349
 these compounds moment that technologies objects to master it with two 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.349
 fingers which allow me 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.749
 it's not beautiful 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.729
 here 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.559
 to have a gradual climb are more I get closer to the center more 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.109
 bulky strong 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.519
 and compose the manceau group when I can count on composing a piece 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.609
 afp 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.609
 with us 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.119
 ap 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.629
 toured nothing more 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.370
 by the way good I'm not as strong as the publisher wanted everything from 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.370
 after 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.439
 in his defense it must be given two fingers and it works 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.069
 gradually on the black market 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.469
 the surfaces it works on a vision system 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.180
 our surface is what is happening around the table which allows me to 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.609
 recognize objects I recognize shapes 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.189
 to recognize steeple graphic codes without state guard 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.699
 and interact with 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.309
 so there we are not on the application of lawyers sousse cameras 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:23.479
 center-east we will wait evolved there are five cameras surface-mounted camera 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.289
 coupled with an infrared projector 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.459
 who knows how to read the accord infrared reflected 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.099
 if I play the role of a doctor and to access the records of my patients 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.130
 I have to identify 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.349
 so components 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.129
 all right on the table on the surface code and directly recognized by the 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.270
 vision system and I can sign to the posted give different passion on 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.830
 see here besides a mode of navigation which is and which is new 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.729
 rosary farkas 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:48.900
 to choose 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.319
 to go see 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.620
 the case where a patient 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620
 so the option of things a little less glamorous but 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.680
 allows us who are more useful anyway exactly useful that allows 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.059
 to see also the operation of the 3d engine 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.809
 surface with here this little wheel that allows me 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:08.210
 to navigate% 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.520
 to rotate this object 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.469
 from every angle if I dare say 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:14.860
 to enlarge it 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.300
 to access directly here and some parts via screws and witnesses from 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.729
 regrets of radios 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.670
 also 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.159
 gold not in danger duty and there 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.199
 also 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.969
 here not nothing to propose a system 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.180
 he showed 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.150
 to patients 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.439
 what will be 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.919
 it is his operation exactly and the interest is also to show that 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.229
 I can take notes and that surface 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.120
 is a platform that allows to consult information but allows 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.499
 also to produce training of what can be returned from the contents 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:47.749
 via a virtual keyboard here that works like a normal keyboard as well 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.680
 I was facing me 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.910
 stève for example I forgot the name but hey it works perfectly 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.740
 correctly 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.490
 the judicial police 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.160
 all that is more than 5 little lighthouses
