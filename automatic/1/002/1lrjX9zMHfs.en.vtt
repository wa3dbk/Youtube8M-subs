00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.400
 particular in gmail is personal has 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.039
 there is a certain difficulty in 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.570
 synchronize the gopro with the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.369
 her remote control 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 So I'm going to show you today. 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 step as you do this timing to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.830
 show that the procedure is very simple 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.640
 and it's not because we have questions 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.120
 beauty 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 so come on first you 'll do it 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 I'm going to leave it here on a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.750
 turn on the right 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.480
 there you will find the wrench that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 there are tools confirm show approach 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.530
 it's easier for you to view 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.649
 here you will find wired.com here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.940
 brought back also confirms that it is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.530
 showing that the work because it is 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 off here in the blue light, it's not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 flashing 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 You confirm again, and then you go here. 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.140
 or the second option wifi and also stayed 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.150
 here I can change the project I have 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 who has already registered or registered a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.030
 So I 'm going to sign up for a new tac 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.979
 It's the procedure you have to do. 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.009
 confirm a new workout in the river to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.030
 confirm on this screen that this screen 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.920
 I mean, he already called Fai, too. 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.579
 and he's waiting for control issues a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.259
 signal 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.030
 so now I will put to here 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.240
 you continue to see the screen 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 It's right and now we're going to control it. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.420
 is the control in the hand here in the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.299
 behind you can already see what it says like you 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.979
 is to enter this screen will not 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.880
 stay with the seventh of sync and signal 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.409
 of synchrony 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 so it is not the record button together with 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.790
 the button call himself 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.829
 you 'll actually do the following 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.920
 first you will hold the 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.320
 record and then hold down the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.530
 turn on for about three seconds 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.080
 so come on 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.430
 I held the record button hold the button. 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.610
 To call for three seconds, I 've already released. 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.590
 showed sync signal has also sorry 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.240
 found one here already marked that gave 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.970
 right 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.800
 Then you'll see she's staying 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.450
 control will stay connected even're 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.310
 seeing and not controlling and still 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.530
 look for a signal already found a camera 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.310
 because you can control more cameras 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.230
 using the right control then the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.790
 What are you going to do here? 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.690
 have a camera you turn off already turned off 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.860
 it serves then this is a procedure 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 how do you do gopro sync 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.819
 with the card as an excuse with control 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.620
 remote beauty 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.380
 So this is it , people are the video. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.150
 It was fast the video is very short. 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.220
 just to clarify once and for all 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.670
 How do you do this procedure here? 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.860
 go to synchronization between Pro and 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 remote control of her beauty so that's it 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.440
