you know on the forest through social

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.470 
you know on the forest through social
media<00:00:59.489> don't<00:01:00.489> think<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:00.820> can<00:01:00.879> improve<00:01:01.000> so

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
media don't think that we can improve so

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.150 
media don't think that we can improve so
for<00:01:02.079> me<00:01:02.199> it's<00:01:02.379> always<00:01:02.530> about<00:01:02.739> taking<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
for me it's always about taking the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.920 
for me it's always about taking the
feedback<00:01:03.460> from<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.670> fans<00:01:03.840> incorporate<00:01:04.840> that

the core of the experience very cool and
with<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.390> next-gen<00:01:16.840> systems<00:01:17.259> what<00:01:17.560> what<00:01:18.100> do

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
with the next-gen systems what what do

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.039 
with the next-gen systems what what do
these<00:01:18.310> consoles<00:01:18.700> bring<00:01:19.060> what<00:01:19.750> do<00:01:19.810> they<00:01:19.930> offer

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
these consoles bring what do they offer

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.530 
these consoles bring what do they offer
the<00:01:20.290> NHL<00:01:20.619> friend<00:01:20.860> franchise<00:01:21.610> that<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
the NHL friend franchise that that the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.810 
the NHL friend franchise that that the
old<00:01:22.810> systems<00:01:23.170> would<00:01:23.380> not<00:01:23.560> have<00:01:23.770> yeah<00:01:24.490> they

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
old systems would not have yeah they

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.249 
old systems would not have yeah they
literally<00:01:25.299> allow<00:01:25.570> us<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.780> do<00:01:25.900> more<00:01:26.079> of

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
literally allow us to do more of

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.780 
literally allow us to do more of
everything<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:27.100> we<00:01:27.280> talked<00:01:27.520> about<00:01:27.670> the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
everything so we talked about the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.580 
everything so we talked about the
physics<00:01:28.150> for<00:01:28.270> example<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:29.229> know<00:01:29.259> we<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.530> go

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
physics for example you know we can go

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.899 
physics for example you know we can go
from<00:01:29.710> having<00:01:29.829> two<00:01:30.070> players<00:01:30.310> in<00:01:30.490> physics<00:01:30.820> at

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
from having two players in physics at

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.330 
from having two players in physics at
any<00:01:31.030> one<00:01:31.119> time<00:01:31.150> having<00:01:31.659> all<00:01:31.780> 12<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.829> allows<00:01:33.070> us

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
any one time having all 12 it allows us

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.100 
any one time having all 12 it allows us
to<00:01:33.549> have<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> puck<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.360> complete<00:01:34.659> physics<00:01:34.990> at

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
to have a puck in complete physics at

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.569 
to have a puck in complete physics at
all<00:01:35.229> time<00:01:35.439> so<00:01:35.649> really<00:01:35.860> replicate<00:01:36.250> with<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.399> punk

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
all time so really replicate with a punk

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
think about all the math behind the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.460 
think about all the math behind the
physics<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.270> puppet<00:01:40.630> he<00:01:40.689> pounces<00:01:41.020> allows<00:01:41.259> to

biggest<00:02:26.440> draws<00:02:26.590> visual<00:02:26.980> tickets<00:02:27.340> drives<00:02:27.550> but

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
biggest draws visual tickets drives but

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.550 
biggest draws visual tickets drives but
at<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.540> end<00:02:28.569> illicit<00:02:29.019> all<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> us<00:02:29.349> come

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
at the end illicit all of us come

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.620 
at the end illicit all of us come
together<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.950> packages<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.549> there<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.510> me

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
together the packages in there so for me

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.720 
together the packages in there so for me
personally<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:33.190> about<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> whole<00:02:33.489> package

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
personally it's about the whole package

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.100 
personally it's about the whole package
coming<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> mesh<00:02:34.810> between

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
coming here that the mesh between
