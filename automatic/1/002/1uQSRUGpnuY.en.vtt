right now just anchoring and again it's
it's<00:01:52.090> kind<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.510> like<00:01:52.570> dividing<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.560> window

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.080 
up the same way as when we were
shrinking<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:57.580> came<00:01:58.050> came<00:01:59.050> across<00:02:00.090> doing

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
shrinking it we came came across doing

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.880 
shrinking it we came came across doing
three<00:02:01.420> things<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.080> heat<00:02:02.260> gun<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.560> make

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
three things with the heat gun to make

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.610 
three things with the heat gun to make
it<00:02:03.070> shrink<00:02:03.660> you're<00:02:04.660> controlling<00:02:05.440> the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
it shrink you're controlling the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.980 
it shrink you're controlling the
distance<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.670> hold<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.150> heat<00:02:07.330> gun<00:02:07.630> from

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
distance that you hold the heat gun from

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.950 
distance that you hold the heat gun from
the<00:02:08.020> tinting<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.970> are<00:02:10.179> controlling<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
the tinting and you are controlling the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.960 
the tinting and you are controlling the
speed<00:02:11.320> at<00:02:11.620> which<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.980> move<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.520> heat<00:02:12.700> gun

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
speed at which you move the heat gun

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
speed at which you move the heat gun
around<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.900> window<00:02:14.230> tinting<00:02:14.740> watch<00:02:15.310> this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
around on the window tinting watch this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.760 
around on the window tinting watch this
hands<00:02:15.970> clip<00:02:16.330> from<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.690> shot<00:02:16.959> we<00:02:17.380> will<00:02:17.560> show
