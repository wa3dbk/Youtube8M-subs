15<00:02:11.250> games<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.910> maybe<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.420> better<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.810> get

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
15 games and maybe it is better to get

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850 
15 games and maybe it is better to get
experience<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
experience on it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
experience on it
roster<00:02:14.460> in<00:02:14.610> most<00:02:14.790> cases<00:02:14.910> yeah<00:02:15.390> why<00:02:15.600> wouldn't

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
roster in most cases yeah why wouldn't

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.030 
roster in most cases yeah why wouldn't
it<00:02:15.930> be<00:02:16.080> better<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.320> play<00:02:16.590> against<00:02:16.830> better

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it be better to play against better

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.410 
it be better to play against better
opponents<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.670> i<00:02:17.730> think<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.060> learning

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
opponents but i think the learning

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880 
opponents but i think the learning
experience<00:02:18.540> would<00:02:18.990> be<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> lot<00:02:19.380> better<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:19.770> they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
experience would be a lot better if they

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.170 
experience would be a lot better if they
were<00:02:19.920> winning<00:02:20.310> at<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.760> point<00:02:21.000> I'm<00:02:21.150> not
