acrylic resin that won't yellow with age
I've<00:01:09.070> already<00:01:09.429> sewn<00:01:09.670> some<00:01:10.030> seedlings<00:01:10.450> which

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
I've already sewn some seedlings which

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.149 
I've already sewn some seedlings which
I'm<00:01:10.810> now<00:01:10.960> going<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.200> place<00:01:11.409> inside<00:01:11.950> the

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
I'm now going to place inside the

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.380 
I'm now going to place inside the
propagator<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.369> next<00:01:15.640> thing<00:01:15.789> I<00:01:15.909> need<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.179> do

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
propagator the next thing I need to do

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.319 
propagator the next thing I need to do
is<00:01:16.659> feed<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.649> sensor<00:01:18.460> from<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> thermostat

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
is feed the sensor from the thermostat

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.389 
is feed the sensor from the thermostat
and<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.749> what<00:01:19.960> tells<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.890> thermostat

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
and this is what tells the thermostat

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.819 
and this is what tells the thermostat
the<00:01:21.579> heat<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.390> compost<00:01:23.170> inside<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.770> I

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
the heat of the compost inside and I

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.169 
the heat of the compost inside and I
just<00:01:24.009> feed<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.310> through<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> side<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.909> the

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
just feed it through the side of the

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.749 
just feed it through the side of the
propagator<00:01:25.689> here<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.140> then<00:01:26.829> importantly<00:01:27.189> I'm

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
propagator here and then importantly I'm

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.239 
propagator here and then importantly I'm
going<00:01:27.819> to<00:01:28.210> bury<00:01:28.539> it<00:01:28.659> into<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.319> soil<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:30.069> my

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
going to bury it into the soil of my

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:31.129 
going to bury it into the soil of my
seedlings

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:31.139 
seedlings

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.809 
seedlings
so<00:01:32.139> let's<00:01:32.799> have<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.009> look<00:01:33.130> at<00:01:33.219> our<00:01:33.310> thermostat

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
so let's have a look at our thermostat

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.969 
so let's have a look at our thermostat
the<00:01:34.329> reading<00:01:34.719> on<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.960> top<00:01:35.229> here<00:01:35.560> is<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
the reading on the top here is the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.919 
the reading on the top here is the
temperature<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.939> compost<00:01:37.359> currently

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
temperature of the compost currently

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.050 
temperature of the compost currently
inside<00:01:38.499> the<00:01:38.710> propagator<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.729> one<00:01:39.880> below

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
inside the propagator and the one below

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.419 
inside the propagator and the one below
is<00:01:40.420> what<00:01:40.630> I'd<00:01:40.749> like<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:41.469> now<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
is what I'd like it to be now the

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.760 
is what I'd like it to be now the
average<00:01:42.689> germination<00:01:43.689> temperature<00:01:44.409> for<00:01:44.649> most

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
average germination temperature for most

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.179 
average germination temperature for most
vegetables<00:01:45.399> would<00:01:45.670> be<00:01:45.880> between<00:01:46.179> 18<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.409> 21

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
vegetables would be between 18 and 21
