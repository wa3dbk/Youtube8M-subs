00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 heiner today again a video and 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.500
 I thought so yes timo lia has one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.800
 rausgehauen there are now 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.840
 Possibility to play also the 19 pp 11 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.429
 and I thought so come let me 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.310
 Let's try a bit 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.890
 who is on the server now if you like it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.769
 you have to be here with these first 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.910
 set kit settings so here 19 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.630
 melee cooldown is clocked and then can 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.630
 it actually starts 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.340
 let's jump in so I have it right now 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.500
 ever tested a bit 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:57.360
 It's really cool, I have to say 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 So it's different wild through the area 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.110
 look the way he does now 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.110
 not really that much 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.380
 you have to after each stroke 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.270
 actually always wait until this one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 Bars of these gray bars in the middle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.950
 is completely gone because otherwise you have 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.010
 her only half way 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.690
 impact force or even less 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.100
 therefore this wild through the area 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.250
 beating does not help you at all 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.660
 Wait a long while and wait 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.340
 always on it first if you then 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:42.990
 So really , that's an update 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:57.660
 as done for me so we look 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:59.090
 yet again you stink too often the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.640
 is a mistake 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.649
 yes, that's the way to win 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.920
 if you are hit much more often 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.909
 distributed as a man 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.129
 Just a little moment 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:15.519
 wait for kilometers and then to 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.519
 to have 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.500
 he has everything too fast 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.120
 now you see , I said yes 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.370
 hakuna matata is going well 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.910
 In any case, quite funny is also on 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.860
 each case pvp totally change because 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:56.290
 now it's not just who's on 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.290
 but who has the fastest can click 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.280
 who has the better attack behavior 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.489
 can wait just as moment 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.810
 is not there somehow totally in panic 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.810
 He met me before running 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:24.730
 which is also expected from 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.709
 that's great always yes now he has me 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.109
 he waited he did right 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.560
 and that's why he's neat too 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:46.049
 distributed 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:48.139
 Now watch how he can do that now 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.239
 he wait 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:54.319
 Now I look wildly through the area 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.319
 now minimal have panicked 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.880
 he has me but he has only 1 left 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.170
 gewackelt 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.170
 Well let's have a look 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:26.169
 must be you're then just you 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.340
 Wait applause because thomas the man 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.909
 Of course it should not be in the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.909
 opponents run up 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.669
 Now he does not care 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.719
 Basically , I was actually with this 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:53.439
 small video here bring so yes people 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:05:01.389
 you can look at him like he can 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:05:03.939
 me 19 no bock it still attracts on 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:08.639
 definitely one just has to turn 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.639
 But get used I think is a bock 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 it 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.600
 he has ripped too much again and again 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:34.500
 that's why he barely has me 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:35.970
 damage done today without facebook 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.320
 because I really totally 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.030
 unprepared just now 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.030
 wanted to record and thought come to me 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:06:03.200
 Minister, what are you doing, are you coming from 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.200
 second hit'll bring you real flood the 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:18.010
 there we have it again so you can 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.730
 like to try on timo write 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.830
 I also in the video 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.380
 description and otherwise I think so 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.750
 will depend here a bit 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.240
 maybe you will meet 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.890
 then here on the server and then 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.540
 I want to say the time has fallen 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.910
 like to leave my rating there and 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.930
 otherwise see you next time 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.930
