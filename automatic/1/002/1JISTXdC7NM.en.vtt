00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 and hello friends with you again vladimir 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.879
 chaykin and another little tip for 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.400
 novice tourists 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.559
 I will say again that for experienced tourists this 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.599
 will be uninteresting and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.900
 you can not slander in the comments 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.539
 Well, if we start today, we will show 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.750
 how to adjust the system 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.010
 a backpack on your back for you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.760
 comfortable to wear a backpack 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.990
 Well, let's start with the right way to wear 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.580
 I have a heavy backpack on my back 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.920
 the backpack is certainly not heavy 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 half empty principle if you have light 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.219
 backpack and you can just throw everything on 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 back without problems I think it's nothing 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.960
 talk if you go to some 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.410
 long hike and your backpack weighs more 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.809
 20 kilograms is not so easy 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.260
 wear you need either a person who 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.050
 will help you either i will now show how 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 can we do this for this we need 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.199
 grab the carry strap here here is one 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.260
 On many backpacks there is still 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.450
 auxiliary from the second side 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 or if it is not, you can take up 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.890
 shoulder strap and I will play 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 situation as if i don't have this one 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.740
 second webbing and take hold of the shoulder well 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.930
 so here we undertake the strap carry and for 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 shoulder strap 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:28.040
 set one knee forward and set 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.040
 on him a backpack so turn around 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.990
 pull up the strap and get into it 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.010
 we throw all the backpack on your back 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.080
 can shurovat now talk about 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.980
 how to adjust the backpack when you have it 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.530
 already on the back 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.280
 that plan nowhere sting nothing you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.240
 pulled back or forward 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.580
 the most important lines that regulate 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.060
 the position of your backpack on the back is 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.160
 is right here under the straps 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:08.460
 Here they are responsible for how high sits 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.590
 on you love that is they regulate 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.530
 the height of the backpack on your back 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.090
 how to determine which height suits you 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.560
 you can of course define it simply 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.710
 intuitively ordinary person right away 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.350
 understand how he is comfortable and how not well 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.510
 can be determined by the belt if the belt 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.090
 you is somewhere below then backpack 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.690
 you hang low if you have a belt 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 is somewhere already above the hips then 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.670
 backpack sits high belt should 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.989
 be here and hip bone on 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.780
 thighs and go in there buttoned and by the way 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.160
 right away 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.930
 I advise you to buy backpacks that have 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.360
 this belt because it takes more 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.380
 part of the weight with fascist 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.209
 Well, adjust the backpack height 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.360
 a backpack on your back can just 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.480
 pulling these webbing down and backpack 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.310
 rises if the backpack is heavy then 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.350
 just like that pulling is pretty hard 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.980
 so you can bend a little and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.830
 do so here to lower 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.320
 the backpack just needs a finger 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.260
 you go up and she goes down and 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.170
 exultant descends that way 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.390
 what else have the following too pretty 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:42.140
 important sling that regulates 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:47.990
 the position of the backpack is here on on 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.200
 shoulder she adjusts how closely pressed 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.940
 backpack to your back 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.070
 let's say here and so see yes backpack u 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.760
 I hang out in the distance if it is a sling 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.430
 we let go and tighten and backpack 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.650
 approaching the back mask 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.500
 if you drag these lines then you 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.380
 hands will go numb 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.010
 so, too, you need not to overdo it 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:17.540
 look at your convenience what else is there 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.950
 Backpack on the backpack there is still a chest 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.060
 sling on fast exe it is needed for that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.150
 to work with your hands in principle on 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.770
 transitions I did not fasten it and I 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.480
 probably used at all for all his 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:38.180
 hiking life two times the strength therefore 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.010
 if you save weight you can take off if 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.080
 you often use 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.170
 but if you need to do any 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.520
 hand movements then you button and 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.790
 thanks and straps you have no 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.010
 run around backpack us drops degree 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.090
 but walking it puts pressure on the chest in 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.950
 anyway me and 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.530
 and shade days are very comfortable what else is there 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.180
 on backpacks that's not at all of course but on 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.330
 Most if you have a belt 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.750
 more precisely a belt if thatâ€™s such 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.980
 also attracts the bottom of the backpack 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.350
 your back 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:20.620
 so she sat more tightly the same 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:23.600
 the story is released the backpack is loose 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.230
 tightened all nothing dangles you 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.600
 backpack sits very tight that's probably 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.430
 all friends were the basics of adjustment 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.190
 backpack on different models there is again 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.570
 we are additional lines I think with them you 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.540
 already figure it out yourself 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.150
 these were the main points that you 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.830
 may come in handy like you were 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.110
 Vladimir Chaikin subscribe to my 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.730
