you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.400> see<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:23.209> didn't<00:02:23.510> take<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.930> I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you can see and it didn't take it I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.050 
you can see and it didn't take it I
think<00:02:25.250> it's<00:02:25.400> case<00:02:25.730> sensitive<00:02:26.379> which<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:28.060> don't

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
think it's case sensitive which I don't

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.979 
think it's case sensitive which I don't
I'm<00:02:30.019> not<00:02:30.200> too<00:02:30.349> fond<00:02:30.590> about<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.540> whatever<00:02:32.540> i'll
